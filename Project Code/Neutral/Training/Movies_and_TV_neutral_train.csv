Review,Rating
"I loved this movie and took my young daughter to see it when it came out.  It is a beloved favorite. I downloaded it on Amazon Prime for my little granddaughters to watch when they were visiting.  The quality of the sound was so bad, I thought something was wrong with my speaker system, or some little fingers reset something and screwed it up. But, no, that was not it.  I checked my system with some other movies, tv shows and music on Prime and everything was fine.  Went back to ""Annie"" and again terrible sound quality.  The girls lost interest in the movie about 1/3 of the way in, and I'm sure that had to do with the sound.  I know it's an older movie, but I never had this happen before.",2.0
beautiful nature - the movie is just ok - wouldn't recommend it - pretty boring at times - had to fast forward it.,2.0
"Really. I grew up loving Robert Redford. And his voice is about the only thing good about this film with the exception of the cinematography (and the native chick's hair). But visuals do not make a story. Please...the book is a separate issue. I can imagine if you read it, this might make a great accompaniment to the story but on its own - uh uh.

Yes, it is begging to be some sort of metaphysical contemplative puff piece on the nature of family, love, existence, blah blah blabbity blah! What this film lacks are strong characters, heroes, thoughts, ideas, a plot, and anything else worthy of the concept of ""story"". Is it a visual poem? Maybe. But is it good poetry? Does it show why life is worth living? No. It does show why fly fishing is worth pursuing or why Montana may indeed be a nice place to visit or that all young men should grab a hot native chick off of a reservation and get thrown in jail with her.

Legends of the Fall is infinitely better in every single aspect than this little annoyance if you're into Pitt and the whole Bad Brother routine.

You know people who love to have coffee table books around, or Marxist dialectical imperative pamphlets lying around that they pretend to read? Or Jean Luc Godard films that they pretend to understand? Well this my friends is the American equivalent. Think Antonioni but without Monica Vitti and Alain Delon. And Eclipse almost made me gouge my eyes out.

In truth, sans sarcasm, I really wanted to love this film. I did not. I will not. I cannot. As it sadly suckity suck sucks!

God bless all of you. And please, at least admire me for standing up to all who come here to echo your own praises.

Let's be honest - all the reviews here are really just buds of Redford trying to make him feel good. Or worse...Robert himself with over 250 fake accounts. Really Robert...for shame!",2.0
To weird for me.  Didn't understand most of it.,2.0
Love the movie but horrible sound!!,2.0
I admired Robin Williams but I did not like all of his shows or movies.  This movie was wacky and I just could not get into it.  It is also a little bit raunchy--I am not a prude but this was a little much.  Most of all the plot was too weird for me.,2.0
"In its day (1991) this movie may have worked for many people, as I remember enjoying it.  However, it now seems overly contrived.  Neither the Jeff Bridges character, nor the Robin Williams character, seem very believable.  I felt I was wasting my time watching it again.",2.0
My 8 year daughter was really disturbed by the mean lady.  My 5 year old son was bored.  I was disappointed in the plot.  We didn't finish watching the movie.,2.0
"I've seen better movies with these actors. The best part was the park scene, other than that it was slow, a guy down on his luck.",2.0
It is an ok movie.  The problem with this movie is its too long.  The movie could have been cut by at least 45 min.  You learn about the main characters too many times - once is enough.  If you have 2 hours and 17 min to kill then watch the movie.,2.0
My husband couldn't handle the singing...which it was a musical.,2.0
"This is one of my favorite movies, and definitely my favorite of Terry Gilliam's. That is the reason I was very disappointed in this Blu Ray release that is nothing but a straight transfer from DVD at best with no extras whatsoever. Wait for a decent release. I would give it one star, but I actually love this movie and couldn't bring myself to do it....",2.0
"Generally unbelievable film about a man's dissolution and redemption.  Jeff Bridges does a magnificent job with the material; unfortunately, Robin Williams is miscast as a crazy person (who has gone crazy by an act that was precipitated by Jeff Bridges' character).  Williams should have played his part with some degree of complexity, but all that comes out is tics and showiness.  What a shame.  The script is uneven, in parts very insightful and in other places simply stupid (the dinner with the four main characters is just awful).  If a the movie and therefore the script had been shortened by 30 minutes, the movie would have been much better.  As it is, the unbelievability overwhelms whatever good points the movie has.  Too bad.",2.0
It arrived on time but the DVD skips.,2.0
"Firstly, it's totally unacceptable that it's not in 2.35.1. You see more, and so you should. Secondly, it's probably one of the worst movie musicals ever made. One star for Carol Burnett, and one for Ann Reinking's all too brief dancing. I like the 'We've got Annie' dance number, even though it's completely out of the wrong period that the film is set in. The film though, in trying to blow a paper thin stage show up with a third rate score into an elephantine extravaganza, completely loses what little charm the show had. But many people love it, so I'm happy for them.",2.0
"Our 3 year old niece loves this movie, so we bought it for her to watch here.  The picture quality is very good, but it is not in sync with the sound.  She's too young to notice it, but I am not happy with this purchase.",2.0
"Like the story - have seen it many times.  This one, however, I could not watch  the DVD because something was wrong with the program.  I could not get it to go beyond the notice to all viewers not to copy the film  Love the movie...but this one I could not watch.  The DVD would not let me get past the warning that most of the DVD-

I could not and won't be rating this one...I never did get to see it.  When I put the DVD into the machine, the movie played as far as the warning that is always on at the beginning....and never left it.  It flashing off it and you would think the movie is going to start now....and then it came back to the waning again.  Had to send it back.",2.0
It wasn't appropriate for a four-year-old.  Perhaps it is just that the times have changed but Carol Burnett's language and attire were too much!  We turned it off.,2.0
I paid $5 extra for the HD version and it looked pretty good considering its an old movie HOWEVER..there have been times after that where the picture quality was awful and no way the HD version on top if that it seems so stop and load several times during playing.,2.0
"Audio is terrible. Difficult to understand dialogue. Picture not great, but old source.",2.0
"This version needs to go through a lot of buffering.  Therefore, it take a lot more time to watch this movie.",2.0
Not really sure what makes this special. This review is for the quality not the movie itself which we love. The picture quality is TERRIBLE. Worse than an old VHS. Weird.,2.0
Very poor audio quality.  Distorted aspect ratio.  Almost bootleg quality!,2.0
"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars and not 1 is that a couple of the performances were decent, Quinn and Finney. I agree with the editorial review, its like the movie was filmed in a void. There is very little heart to it. And then they have the scene toward the end where the Rooster character is chasing Annie up a tower!! Excuse me, but this is supposed to be a charming little story, and not some thriller. And then they also take one of my favorite numbers from the show, NYC, and replace it by that insipid ""At the Movies"". The dance numbers, mostly by Reinking, were also terribly overblown. The TV movie version with Kathy Bates was far superior.",2.0
"This is ""encrypted"" so I couldn't download it to my computer and look at it later. My fault, I guess lots of ""commercial"" DVD sets are like that. At any rate, I won't bother buying any more DVD's at AMAZON. I am going to have an operation soon and wanted to be able to watch RUMPOLE on my Mac Airbook; as the AIRBOOK doesn't have a DVD reader that meant wanting to extract RUMPOLE in my desktop and then moving it to the airbook. Life is like that. I gave it to St. Vincent de Paul.",2.0
"The picture quality is not great, but the audio is awful, very muddled. Someone likened the quality to a bootleg video in another review and I couldn't agree more.",2.0
"I loved this series when it first came out as did my mother.  Trouble is she is now 86.  Rumpole is  known for mumbling a lot of derogatory comments under his breath and the sound quality and picture quality is so poor it makes it a chore to watch.  If it had close captioning it would be worth it, but as it stands, this is one of the few items that I am sorry I bought",2.0
"As someone who watched this show on PBS in the 1970s/1980s, I was really looking forward to having the DVD set of the whole show, but then after I received it and actually started watching it, I realized that there were a lot of problems.  First of all there are no subtitles.  This is a problem because the sound quality/transfer is mediocre, and thus it's difficult to tell what is being said: there's a lot of dialogue that's spoken in heavily-accented English with regional dialects, so for an American it's hard to keep track of the story. (Presumably I was better able to watch it 35 years ago due to better sound quality on PBS, and my hearing was a lot better).

The picture quality is also not very good; this was obviously a cheap video transfer effort, so the visuals look washed-out to me.

Having only ended up watching one episode, I'm now saddled with the entire DVD set that no one else around me is interested in even watching, much less buying from me.",2.0
"I can't complain much, however, the Laserdisc was pan and scan, the DVD was pan and scan and later on released in letterbox. Yet another favourite available in proper aspect ratio albeit the nothing-special transfer",2.0
"Probably OK, but there was no indication of Closed Captions in the write-up.  They are essential for us old, hard-of-hearing but relatively affluent geezers.",2.0
I bought these after hearing several good radio theater Rumpole shows. The video Rumpole character is little more than a hopless British WC Fields less the sense of humor. I'm not sure these are worth donating to the thrift store.,2.0
"Don't buy this if you or someone watching it needs closed captioning. I bought it for my dad, but it is unwatchable because he can't tell what people are saying.",2.0
"Having spent a month & a half performing in the orchestra for the stage version of Annie, I thought I'd enjoy seeing how the movie version compared to what we did. I was disappointed, to say the least. Especially since John Huston (one of my favorite directors) was at the helm.

To me, Annie is family fare, and this movie had some elements not appropriate. There was one expression of profanity, the remainder were some suggestive dance sequences I was embarrassed to have my daughters see. And considering my daughter was an orphan in the play we did, she was taken aback at some parts of the movie, too.

And the time the movie was made showed its dated-ness. I thought the musical sequence where the driver (an Asian) and Punjab (an Indian or Pakistani played by Caribbean Geoffrey Holder) dance was stereotypical in its portrayal.

We found the Disney version, which I hope is closer to what we did.",2.0
"If you were a kid when you first fell in love with this movie, then chances are that you're all grown up now.  And if you're all grown up now, chances are that you'll abhor this DVD release as much as I do.  The people who released this DVD apparently didn't realize that since it came out in 1982, it would have a large audience of people who fell in love with it then, but have grown up to be discerning movie buyers now.  And grown-ups need things with their DVD packages, especially if those packages claim to be ""Special Anniversary Editions"".  They need things like commentary.  Sure, John Huston is long dead, but what about the living?  Why not round up Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Aileen Quinn and some of the girls for a real commentary track?  Grown-ups need in-depth making-of featurette documentaries, not sappy retrospectives narrated by Aileen Quinn as if she were talking to a bunch of grade-schoolers.  And grown-ups emphatically do NOT need cheesy sing-along and act-along with Annie features, or insipid trivia that any 8th-grade graduate could do.

The worst thing of all about this DVD is the fact that it's not presented in letterboxed format.  What kind of era are we living in that we could get a movie shot in widescreen on a pan-and-scan DVD??  It almost made me cry to realize that I was missing a third of the action in most of these shots.  Had I realized that, I never, ever, would have paid for this DVD.  Let that be a lesson in always reading the packaging carefully, and never presuming for a moment that DVD manufacturers are in tune with the needs that grown-up consumers have for their movie merchandise.  I would have given this sham of a product 0 stars if I could have, but I can't bear to give so few stars to a movie I love so much.

Looks like all I can do is keep the old tunes in mind, and modify them just a little . . . ""Tomorrow, tomorrow, maybe we'll get a better DVD release tomorrow -- it's only a day away!""",2.0
"I can't believe some of the glowing reviews people have written on here when they have watched it with their young children.  I overlooked the blatantly sexual innuendo by Carol Burnett's character, because my 5 year old has no idea what's going on there.  But there were at least two ""D*mn""s and two loud-and-clear ""G#ddamm#ts""  I knew this movie was PG, but it's Annie for goodness sakes!  And fellow reviews on here had given it a thumbs up after watching with their children.  Please!",2.0
"If you haven't already seen this one, do not wait until ""Tomorrow"", do it today.

This is one of the most delightful musicals of recent years. Great performances by Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, Carol Burnett is outstanding as Ms Hannigan and Tim Curry & Bernadette Peters make convincing nasties. The music is great and the easy-to-miss one-liners are delightful. All-in-all, a must see, and a must-possess movie.",2.0
"This movie is just plain icky.  Carol Burnett's character drinks constantly, is in her underwear most of the time, makes sexual advances to Daddy Warbucks, and does a burlesque dance with Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry.  It was embarrassing to watch with  12-year-olds.  I wouldn't show it to younger children.

The story is good. The visit with F.D.R. is interesting.  Maybe the newer version made in 1999 is more appropriate for children.",2.0
This was an ok movie not as fun as the regular show,2.0
Volume was strange.,2.0
"I saw the 1999 Annie version by Disney before this one.  I loved that one a lot.  This one just seems to be charmless.  I still love the story, but this movie did not seem to good.  It was slow and at times very dull.  Only some of the singing was good.  Nothing amazing and crisp like in an Annie play on stage.  The Annie verson from 1999 was a ton better.  Everyone looked a little more civilized and they brought the song Tommarrow back and made it Annie's song again.  In this version it is thrown in the back of things and does not make it her signature song.  I would not recommand this version, but if you want to see a great version buy the 1999 one.",2.0
Not appropriate for a 2 year old ... too much violence and fighting.,2.0
DID NOT THINK KIDS LIKED IT,2.0
Not well presented. Have seen better from Muppets.,2.0
"Having seen the original Broadway stage production with Andrea MacArdle back in 1978,this movie version directed by John Huston is a MAJOR disappointment. The movie version should have been a wonderful expansion of  the stage original, but this was not to be. Bordering on disaster, the  movie ANNIE has little to recommend it. A former review posted here by  Carolyn says it all. The movie replaced great songs from the stage  original(NYC,etc) with horrible new ones (DUMB DOG, WE GOT ANNIE, LETS GO  TO THE MOVIES,etc). There is nothing in this film that evokes the 1930s  Great Depression era the movie takes place in (where is the HOOVERVILLE  sequence). The movie in loaded with errors in regard to time and place. For  example, if Warbucks' 5th Ave Mansion is as expansive as shown in the  movie, it would have to located in Central Park; the movie Annie attends is  CAMILLE which never played at Radio City Music Hall and premiered in 1937  (not 1933 when the movie takes place, in fact RC Music Hall opened in late  1932); in the stage version the chracters attend a performance at the ROXY  Theatre which is as it should be; the New York in the movie ANNIE is a  mixture of unconvincing Hollywood sets and poor location shots which have a  1970s look and feel(why so many modern buildings in the background). Annie  as performed by Aileen Quinn is a pint size Ethel Merman who looks strong  enough to take on an army, she exhibits little heart and comes across as a  phony. Most of the other cast members are wasted or under perform thier  roles. Which brings me to the awful finale as presented in the move; the  stage version ends at Christmas while the movie becomes a summer circus;  Miss Hannigan is carried off to jail in the original while in the movie she  is seen drunkinly riding a circus elephant. What were producer Ray Stark  and John Huston trying to do? It baffles me to this day. Watch the ABC  Disney version of ANNIE it is not as good as the stage original but much  better than this awful movie version.",2.0
Too chaotic,2.0
My 2 year old grandson wasn't a fan. It was a bit too much for him.,2.0
It was okay,2.0
My kids didn't like it,2.0
I was surprised at the language and the frequent use of the F word.  I was hoping to show this classic to my 10 year old grandkids but will not be doing that.  Now that I'm 65 having never seen the complete film I found it to less funny that the few clips they normally show.  As with most film previews in 2 minutes they can show all the funny parts of the film.,2.0
Not interesting,2.0
Not in the same class as Mel Brooks films. Ok to watch for reference because have seen some of the material reused.,2.0
"Love this movie, but the supposedly new disc has a scratch of some sort and freezes at the Knights that say ni.",2.0
My kids watched it. Didn't love it.,2.0
Not at this time,2.0
"It entertained the kids- a little. So I'd give it 2 stars. However, it was quite torturous for the adults.",2.0
My son is not quite 3 and this movie is really scary for him. I'm not sure what age kid could enjoy this!,2.0
"Box came very beat up, although disc was fine.",2.0
"Not an all time great.  Simple plot line, was happy it ended.  See Cinderella Man if you want to see a quality depression era movie about a boxer.",2.0
"It has its moments that are genuinely funny, but it is still essentially a cheesy, low budget comedy with poor special effects. Hadnt seen it since I was in college 30 years ago. Now I remember why I didn't like it much then.",2.0
It was ok,2.0
"The movie was ok but not as good as the original
Many parts are left out sad because they left out some of the funniest parts",2.0
My son didn't care for this and never finished watching it.,2.0
My child is 3 and did not enjoy this movie. The plot was too thick. There is a 'bad guy' who ends up in jail. Overall disappointed.,2.0
"Annoying!! My daughter loves this movie but I hate it. It drives me nuts. The acting is terrible (even for a kid's show) and it goes on forever. Better lessons on sharing and not being greedy have been taught in less than 20 minutes but this is a full length film. All the crazy stuff going on takes away from the actual message. The songs are horrible. But my daughter loves Elmo, so she loves it. That's really all this movie has going for it.",2.0
Ok for an Elmo movie. Lots of sarcasm in the dialogue. Not my favorite in this series,2.0
"This was recommended to me by an old time lawyer. I didn't think he was gay in any way, but after watching this movie, I can most assuredly say he is super gay for Charlie Bronson... This entire flick should be called, middled aged greased up Bronson has terribly choreographed bare knuckle fights. With no real moral to the story expect that Charles Bronson always wins a bare knuckle boxing match, unless you love super cheesy, 60's (?) era versions of Fight Club, save your time.",2.0
The siege engine is a cheap piece of plastic you insert into the box to flip the plastic animals.  I was hoping for a tiny trebuchet.,2.0
2 year old love's Seasame sreet. She wasn't having any of this show.,2.0
"I was expecting more and disappointed. One could sum up this movie in one sentence ""tough guy wins some fights"". Also, it is sort of hard to buy as Charles Bronson is old and the other fighters were just as old. I won't watch this again, in my opinion not worth watching.",2.0
There was something wrong with the programming when this one was manufactured.  Kept repeating and never ever got to the end.  A glitch that kept on happening. Very frustrating.  Peed me off big time for an evening.,2.0
Way too hectic for little children.  Lots of extraneous noise.  Very frantic pace.  Would not recommend.  Muppets movies much better.,2.0
"Wish a reivew had alerted me, but I should have checked the aspect ratio before purchase anyway. The movie is pan and scan other than the credits. A real rip-off. I'm not waiting to rate the movie, guess I'll do that whenever I get to SEE the whole thing. Whatever the strengths of the movie, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PRODUCT.",2.0
"HARD TIMES (1975) - (Walter Hill, dir.)
With Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Jill Ireland and Strother Martin.
Set in New Orleans in the early '30s, this streetboxer story is considered by many to be Bronson's best movie.

""Hard Times"" is quite enjoyable but this particular edition from GOODTIMES only rates two stars because of manufacturing limitations. The brand dubbed tapes in LP mode, thus they have a degraded picture quality compared to SP transfers. Audio is linear mono instead of the far superior HiFi stereo.

For anyone who seeks a quality VHS of this work, you'll be pleased with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1996-SONY-COLUMBIA/dp/6303257658/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1996 SONY/COLUMBIA</a>&nbsp;version.",2.0
grand son hated this dvd. i guess elmo is played out now.,2.0
"I love this movie, but this transfer is horrible.  The brutally abrupt pan and scan cuts literally made my head spin at points.  The film is great, and worth watching, but I hope they put out a widescreen version one day.  Maybe  they'll do a Walter Hill boxed set with deluxe versions of all his classics. Rent this one until they do, but don't spend money on it.",2.0
My son is a huge Elmo fan but this movie did not hold his attention.  After reading the reviews I just figured my son would be captivated. It now collects dust with all the other movies my son has rejected.,2.0
"We aren't normal Sesame Street watchers. The occasional Elmo's World but that's it. But my child is 2 and I felt the villain character was fairly scary and the overall concept was kind of weird, ala Dante's inferno except it was trashland.",2.0
"Not as bad as The meaning of life, but not very funny. Just dumb.",2.0
My son (who LOVES Elmo) didn't like this show and was so bored with it he asked me to turn it off. He's 3!,2.0
"Must be getting old!  All the good stuff I remember about the movie happenes within the first 10 minutes, leaving me to wonder why I wanted to see this again.
Oh well, age will tell!  What was at one time witty and in your face now seems sophomoric and just plain juvenile.  Wish I was 21 again and could enjoy it, but then again, wish I was 21 again and could enjoy everything from way back then, lol!",2.0
"Let me start by saying, like my title says, my 18 month old LOVES this video!! It is one of the few that he will sit down and watch all the way through without making a peep.  Unfortunately I am trying to get him to watch other videos instead because this doesn't teach the greatest lessons.
First of all, you have Huxley (Mandy Patinkin)who yells alot and specifically yells MINE alot. All well and good if your child is old enough to understand that's not nice but for younger children, they just pick up the MINE since it is emphasized in the yelling. Young kids WILL pick this up. There is even a ""mine"" song that we skip everytime we watch the video.
Second, there are a few questionable things that Huxley says, calling Elmo names and taunting him.  At one point, he calls Elmo a little red bathmat only it doesn't really sound like bathmat.
The rest of the movie is okay, minus Huxley, I don't know if they picked the wrong actor or just wrote his character poorly but either way it's really too bad.  I find the rest of the songs catchy and am okay watching the movie over and over, skipping over some of the Huxley parts of course
As a note: the chicken at the end may be a little scary since it tries to eat Elmo but my son wasn't afraid and he's usually pretty sensitive to that kind of stuff.
In terms of Elmo movies, Cinderelmo is a little more mellow and less nasty and I like Kathy Najimy far better as the main human character. Premise is still pretty silly but at least I don't have to fast forward through any parts.",2.0
"I should have watched this first before popping it into the car dvd player...about 15-20 minutes into it she started crying and saying NO NO ELMO NO! She was very effected, maybe next year she will like it more. We have a couple other Elmo videos that we love, not this one though.",2.0
"I thought this movie would be a lot of fun for my 2 year old who loves Elmo. I was having fun watching it in the beginning, and wish I could have seen the entire movie. However, about 15 minutes through Elmo encounters a ""scary"" helicoptor, and a villian who takes away his blanket. My daughter burst into tears. I could only console her by skipping to the end to show that Elmo got his blanket back. Two weeks after viewing she is still talking about the scary helicoptor and mean man. She, of course, would not let me put the movie in again, no matter how I assured her it was just silly and not scary.",2.0
I bought this movie for my daughter when she was 2 1/2.  She has always loved Elmo. We did not make it through the first few minutes because she was in hysterics when elmo was loosing his blanket.  I recently tried it again now that she is 4 and she still can't handle the stress of this movie.  I think that she just identifies with Elmo so much and she is just so worried about him.  She litterly sobbed and called out Elmo's name.  I am sure it is fine for some kids... but not if your child is very sensitive like mine. I will be giving this movie away.  She has never had a reaction like this to any other movie.,2.0
"We popped this movie in and my little guy sat down to watch it... he usually doesn't sit still for more than a few minutes of television - but he loves Elmo, so he sat and watched until the Mean Huxley took Elmo's Blanket.  At this point he broke out into tears - He's only 17 months... but I would guess many children could react this way.  I had to fast forward the movie to the part where Elmo got his blanket back before he stopped crying.  Now he asks to take HIS blanket out of his crib when he gets up - he never did this before watching the movie.

I don't reccommend it to little ones who might get frightened.",2.0
"We bought this video because my 2 and a half year old is a huge Elmo fan.  The opening song, ""together forever"" is great as is the scene in the laundrymat, ala STOMP.  But then my son gets completely turned off. In fact when Elmo gets sucked into Grouchland, my son got scared.  The bad guy is really mean to Elmo and we never get past the first 10 minutes or so of this movie before my son leaves the room.  What a disappointment. I think that this is a movie for older children, unlike most of the other Sesame DVDs that we have. As I read other reviews, the very positive ones are from older kids. We will see if my son changes his mind when he is a bit older.",2.0
"My 3 year old son likes Elmo but, he absolutely hates this video. When he asks to watch a video, he specifically states, ""but not Grouchland.""  His Mother and I found it to be mildly entertaining for adults (unlike that horrible Thomas and the Magic Railroad which, of course, my son loves).  Maybe, as he gets older, he will like it.  That is, if he will ever let us put it on again.",2.0
"Just not my type of humor, but I wanted to see it.",2.0
This movie sucked it was not funny. Some may enjoy this I didn't.,2.0
You need to be a good Monty Python fan. A little too slap stick for me and old school humor.,2.0
Fairly funny.,2.0
I expected this to be more like Spamalot than it was.  It became very tedious and labored in its attempts to be funny.  The deliberate anachronisms didn't help.,2.0
"This is good for about the first five minutes, and after that it becomes increasingly boring. The gags are too simplistic and obvious. And I like Monty Python!",2.0
"Buy the Blue Ray version, not the Collectors Edition, if quality of the visuals is important.  This is not, NOT a Blue Ray high quality rendition.  The quality of the recording is disappointingly bad.  Reading the cut and paste reviews, I know I got confused about which was what.  If you want the extra's, the Japan release for example, this edition is fine.  If you don't care about that but want a better visual experience, don't buy this one.  Buy the Blue Ray.",2.0
"Liked the stage version so much better.  Love British humour but this was even a wee bit bizarre for them.  Did not help that the case for the dvd did come damaged as well, could return but probably will give as a gift to someone who will enjoy more than I.  I would skip this and just enjoy on youtube.",2.0
"People said this was very funny but I did not like it all that much, so maybe its just me.",2.0
This is a classic movie that I love but I gave it two stars because the QUALITY of the video is substandard.. I would expect this from a bootleg site not from a legitimate site.  It will make me think twice about ordering another digital movie from here again.,2.0
"I've seen this movie 4 times now and ever since the first time I sit there wondering ""What the heck do people think is funny in this movie"" - Than I realized that if I had been high when I watched it this movie probably would have been hilarious!  That's actually a good thing because than I could have some killer food and laugh at this stuff even though usually I'd just turn it off lol",2.0
"The English comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin), is widely known for its series of humorous sketch shows, broadcast on television in the early 1970s. Much of their work was a humorous combination of the creative, farcical, and surreal, such that the group's influence on subsequent comedy was significant. In ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", they tried their hand at a feature length film that spoofed the Arthurian legends and the quest for the holy grail, with a parody of the chivalrous knights of medieval tales. Being a fan of the Arthurian legends and of parody, it was this combination that first attracted me to this film, as well as the fact that it is often regarded as one of the greatest comedy films of all time.

But does Monty Python & the Holy Grail live up to this reputation?  The influence and popularity of Monty Python is indisputable, but that does not mean that this comedy troupe has found favour from all quarters. Certainly they display the potential to come up with some extraordinarily creative and original humor, appreciated especially by those who find the surreal and absurd in any way funny.  But it is regrettable that the humor of their television shows often descends into the risque and irreverent.  Monty Python and the Holy Grail is no different in that it contains both the usual brand of Python humor, as well as a significant amount of irreverence and sexual innuendo. Some parts are funny, in fact tremendously so, for who can ever forget the defeat of the killer rabbit with Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, the three-headed Knights that say ""Ni--!"", the Bridge of Death with its absurd riddles, and the closing scenes where our heroic knights are conquer the grail, only to be arrested by British policemen.  But the clever humor doesn't excuse the large amounts of blasphemous material, which frequently is used as a source of humor in connection with the religious aspects of the grail. Monty Python took their irreverence even a step further in a subsequent film, Life of Brian, which is a parody of the Biblical Messiah Jesus Christ. But it's not just unholy religious humor that's problematic here - discerning viewers should realize that ""the Holy Grail"" also contains some risque sexual innuendo in the usual Monty Python style.  And these moral concerns aside, there are cases in ""the Holy Grail"" where the surreal attempts at humor just aren't funny, but stupid.

Critiquing a sacred cow is always dangerous, not least when this films is regarded one of comedy's holy grails.  But those of us who err on the side of conservatism with our moral standards will want to give this film a miss. For a more innocent parody of chivalry which avoids the unholiness and irreverence of this humor, try instead Goldman's The Princess Bride. - GODLY GADFLY",2.0
"Nothing to say about the film itself - simply a word of warning about the box set: it appears from the product listing to be simply a copy of the ordinary 2 DVD edition - which retails for less than half the price of this boxed set - with a copy of the screenplay and some cards and senitypes (whatever they are) thrown in.

 The complete screenplay can be obtained from literally hundreds of places on the net - just try googling on ""anarcho-syndicalist commune"" and you'll see.

 You do the maths. Twenty bucks for some cards?

"This is a great movie preformed by the legendary comedy troupe Monty Python.  I have nothing to say about the movie, other than everyone should watch it at least once even if you're not a Python fan.  This review is to serve as a warning to potential purchasers.  I purchased this movie only to find the discs were scratched due to a poor packaging design.  This 2 disc set stacks both discs one on top of the other on a single bracket, without a separator.  If you are unlucky like me the bracket was rather lose allowing the DVD's to rotate independently of one another, resulting in many tiny scratches rendering the feature DVD unreadable.  You can find the exact same features on the Special Edition (Wide Screen Edition) but without the movie cel and script, not to mention saving yourself some 20 bucks.",2.0
"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the greatest comedies of our time (in fact I think I'm going to watch it right now,) however, this ""Collector's Edition"" is just the same as the ""Special Edition"" but it comes in a fancy-dancy box and comes with a book (whooooooo!!!!) and a film cell (aren't you impressed, I thought so.)

"I'm not sure what it is that I don't like about this movie. It seems there is something off balance that is apparent from the opening sequence. Obviously all the reveiws for this movie were written by fans. Most people who wouldn't like this movie most likely have not heard of it, or barely remember. It does not leave a lasting impression unless you find it hilarious. Filmed on a shoestring budget and probably in locations within just a few miles of each other, this movie is a journey into the bizarre and dryer then a dessert humor of one of Englands most popular comedy troups. Rest assured, if you like English humor, this movie will most likely leave you rolling on the floor. For some who just can't laugh that hard at it, you may find yourself giving up on it early. There is some tremendously funny writing and some very cerebal wit. For example, the argument about whether a swallow can carry a coconut during it's migration. The taunting of the Frenchman from the top of the castle wall. The dual with the black knight, and the killer bunny. The hightlight being the peasent in the road who King Arthur mistakes for an old woman and gets a tougue lashing for the simple mistake. Even these moments though rely on the bizarre circumstance that these people don't ride horses but pretend to with the sounds they make with two coconuts to show you that there is absolutly nothing to be taken seriously and nothing that shouldn't be considered off the wall. This movie seems funnier when quoteing lines in the company of friends, rather then watching it straight out. My personal tastes do not run to something this unbalanced, but I realize it is adored by many. So to those who enjoy it, knock yourselves out. To those who enjoy more straight foward smart comedy, I would suggest Real Genius.",2.0

Sure, it looks better than my VHS copy, and for that I'm grateful.  But there was no attempt made to clean up simply things like dust and fiber from the print.  In addition the sound is mastered at a volume that is too low to do much with.  Any other disc I watch, my system rattles the room.

"The first 30 minutes or so of Gattaca are pretty great. We're introduced to a not-so-distant (and relatively plausible) future world where ""natural"" birth is performed in vitro under the guidance of geneticists who carefully engineer/select the most genetically gifted and healthy zygote. From birth, people are identified and defined entirely by their genetic makeup and the diseases to which they are or are not predisposed. The film does a really great job of exploring the philosophical, moral, and legal implications of such a society, and the resultant discrimination that ""invalids"" - those who are born in vivo - face both in their health insurance and job prospects. There's also a nice underlying message that is touched upon: often times the best person for a job may not be the absolute smartest or healthiest candidate, but the one who is the most passionate about the work.

It really is a shame though that, after a great setup, the story the film actually delivers is that of a by-the-numbers, mediocre sci-fi thriller. A good hour or so of the film's hour and 45 minutes is spent on a string of close-calls where our protagonist - an ""invalid"" posing as a ""valid"" in hopes of fulfilling his dream of space travel - evades authorities who are on his trail. That's pretty much it. There is barely any character development that occurs during this section of the film (or even after for that matter) and the juiciness of the world and its moral implications is neglected in favor of underwhelming ""thrills"" as Ethan Hawke thinks on his feet to evade being discovered.

Uma Thurman is given essentially nothing to do. At the outset, she is a relatively intriguing character - possibly another invalid posing as a valid - and there seems to be promise of future development where we learn more about her. Instead, her character ultimately amounts to a love interest for Hawke so that we can have a melodramatic scene towards the finale backed by a sappy string arrangement. Her character goes nowhere and ends up being completely flat.

Finally, there's that ever-so-necessary plot twist at the end of the film which I won't spoil, but feels extremely contrived and implausible. And even if it wasn't so contrived, the revelation ultimately doesn't even amount to much of anything in terms of character or plot development. It's basically just used for a laughably ""climactic"" scene which is meant to mirror a scene from earlier in the film. It all just ends up feeling cartoony.

Still, credit where credit is due. At the very least, Gattaca did have some interesting ideas and a well-realized vision of the future that felt very plausible and saved the film from being absolutely awful. After a great opening though, it devolved into a flat thriller which ultimately nose-dived at the finale, squandering the potential it had to be a great, thought-provoking sci-fi film.",2.0

"I first saw this movie around 2000, not long after it came out and since I never saw it again,I held this idea of it in my mind all this time as being a great movie. I saw it again last week and was shocked at how much my perception of it had changed. The main character Andrea was terrifically smart academically but  dumb as a post in her thinking process and the choices she made. The whole movie is about her chasing after this guy who happens to be a local rock star. In the process of this chase she does a lot of stupid things like lose her virginity to  a guy she doesn't even really like so she will have some experience  when ""Todd"" ,the rock star finally gives her more than a passing glance. Other idiot moves including going over a 100 miles to a concert to see him,only not to be able to get in and spends all night in a raining alley. Then she basically dumps her friend Darcy because she didn't fit into the whole new indie rock scene she has inserted herself into to try to get closer to ""Todd Sparrow,the rock star."" Finally, she gets her wish, and Todd notices her. He takes her back to his place, bangs her, then leaves for another city to record an album and she hardly hears from him for weeks, which of course means she has to chase after him some more. Then, finally she gets the golden prize. She becomes Todd's girlfriend and then goes on to degrade herself by doing things like having sex with him on the floor behind a speaker while his bandmate looks on impatiently and having sex with him in a barn at a concert where people are milling about.
Finally, she figures out that Todd is basically a shallow, self absorbed jerk and leaves him to go off to college feeling like""a real woman."" Maybe it's because I'm a lot older now than when I saw this the first time but I could only feel annoyed throughout the film. I guess I no longer have much tolerance for behavior like Andrea's.",2.0
"I have probably spent more time on ""Girl"" than it warrants, just consider this a public service to prospective viewers who are unable to make head or tail out of the wide range of comments already posted. As to the quality of its adaptation from the novel, I won't go there because there is no purpose in ""apples to oranges"" comparisons and many others have relentlessly addressed the adaptation issue.

Bottom line the movie version of ""Girl"" is a mess-which can be guessed without even viewing. Made-for-cable movies back in 1998 were generally lousy and not the mix of quality that they are in 2005. Neither director Jonathan Kahn nor writer David Tolchinsky had done a feature before ""Girl"" and neither has done anything since 1998. Just do the math.

""Girl"" is pretty much what you would have if ""Almost Famous"" had been a long episode of ""My So-Called Life"". Dominique Swain plays the main character (Andrea Marr), basically the Penny Lane character in ""Almost Famous"". Swain's usual acting style is to brazen her way through roles, subtlety and nuance are not words that have ever been used to describe her performances. But in ""Girl"" she comes closest to a carefully crafted performance and actually shows some restraint. Perhaps this is because of her voice-over narration, which serves as a counterpoint to her actions on the screen. She has a nice voice when reined in and she was still very cute in 1998.

The most obvious problem when adapting a novel is that the screenplay can include only a fraction of the material. The more characters included in the adaptation, the more shallow the character development. This is one of ""Girl's"" most obvious flaws as there is little reason to connect or care about any of the supporting characters, their quirks exist but we receive no background information so we can never understand why. There is Rebecca (Summer Phoenix) - a big-time grunge music fan who rambles on constantly about music trivia and sex. Rebecca gets the movie's best lines. There is Darcy (Selma Blair) - a walking eating disorder who is supposed to be Andrea's best friend although all they choose to showcase is her resentment of Andrea. There is Cybil (Tara Reid) - A nihilist grunge rocker with a bad home life and a lust for Andrea. Despite Tara Reid being shockingly good in this role (by far her best performance ever) the part is so poorly written and false that it should have omitted from the screenplay. There are Kevin (Channon Roe) & Richard (Christopher Masterson) - class geeks who appear in the school cafeteria as part of Cybil's band and seem to have otherwise been omitted from the screenplay. Finally there is Todd (Sean Patrick Flannery) who is Andrea's main love interest and seems embarrassed about even being associated with this movie-he and Swain have no chemistry and seem genuinely uncomfortable together.

Girl's fatal flaw is that it can't decide if it is a comedy, a drama, or a coming-of-age story. Since the humor is confined to an occasional witty line it isn't much of a comedy, the only indication that it was meant to be a comedy is some over-the-top humor about an abusive jock being hit over the head with a board and knocked out. Once is not enough as this nonsense is repeated later in the film. Although not even remotely funny it must be there to let the viewer know that this is a comedy as there are never any consequences to those committing the criminal assault (insert ""Three Stooges"" here). The comedy aspect is finally abandoned and the last few minutes treat us to Lifetime triple feature of teen suicide, bulimia, and homosexuality. These are tacked on with insufficient explanation, apparently because the writer and director sensed that the comedy angle was weak and they needed to qualify it as a coming-of-age story.

This genre splitting ultimately undermines the Andrea character who despite Swain's best efforts comes across as a cobbled together mix of inconsistent and conflicting motivations and behaviors-making her impossible to identify with or care about. She is intelligent (headed for an Ivy League school), beautiful, self-assured, adventurous, and has a lot of friends. You have seen this character before in ""Say Anything"" but in ""Girl"" she overnight becomes one of the most hated heroines in teen comedy history. Meaning you have sympathy only for her various victims as she virtually rapes a guy to have her first sex, unfeelingly abandons her friends for cooler ones, explores her emerging femininity without regard to the consequences, and generally acts more eight than eighteen. Swain is physically perfect for the ""Say Anything"" type of heroine but this ultimately works against as her as her transformation into parental nightmare just doesn't ring true.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",2.0
"I gave this 2 stars because I think Dominique Swan is right on - she was the most wonderful Lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n' rollers I thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever.  But, it failed to impress.  I was the Dominique Swan character, running after my favorite rock band because I was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him.  I've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that's canceled because I loved that band so much.  And my determination paid off!  *Patting myself on the back*

But the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie.  The lesbian aspect was tripe, but I realize that were I in her (Dominique's) position at her age I wouldn't understand something like that either.  The other characters were shallow, and it wasn't all that swift a story line otherwise.",2.0
"Oh the HUMANITY!...

First, the obvious: Tara Reid as Cybill? I don't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor, but it is a mystery how that happened.

Secondly, Dominique Swain just didn't act like the Andrea Marr of the book. It seemed like Dominique Swain didn't even read the book before she played Andrea. I also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around, but that's another topic.

The movie didn't have any similarities with the ""feeling"" of the book, even though the plot was (roughly) similar.

Portia DeRossi as Carla? Ummmm.... maybe?

Selma Blair as Darcy sort of worked.

(example: Cybil is gay and shaves her head after a run in with Todd.) All I can say is, if you liked the movie, READ THE BOOK. Learn the real story.

Otherwise, it tries too hard to be cool for the teen audience, and gives all the otherwise talented actors terrible dialouge to work with.

If you really liked this movie, read the book, because they changed all the characters in the movie, and it lasts for 3 years of Andrea's life.  (We are talking The Catcher in the Rye for teen girls.)  If you already read the book (and REALLY loved it), but have not seen the movie, don't bother.",2.0
"While the movie Girl has good intentions, it doesn't come close to capturing the spirit of the novel by Blake Nelson.  The book, which reads like a diary, spans several years in Andrea Marr's life.  Unfortunately, the movie packs the story into less than a year's time, scraps a good portion of the novel, and leaves many characters, if not all the characters, poorly developed.  The story and characters will remind you of My So-Called Life.  Andrea and Todd Sparrow, played by Sean Patrick Flannery, are a lot like Angela and Jordan.  The movie, however, doesn't match the quality of the show.
Dominique Swain is good as Andrea, and the supporting cast, which includes Selma Blair and Tara Reid, is decent, but this movie fails due to bad character development and a choppy story line.  Of course, I have read the book so I have trouble reviewing the movie based on it's own merit.  If you like this movie, you should definitely read the book, also titled Girl.",2.0
"Make no mistake, ""Gattaca"" is a science fiction film with a vitally important message.  It would have made an outstanding episode of ""The Twilight Zone"".  But for a two-hour feature film, the story feels so padded that I had great difficulty staying awake through the recycled scenes and massive amounts of Michael Bay-style sap that spent too much time affirming the audience that they are perfect just the way they are.  In spite of it's intellectually sound premise, the film ends up insulting the audience's intelligence with populist tripe when it should have taken on a much darker, grittier tone.  The film has it's (legions of) fans though, so if you have ever questions about whether or not human genetic manipulation is something we should explore, then I'd recommend checking this out. You'll probably like it. But if mainstream Hollywood's penchant for talking down to the audience makes you clinch your teeth, pass it up and get back with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000UD0ESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>&nbsp;instead.

The premise of ""Gattaca"" is a future utopia where humans are able to be genetically engineered.  This is to say, that parents can shop for their offspring's biological traits as one would select features on a custom-designed automobile.  Innocent enough according to most people, but those of us who think these things through know where that will inevitably lead.  This is a story about that inevitability.  Ethan Hawke plays an abused minority in the film; he was born naturally through sexual intercourse the way we all were.  This makes Vincent what is referred to as an ""Invalid"".  ""Valids"" are those who had their makeup determined for the strongest and most genetically superior traits.  How can a random smattering of parents' DNA with all of the intrinsic flaws compete?  It can't.  Hawke's character is not only gnerally physically inferior, but he was born with a heart defect that all but insured he wouldn't live to see 30.  But he did.  Being a stubborn underdog we can all root for,  he is bound and determined to realize his dream of being an astronaut.  But given that every Valid on the planet is physically better qualified, people like him are only allowed to perform menial labor.  Legalized worldwide apartheid with no constitutionally unsound ramifications.  The idea bears a striking resemblance to some of the practices of Communist.  It's a simple system of picking the best people for the job so technically it's not discrimination.  No morality involved.  At all.  Hitler's vision of a Master Race is just around the corner.

Great idea for a film, no?  Sadly, I found the execution lacking and the film had trouble keeping my attention once the premise was established.  Shots of Vincent gazing longingly at the sky as rockets take off for outer space while he mops the floor are almost humorous to a cynical bastard like myself who gets his jollies blowing spitballs at such storytelling practices.  The backstory where Vincent's younger brother (a Valid; the parents didn't want to make the same mistake twice) lords his superiority over him and then loses in a swimming contest is reiterated over the course of the film again and again in such a manner that I felt that the filmmaker was treating me like an idiot.  Yeah!  I get it!  We don't like the super-people so we revel in the guy who is just like us winning.  No need to show us four more times!  I about turned the film off when his ability to outdistance his physically more able sibling is explained by Vincent by saying he never saved anything for the swim back.  But his brother never made it to the swim out so what was he saving exactly?  So all that does is give the people a line that makes no sense to cheer about.  ""Yeah, you fascist jerk!  He didn't save anything for the swim back except that he not only had enough to swim back, but he carried your sorry behind with him so obviously he did save something...  more then you in fact since you were the one drowning. Wait, what'd he say again?""  Things like that eat at the inside of my brain and make me angry that the writers and director can't even think through their own story for our benefit.  They just assumed we'd be too dumb to care.  This is not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>, damn it!  If you're going to make a cerebral film with no action at all, get your stuff straight!

The vast majority of the running time is spent watching Vincent cover his genetic tracks as he enacts a plan to join a space mission by posing as a Valid by borrowing the identity of a crippled athlete.  He has urine samples, nail clippings, hair, fake ID, and everything else to pass the constant genetic screenings.  The screenings and the fervency of those involved seem to indicate that the innocent ""best person for the job"" ideology has evolved into outright racism.  Along the way, our everyman courts a Valid played by Uma Thurman, who looks extremely genetically superior in this.  Seeing Vincent dust his skin dust off of his keyboard and enact successively more complex plans to bypass the system got old to me quickly.  I didn't much care about him nailing a hot Valid chick either. After a while, I just wanted the movie to be over already.  we all knew how it was going to end from the second he looked up at that rocket.  The rest was filler.  Very sappy filler.

As far as using film for a device to explain a complex subject such as genetic tampering, ""Gattaca"" is a triumph.  But seeing that I already was well aware of the social ramifications of such a practice, I have to judge it based on how the story affected me personally.  It didn't.  The devices were hackneyed, the characters were boring, there was no visual feast to pull it out of the fire.  As nice as it is to think that no matter what, the way we do things is always the best, the fact is that once we open that Pandora's Box, Invalids will be exactly that.  Invalid.  It's always fun to see David beat Goliath, but a more realistic take would have been appreciated.

When the underclass was abused and treated as animals, that's practically what they became.  Seeing something like that mirroring the real-life hardships of apartheid would have been much more convincing then the schmaltzy approach taken here.

"Welcome to a not too distant future where genetically superior humans get all the good jobs, while those born naturally have to piddle their way through the mundane jobs.  Enter Ethan Hawke, the ""human"" who wants to go to Titan, one of the moons of Jupiter, but to do so has to convince Gattaca, the corporation involved, that he is a genetically enhanced human.  He ""borrows"" the vital fluids of a crippled VALID, played nicely by Jude Law, and manages to get to the top of the list of space travelers.  The murder of an important director, however, may be his undoing, as his true identity becomes more and more revelant.  Critically acclaimed as one of the more intelligent of sci-fi films of the nineties, GATTACA is competently done, with nice performances from Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin and Loren Dean, but ultimately its leisurely pace and lack of true surprises makes it merely an exercise in style with a potential message overshadowed by its manipulation.

"Granted, Gattaca certainly tries to be all things to all people - it sells itself variously as a Philip K. Dick-esque sci-fi, as a Tense Political Thriller, an Edgy Romance, even as a Rumination on Filial Love and Obligation - but in my book it fails badly on every count. I am clearly in the minority on this, so I had better explain.
From the opening sequence, something is clearly amiss: I mean, extreme close-ups of exfoliated skin and toenail clippings, anyone?
Thereafter, things do not improve.
First off, the sci-fi premise is flimsy (it's a rap on the genetically programmed to be perfect humans vs. ""human"" humans debate: where ""human"" humans have become ""invalid"" citizens, electronically tagged and shut out mainstream society of perfectly engineered ""valid"" humans. But, you would think, if there is sufficient technology to eradicate human flaws at conception, then surely someone must clever enough to fix them later in life too, no?).
The special effects team (who, in fairness, didn't have much to do other than the aforementioned toenail clipping close-ups and the odd distant rocket launch) seem to have missed the last 35 years in development of special effects.
The brother vs. brother thread is schmaltz (the whole relationship can be summed up, apparently, by who was the better swimmer when they were boys), ... Good grief.
What else... oh yes, the lack of chemistry between Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke beggars belief (Thurman looks continually as if the very sight of Hawke gives her the screaming heebie jeebies), and the thriller/whodunnit piece does not import a sense of drama into the proceedings. And boy does the film need it.
The only saving grace is Jude Law, who seems to make his living these days propping up dreadful films with solid performances (see A.I. and The Road To Perdition in this regard), and who at the critical moment in the film, performs a very deft ascent of a spiral staircase without using his legs.
That is to be commended, however bad the rest of the experience.

"Why is that the majority of movies as of recent portray the future to be sterile, repressed and somewhat impending? One could go out on a limb and say that they delineate fascism. Is this subliminal commentary in regards to the lessening degree of privacy that only few seem to be concerned with? Whatever the reasoning for this peculiar generalization the sci-fi section of your local video store is flooded with dismal pre/post-apocalyptic glimpses into humanities future. Due to this abundance, I was not overtly eager to see Gattaca; it seemed to be a been there, done that forecast for mankind. After viewing Gattaca I can soundly say my assumptions were correct.
 The setting of Gattaca is a bleak (yawn) Marxist-Hitleristic society; Marxist in respect to the idea that everyone has employment and Hitleristic in respect to the ideals of rewarding perfection and weeding out impurities. Predictably, the plot revolves around an imperfect individual named Vincent Freeman who is played by the consistently less-than-enthusiastic Ethan Hawke. Vincent needs glasses to see properly and does not have a desired body structure. His brother, Anton (Elias Koteas) is his opposite, successful and highly intelligent. Sibling rivalry aside, Vincent yearns to join society as a normal individual. Vincent enlists the aid of German (Tony Shalhoub), a so-called DNA broker who sells false identities to the genetically inferior. German sets Vincent up in a partnership with Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a once superior genetic specimen who has been paralyzed in an accident and is now willing to sell his prime genetic material for cash.
  For the most part, the story delves into the shallow waters of predictability quickly and never really emerges. The average viewer knows before they press play where this scenario is going. Its fairly obvious that initially Vincent's plan will go smoothly, minor complication will begin to add up, a love interest will have some screen time (Uma Thurman) and itll wrap up with a fairly anti-climactic resolution. Though that doesnt mean Gattaca cant be pretty while doing it. In fact, Gattacas visual presentation is what salvages it from absolutely tanking. Warholesque modernistic landscapes litter the world of Gattaca creating an environment that is moderately visually intriguing.
  With characters that are fairly two-dimensional one would figure the star power involved would try to beat some life into the dull characters and flat screenplay. It is understandable that the characters are merely consequences of their environment but some of the dialog execution in regards to tone is painfully monotonous; on occasion Gattaca sounds like a script read-through. Ethan Hawke is his usual underplayed, slightly lethargic self and is happy to demonstrate that anyone could do his job as long as they are teen-dream material. Uma Thurman is effectively listless but oddly enough, has little sexual chemistry with Hawke even though they are married off screen. Jude Law is his usual scene-stealing self but gets very little screen time. I kept half wishing that he had played Hawkes role.
  The idea of use of DNA to create perfect children, or clone individuals is extremely interesting material, unfortunately it is trapped in an uninteresting movie. Gattaca tries so hard to illustrate a desolate engineered society that proper character development is neglected for a plethora of elementary DNA lessons that are largely dumb down for public consumption.",2.0

"I love intelligent sci-fi films, and so I watched Gattaca with high  expectations.  It wasn't terrible; in fact, to squeeze two stars out of me  says a lot.  But first let's look at the ""thriller"" plot every  other reviewer seems to applaud.  Who's kidding whom?  The heroine  deliberately plants a clue that would lead to the hero's arrest--the same  chap she's falling in love with.  Why?  I can't think of a single reason,  except to set up an artificial plot.  Later she's ""relieved"" that  our hero ""didn't do it.""  Well, by then I was hoping he had done  it; it would have at least justified her otherwise wholly irrational  attempt to frame him.  OK, so there's no plot here.  What else?  Characterization?  Hardly.  It's set up as a story between two brothers,  but the middle of the movie wanders around without addressing that story.  Only at the beginning and end do we see that it's a story about two  brothers who are rivals.  Big deal--it doesn't help the movie along.  I  think anyone who believes this is an ""intelligent"" sci-fi movie  must have viewed it with commercial interruptions throughout, because it  has the look and feel of a movie that only makes sense in short bites.  Maybe the commercials added to the futuristic quality of the movie.  (Some  future--although we have space travel, the people are still driving mid-90s  automobiles.  (Actually, it was a low budget film, so we can't expect much  in the way of realism.  But even in Woody Allen's low-budget  ""Sleeper,"" the transport vehicles were at least Cute.  Isn't it  strange that there are movies out there that are so underrated that they  have to become ""cult favorites"" before the mainline critics take  notice of them (and then adopt them as their own!), while there are some  movies--Gattaca is one of them--that for whatever reason was hugely  overrated.  Bottom line: it's not bad, you might enjoy it, and if you go in  expecting zero, you might be moderately surprised on the upside.",2.0

"Although I can enjoy stories of societies with plenty of rules, and obsessions with faddish luxuries, I found this film tedious, in spite of its visual beauty and sets that were apparently quite faithful to the period. Missing in action were the human beings who manage to make life interesting in spite of social constraints.

Before discussing the details, I must express my appreciation for Themis-Athena's well-written favorable review, which pays tribute to Edith Wharton's novel and defines its intent very well.

Two defects of the film are fatal enough to merit a cement burial. The conversation of the society is uniformly boring - primarily about possessions; fads including the sculpture of May's hands by an ""artist"" as kitchy as today's Kinkaid; empty gossip related to social rules. All this may be necessary to define the society, but there is too much of it and not enough real feeling to make the society human. By contrast, most films of ""Anna Karenina"" strike an acceptable balance between a formal society and its impassioned members. Yet the sets are beatifully realized, and the credits show that the set designer had the cooperation of Baccarat and Tiffany's. The second defect is Daniel Day-Lewis's performance. His mincing, quiet speech really annoyed me, and made it impossible for me to feel sympathy for his emotionally constipated character. To me, he sounded like a satirical immitation of John Malkovitch in ""Dangerous Liasons"" - which was released four years later, although Malkovitch as Valmont had bite. A more interesting directorial and scripting choice would have been to make Newland Archer more convincingly attracted to his wife May, so that there would be a stronger emotional conflict within him. As presented, his lack of interest in May made him seem more pointless, and not interesting enough to deserve the love of the more passionate Countess. If that was the best that New York high society had to offer, the Countess should have made an immediate U-turn for Europe.

Positive reviewers tried to defend the excessive use of narration - presumably with passages from the novel, but the narration in this film was much worse than it is in other films. The narrations were much too long, and therefore intruded on the actors. Second, actors sometimes repeated a line of the narration. I suppose the writers considered this to be cute, and might have been trying to play with the relationship between drama and life, as they did quite obviously by the use of operas and plays. Although a narration is sometimes a sign of laziness or frustration, I would consider this to be simply a failed effect.

In spite of the challenges of a script that constrained like a tight corset, there were some excellent performances. Wynona Ryder's appearance was perfect for her smallish part, and she was in many ways an exception to the general emotional shallowness of the film. While appearing to be innocent, her nuanced facieal expressions and body language as May showed how this story could be brought to life. It made her convincing as she executed extremely precise tactics in dealing with her husband's psyche, while playing by the rules of her society. Michelle Pfeiffer turned in an excellent performance as her cousin Ellen the Countess. Always interesting, and capable of acting very sexy, she measured her performance as apropriate to the part.  Some changes in the writing and in the directing of Day-Lewis could have improved her side of the triangle. Even the first scene at the opera didn't seem exactly right. Other reviewers have commented on several excellent performances in the minor roles, especially Miriam Margolies as a credible and human matriarch, and Stuart Wilson as a stereotypical unfaithful Victorian husband.

Although I felt the first three quarters of the film were difficult to enjoy, I found the plot turns in the last quarter to be interesting and amusing.  The epilogue, set twenty years after the main action of the story seemed to be an unnecessary waste of camera time.

The camera work was excellent, in my opinion. One reviewer complained about unusual angles, but I found them interesting and tasteful.

With a major restructuring of the characterizations, and greater humanity in the social scenes, and finer tuning of the emotional development, this story could be interesting, and would justify the expense of so many beautiful costumes and sets, enhanced by great camera work.",2.0

"Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence is so many things: witty, subtle, satirical, and tongue-in-cheek melodramatic, not to mention populated by deceptively complex characters. Martin Scorcese's adaption, unfortunately, is none of these.

A fan of both classic literature and costume dramas, I understand that there are always necessary changes that must be made when converting a book to film. However, when the entire tone and purpose of a work is changed, I have to object. Wharton's somewhat affectionate fun-poking at her New York society is completely drowned out by weepy music and over-the-top romance. Not even her own writing can save this movie, as evidenced by the stiff and misguided narration, which takes its passages directly from the book.

All in all, although beautiful, this adaptation is lazy and inconsistent.  The acting goes from extremely dramatic to completely flat, and I'm not convinced that anyone involved with this film really ""got"" Wharton's novel. After viewing it, I was baffled by the discrepencies between the glowing reviews and what I had just watched.

If you enjoyed the movie, but have not read the book, then I highly recommend it. The Age of Innocence is a wonderful American novel, and the story is told in a much more playful voice with more richly developed characters.",2.0
"The first wrong note comes with the opening credits, those silly roses and tulips blooming over and over and over in a time-lapse parody of abundance. What was initially pretty becomes tedious and rote. And while Miriam Margolyes has a few apt moments of mercilessly poking fun at her pretentious family (while colluding with them jovially), all the actors and most especially the director misunderstand every basic point of Wharton's brilliant, tragic novel.

To put it crudely, there are two basic truths to her story: 1) the rules of New York aristocratic society are stultifying, conservative and repressive. 2) May is the villain.

But Scorsese's camera engages in an endless orgy of materialistic consumption, one that celebrates rather than condemns the rewards of wealth. And to cast winsome, fey Ryder as the athletic, stolid and ploddingly dull May? She's supposed to be the woman Newland is virtually forced into marrying, the safe choice that has the stamp of destiny from all their friends. Not the magical, doomed creature he actually desires who appears unexpectedly in the person of the Countess. The Countess is a European evocation of values beyond those of his circle, and Pfeiffer does the best of the three in her thankless role; she at least looks beautiful and fragile.

However she's supposed to be that half-glimpsed dream he fails to realize, not the temptress intent on foiling his destiny with her witchy ways. Newland is to be pitied, and the ultimate sense is that true passion is the missed opportunity of his life. Instead we wonder how he could ever have been tempted to abandon the charming May, much less risk throwing away his assured future for such a meager prize. Which is an altogether different message than Wharton intended, and it leaves the film rather inert and confusing. The plot and the characters no longer match up.

It's ironic that Joanne Woodward provides so much lugubrious narration, as it seems the film-makers were as little interested in what she was saying as the audience would eventually be.",2.0
"Even though this was directed by Martin Scorsese, the film missed the book because the casting was all wrong.
If you loved the book you couldn't see Winona Rider as May.  May was tall and blonde and athletic looking with pale blue
eyes.  The Ellen character in the book is described as a small ""dark lady, pale and dark""  &"" with ""brown hair in close curls"" and
here's Michelle Pfeiffer in all her blonde abundance playing Ellen!  It bothered me a lot.  Daniel Day-Lewis was good as
Archer; and the last important scene was played very well but over all it was a disappointment.",2.0

If I had to pick ten ""classic"" books that do not enjoy the popularity they deserve, this book would certainly be one of them.

Now let me say a few good things about the film. First, the costumes and settings are excellent. I think it was the only thing really done well here, and maybe well enough to redeem the film if you are willing to watch it muted - which I recommend. Second, at least Winona Ryder can act.

Let's be frank: Scorsese, Pfeiffer and Day-Lewis had no business being associated with this film. Like the screenwriter, they do not seem at all to have understood that the dialogue is supposed to be subtle, to mean more than it says. Most of the innuendo of the book's dialogue is gone, and nothing worthwhile has taken its place. The narration is particularly bad. Meanwhile, the actors (excepting Ryder) throw themselves around melodramatically as if incapable of making small gestures seem important. People constantly lose their tempers. It's closer to Raging Bull with pretty furniture than to Wharton's The Age of Innocence.

Winona Ryder struggles to seem as innocent as May is supposed to seem, but she's the only person involved with this film who seems to have understood the story; she would surely have made an excellent Olenska. If I had the money, I think I would pay the movie to be re-made with her in that role.",2.0

"As the movie is based in the well-heeled society of New York City in the 1870s, you expect it to be a bit dry and formal. Unfortunately, the movie takes it to the extreme.

The bottom line theme is that this is a story of a forbidden love of sorts, suppressed by the propriety of the society they live in and the circumstance that finds the parties married to other people. What happens when you find your ""true love"" and it is not the person you are married to...in 1870s NYC...whoops. In modern times, you just get divorced I guess. But at the time, in those social circles, divorce was a taboo that would lead to being ostracized from all the hip parties (and possibly your family). Why that would be a hindrance to ""true love"" I don't know, but it was in this movie.

In any event, we get to watch the slow suffering of these estranged lovers over time, but Scorcese never quite hits the emotional vein that makes a tragedy of so long life really captivating to an audience. Unfortunately, Scorcese also takes 2 plus hours to tell us this simple story.

Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic per usual, one of the few bright spots. He really captured the essence of a ""proper"" man suffering greatly just underneath the surface. Michelle Pfeiffer is also good in her role, which Scorcese must have picked her for after a similar role in Dangerous Liaisons (a far superior movie). The rest of the cast were so-so, because the story and the movie were so-so.

"This movie is ridiculous beyong words.  To begin with, the plot might justify a brief hour and a half to 2 hour film, but nothing like this  15 hour (feels like it, really) snooze-fest.  It's very simple, and has been done thousands of times much better.  Two people fall in love but for some reason they can't get together or they wouldn't still be in love if they did (I only saw it two weeks ago and already I can't remember).  Then there is the dialogue, which is mostly schmaltzy and overly melodramatic, and is completely mangled by most of the actors.  Especially annoying is Joanne Woodwards voice-over narration, which chirps up whenever the music swells to tell you a) what just happened (which you know if you've been paying attention at all) b) what everyone's thinking about (which you know because most of the performances are so cartoonish) and c) what the fallout will be (which you don't need to know because they'll show you the scene about it later).  Daniel Day-Lewis looks grumpy most of the time, whereas Michelle Pfeiffer is suitably radiant, but says most of her lines in a breathless whisper with her eyes unfocused, gazing dreamily at the wall.  In the supporting cast, Scorcese has a miniature stable of British actors in near-cameos.  Unlike their American counterparts, they look comfortable and relaxed doing a period peice, but the dialect coach seems to have them all doing ridiculously exagerrated American accents.  Basically, had the Brits made this movie, it might have been a lot better, because they do enough costume dramas to know not to get caught up lingering on the pretty sets.

"Review of Absence of Malice
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

The premise is superbly intriguing: A man reads an article about himself in the newspaper one morning, which pretty much accuses him of murder. The movie, even with the likable and compelling lead Paul Newman, doesnt really deliver on its great intro.

Paul Newman isn't happy with the article, and he tracks down the journalist responsible, Sally Field. Im not really a Sally Field fan anyway, and this movie did nothing to change my opinion of her. I found her annoying, and it took all my strength to pretend to take her seriously. Since all my strength was used up, I had none left to focus on the plot, and with all the twists and turns, I got pretty confused. If you have no problem paying attention to who-said-what, whos-the-source, whos-after-who stories, and you don't mind Sally Field, youll have a better chance at liking Absence of Malice than I did.",2.0

Overall, I was let down by the whole thing. I remember TV shows of the day that came off better than Absence of Malice week after week. Case in point, The Rockford Files, Cannon, Columbo, Beretta, etc. I'll be selling my Blu-ray. I will revel in its ""absence"" from my collection.",2.0
"The violent circumstances of a Japanese family's death have given rise to a curse in which all who enter their old house are stalked and killed by demons representing the dead family. That's not much of a plot, which is why this isn't much of a movie. In scene after scene, we watch a hapless person bumble through an abandoned area, slowly coming to the realization that they are not alone. They all eventually succumb to the fear that envelopes them, and the demons manifest themselves in a variety of creepy ways before dispatching the bumblers. The production values are high, and the scenes are very creepy/scary/disturbing, which is saying something. But any attempt to inject reason or logic into viewing the movie bursts the bubble, and ultimately, there's just not enough to sustain a feature film.",2.0

"The rule of thumb for watching any Japanese horror film that is remade in Hollywood is to go for the original, subtitles be damned. The one exception is The Ring.

The Grudge remake, made by the exact same director of the original, is a series of confusing, disconnected creepy scenes until the end where you kinda-sorta get an explanation. No plot. Just typical stupid horror movie characters doing stupid things. ""Oh, let's go check out that really creepy sound all by myself after I found my wife/mother/girlfriend/pet dead.""

On a positive note, it did introduce the definitely creepy guttural ""groan"" that has since been over-used (the latest in the 2013 flick ""Mama"").

Having seen nearly all the Japanese horror flicks, there is a clear cultural fear of long black hair, water and eyeballs or mouths that are stretched/blacked out via CGI. When you experience it for the first time, it's scary. The second time, it's interesting. For the third, fourth, ...., it's yaaawwwwwnnnn.",2.0

"The Grudge had its share of jumpy moments and freakiness. But the actual story is somewhat dissapointing. People enter and house and get mysteriously killed off one by one. Ok, sounds interesting.

The premise is interesting, but it just didn't deliver.",2.0
"As the lights were put out in the apartment and the sweet smells of popcorn emminated from within, the friends all gathered on the floor and couches to finally watch 'The Grudge', all in Hi-Def and PG-13 so the studios can rack in the loot from the kiddie pools, and share moments of sheer terror with each other and rekindle old nostalgia reminiscent of Exorcist, Poltergeist or the like...

...a couple of chills
...a few laughs
...and how completely we were in agreement that Bill Pullman is one of the most wooden, phony, tangibly boring actors in the industry.

I don't recall if it was a Dimension Type Film Disaster, if it wasn't it certainly should have been. I mean I understand the idea behind it, but let's make it a little more non predictable. Oh boy at door, oh no shadow going by clouded window, oh my noises in house when no ones around, oh no look in attic... Leave house, go back to house, people dead in house, go back again to house, cops in house, cops that know about previous murders in house, head cop goes back to house, head cop dies in house, other cops go back to house, boyfriend goes to house, Michelle-untalented-Gellar goes to house again, but wait didn't she leave...yes, yes she left, but she isn't in THAT house, but she is, on the stairs but it's not the same house she went into, because she went back in time to the same house that isn't that house she went into originally because it's the house where the first murders took place which by all relative standards is that same house...(phew)

Some of the effects were pretty damn brilliant, [scary spectre thingy with tentacles in corner of room et all] but all in all, the masses who say this was scary as heck, is understandable, because you could easily be frightened, I guess. Fun, but not for me. A sure classic for the Myspace generation.

Scary: no
Fun: sure

"This film has everything I hate about horror. The manipulative music, the gross-outs, the suspense without the suspension of disbelief, and a lack of an Eternal Cosmic Truth bore me. In fact, most horror has the same message: ""Humans are powerless against evil.""

So we have this infidelity which leads to a curse, and the curse leads to ""random acts of violence.""  At its core, this is an infection story, similar to communicable vampirism, Night of the Living Dead, or the Borg's assimilation. Consequently, this is a treadmill, or rat-wheel plot: it goes round and round, but goes nowhere.  Buffy Michelle Geller can do nothing to stop the curse. Her best efforts are not enough.

Stylistically, however, it's all there. The lighting, framing, and composition are all there.  Retaining the original Japanese setting adds to the eeriness.

"If you haven't seen the movie - DONT

This film was bad enough to be bad, but not bad enough to be funny.  (except now whenever I burp...  If youve seen the movie you know what Im talking about.)

I probably should have seen the japanese version instead.  One of my co-workers suggested that this film had good cinematography - so I gave it a chance.  I cant say I was impressed.  Too dark for the small screen - I think I enjoyed one shot in the entire film.

the film was a mess.  It wasn't scary it was random.  theres no sense of build or suspense. Was the story non linear? Or did it have bad continuity?  Perhaps I lost interest and it just seemed to jump around.

There were some shots that seemed to reference carnival of souls - which was cool.  But that cheesey low budget film from 50 years ago was a much more masterful horror movie than the grudge.",2.0

"I couldn't really follow what was going on at first.  I finally figured out where I was supposed to follow the story about 3/4 of the way through the film.  A lot of scenes dragged on, and there were times I had to stop the DVD and say I'd come back later to finish.  Usually, when you have big name actors in a horror movie (Sarah Michelle Gellar is no Tom Hanks, but she is pretty well known), there's usually more of a fixation on the actor and less with the story of the movie. Some other good examples of this would be Scream (Nev Campbell, David Arquette, Drew Barrymore), I Know What You Did Last Summer (another with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Jennifer Love Hewitt), and House on Haunted Hill (Tey Diggs, Chris Kattan).  I do give two stars for the great cinematography. That's about it!",2.0
"I had all hopes for this movie and was stunned at how bad they managed to make it.  The only thing I could give a rating for was the special and very eerie visual effects, the rest spoilt what could have been a stunning horror.

The movie felt as though it was in bits.  There was no gradual build up, nor breaks inbetween to further build ups.  There was one scene after another of horror.  It lost impact almost from the word go when you realised that after one ""fast and obvious build up to the expected climax of horror"" there came another and another, one right after the other.  When you have constant climaxes, there is nothing more to watch.

I sat and watched a disjointed movie filled with ""scenes"".  They ruined the eerie parts by then overdoing it and not giving the viewer a chance to appreciate it and become drawn in.

I found myself at the end of the movie in a state of shock thinking ""is this it??"".  What potential, yet what a disaster!!!  And I am not hard to please.  I am a horror fan and can appreciate even the stupid ones, but this was a movie that should have been real impact stuff, designed to be serious and designed to shock, but again lost all impact.

The scenes shold have been more realistic and slowly built up to, and spaced further apart, with little eerie things inbetween.  They ALMOST did it a few times, but wham, once again the over the top and fast climax and then onto the next one.

Unfortuantely, now that they have such special effects, they rely on those to make the movie and the movie ends up being crap.",2.0
"This was not very good, in my opinion. The Ring scared the bejeezus outta me. This was not scary.

"I don't have a problem with movies employing non-linear narratives--Memento and The Limey do this very well.  The Grudge fails not because of the narrative structure, but because we never settle on whose story this is.  It is distributed too thinly among too many characters.  Despite the fact that Gellar gets top billing, it doesn't seem to be any more her story than any of the other characters.

Still, there are some effective images (and sounds!)--they would be very much more effective, though, if the writer had allowed us to develop a connection with the characters.",2.0
"I had watched Ju-On The Grudge, the original japanese version, and I was creeped out by it.

"The Grudge was an okay movie, one of those ones that just barely holds your interest enough to make you want to finish it. It's also one of those movies that is hard to describe the plot without giving spoilers, because it jumps back and forth through time, making it next to impossible to follow in a logical sequence.

There weren't any real surprises-- plenty of people following the old dictum of going through ""That Door""-- you know the one where everyone in the theater shouts, ""Don't go through that door!"" The people also climbed stairs and went into dark rooms without turning on lights-- plenty of people just begging to be victims.

This would probably be a good date movie to watch at the drive-in theater but watching it on the home DVD player just didn't deliver the expected chills and thrills.",2.0

"Although I didn't find The Ring terrifying, this movie  surely isn't terrifying at all. But I guess you can't expect much horror in a PG-13 rated movie. It has also been compared to the movie 28 Days Later which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar tries to give a shocking performance in this movie but fails terribly. She moves to Tokyo to continue her nursing career and learns about mysterious deaths and she tries to find the source of the deaths. All I can remember about this film is the stupid looking child who once he opens his mouth and you are witness to it, you die. We find out the child is a ghost who died a terrible death and now is seeking revenge. No blood, no gore, not scary and overall disappointing. I hope they don't plan to make The Grudge 2.

"The Grudge, based on a Japanese horror film, involves a haunted house that seems to destroy everything it touches and the lives of Americans living in Japan. It's off to a bad start from the begining when it fails to explain how these characters came about to living in Japan and just gives them titles like exchange student and Professor. I happen to know for a fact that Japan is one of the homogenous countries in the world, which is just a way of saying very few non-Japanese people live there. Also the Japanese characters, seemingly few for a movie set in Japan, all talk in perfect english. Well people don't see this kind of movie for an insight into Japanese culture anyway.

Apparently we learn that the haunted house the movie center's around once had a family that was murdered in it (and they fail to tell the American family moving in, yeah right). There's also a professor who in the past had encountered the house and surcomed to his death because of it. Sarah Michelle Geller's character encounters this house, finds it's not an ordinary house, and investigates. Trust me I'm giving nothing away; even if I wanted to it would be impossible for me to explain the major plot points. There are visual sequences that could very well have been effective had the story made any sense what so ever. Simply put this film is one scene after another of a noise, or an image, or a phenoma without the slightest bit of coherence to a plot. It's riddled with inconsistancies and there's a flashback sequence as uncomprehesible as anything else in this film. There's also no character developement, which might be the least of it's problems.

Judging by my writing so far I should give it just one star, but I hesitate due to the visual nature. As I said there are scenes that could be effective in a better story. It does have a sense of creepiness, though I really was never scared. I can compare this to The Ring, another visually strong film, but one that was actually going somewhere, and was intrigueing, and yes was actually frieghtening. The Grudge plays us like a yo-yo, yanking us again and again without purpose, and in the end we're lost in comprehension.",2.0
"I like the Japanese Version (Ju-on) more.  Now, the hollywood producers are running out of ideas and have to borrow (or buy) ideas from other foreign markets and re-produce it to fit the American audiences.  The funny thing is:  American audiences seem to like it and do find it fresh.  Personally, I do find it boring and predictable, not something new or interesting.  I have seen them all.  Not much for me to say about this film.  How come people can give such a long review!?!?!?  Huh?

Honestly, I DON'T find them scary at all.",2.0
"Hollywood are rapidly running out of ideas when it comes to new films, and have been remaking Japanese films. This one is all too similar to The Ring, but has some pretty good jump scenes in it. But it's instantly forgettable, and Sarah Michelle Gellar just does not work. It's ridiculous that regular people can't go see the original versions of films, they probably would more, if Hollywood wasn't so determined to remake films, and put American actors in just to make it more viewer friendly. What utter nonsense.

The only good thing about this film was the little boy who appears. He is so creepy. I jumped so many times, he's a talented actor for someone so young, and can show so much with just his eyes. It's also very well edited, and is quick enough to make you think ""did I just see that?""

There's too many of your usual horror movie cliches in this, including looking for something in an attic with only a lighter to light your way and a character following another character that shouldn't or isn't there in the first place. There's also no character development, and it took me a wee while to work out why the character had done what he did in the first place. In fact, I'm still not sure what happened. Most of the characters are severely underused, Bill Pullman & Clea Duvall being the main two, and instead all the focus is on Sarah Michelle Gellar. Who just doesn't work in this kinda role. I know she appeared in many episodes of Buffy, but I've never seen it, so I can't compare. There just wasn't something right. Her face was also very distracting, there's something NOT right with her nose. It's almost like she's been under the knife, cos I don't remember her nose being like that!

The timeline just doesn't make any sense to me, there's a couple of different storylines happening, which are linked, but one storyline is going forwards in time, and another is going backwards. Get your head around that one if you will.

This isn't an enjoyable film. It starts off with a apparently unexplained suicide, and then carries on. Just pay attention, and be freaked out.",2.0
"Usually I am not the kind of person who enjoys horror movies but sometimes you just feel like having a good scare.
A friend of mine came over one evening and we rented 'the Grude', We were all set. We turned of all the lights, lit a few candles, had all the stuff we needed in hand reach and started the movie.
We waited, and waited......and waited some more but no scary things happened. We were terribly disappointed. It was nothing like we had expected. It had an occasional scare but not the ones that give you a racing heart.
My advice for people who want to see this movie would be; rent another one!",2.0
"Supposedly the story of an American nurse living in a haunted house in Tokyo where she is exposed to a mysterious curse that locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming their life and spreading to another victim. Well, that story line is so hard to follow in this nonesensical jump-out-of-the-dark scare 'em up that I don't even know myself why I started the review that way.

Let me start again: This is a movie that has Buffy the Vampire Slayer and a lot of scary images that literally pop out at the viewers with a loud, bassy BONG. The story line is hard to follow, and after watching I had to read the back of the DVD case to see what this flick was supposed to be about.

There...that's a better start to the review. And a good way to end it. Don't buy this; rent it if you must (or catch it on cable), but don't say I didn't warn you.

Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing. The only thing remotely scary about this movie is the sound the thing makes, now that was creepy. Watch it if you want, but don't say I didn't warn you.

"Sarah Michelle Gellar (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) plays Katherine, a woman who is now taking care of a what looks like a sick woman, played by Grace Zabriskie (R.S.V.P.) Now, as Gellar is putting the woman to sleep, something comes up to the side of her and shocks the hell out of her...it looks like a japanese girl..floating. Then, we get into flashbacks of when the old woman (Zabriskie) bought the house with her daughter, played by Clea DuVall (Identity) and her daughter's husband played by William Mapother (Tv's LOST). Also, Gellar finds out about a man named Peter, played by Bill Pullman (Zero Effect), as she experiences a flashback of him and finds out the secret to why this woman has such a grudge against the people. You either dig it or you dont, is my saying and I dug it to a certain point where it kinda went downhill from there. Director Takashi Shimizu rewrote this story Ju-On: The Grudge which has a lot more effective and better then this one...this one is the neutered hollywood version. Gellar costar's with actor Jason Behr (Tv's Roswell) who worked with her on one episode of Buffy, surprisingly as one of her ex-boyfriends in that episode...here, he plays her boyfriend who goes threw the grudging pains, as I like to call it. Some stuff is creepy, other stuff is kinda gets annoying like the cat meows and the rasping voice on the telephone...even the girl kinda reminds me of the girl from The Ring which blows it off, but she's a Japanese girl...I don't know, maybe the girl from The Ring and the girl from The Grudge should make a movie called Ring Girl and Grudge Girl Take A Holiday. Also starring Ted Raimi (Man with the Screming Brain), who's brother Sam Raimi (Spider-Man 1 and 2) executive produced the film. Also, Director Shimizu casts most of the actors from the Japanese movie as well.",2.0
"The Evil Dead team of Sam ""Spider-Man"" Raimi and producer Bob Tapert helped bring this American adaptation of Takashi Shimizu's Ju-On: The Grudge to life; only it's more stripped down and accessable for American audiences who gushed over the Ring (which began this whole new horror fad of re-making Japanese horror films that are rated PG-13).  The Grudge begins promisingly enough with Bill Pullman and a surprising turn of events, before introducing Sarah Michelle Gellar, in her first post-Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie that doesn't feature a computer animated talking dog, as a young American woman in Tokyo with her boyfriend (Roswell's Jason Behr).  Since the girl who usually watches an inept woman is missing, she gets the duty, and soon enough, plenty of spooky things are happening in this house, and the film shifts back and forth revealing the story of what happened.  As a previous reviewer stated, the Grudge is more of an intriguing production that a great horror film, with clever camera tricks substituting for CGI-animated ghosts and spectres.  However, the film is predictable to it's very end, and even though Shimizu is in the driver's seat once again, it's surprising how much this Americanized version fails in comparison to the original.  It's not half as creepy as it thinks it is, and despite a solid performance from Gellar, it's hard seeing her as a helpless damsal after years of watching her kick vampire behind.  In the end, the Grudge is a disappointing mainstream, teen-aimed thriller that fails to deliver, and while this ""unrated"" director's cut includes some more graphic footage, it's still worth avoiding for long time horror fans.",2.0
"I suppose I could give this move a better rating if it made sense.  But basically it is just a compilation of creepy moments to make people jump, that's all.  Speaking of jumping this movie jumps and bounces around like a check from Delta Airlines.  I had no idea what was going on, except for the fact that something terrible happened to two people in this house a long time ago and now they are pissed off and became Scary Eyed Cripple Woman and her sidekick Cat-Boy.

Just when I think I am beginning to understand what is going on, another wrench is thrown in the mix making me realize that I don't know what the hell is going on.  The characters and acting in this movie are pretty bad, but I must admit not horrible.  I was about to fall asleep on this movie on several occasions, however the writers must have known when people are about to fall asleep then they bring out a scary scene to make you jump and keep you awake.

The only thing this movie accomplished is that it did keep me watching it for the entire movie, but in hindsight, I can't believe I was able to sit through this.  While I admit this movie did scare me in a few places, I was VERY disappointed at the ending....IT MADE NO SENSE!  It reminded me off the old horror movies from my teenage years that always would leave you hanging.

If you want to be scared then you definitely will be in this movie, but as far as being a genuine horror movie, you are looking the WRONG place!  It has some very good scary moments, but it's too bad there is not a story line to go along with it.",2.0
"At exactly 17 minutes and 45 seconds into ""The Grudge,"" the ever-reliable cat jumps out of a closet and scares somebody.  I tell you this only so that you will know when you will be able to take a quick refreshment and/or restroom break and not miss anything.  It also pretty much underscores the modus operandi of this film, which is ""don't bother with something new when something old will do.""  For although ""The Grudge"" is a remake of a recent Japanese film (""Ju-On,"" made by the same director, Takashi Shimizu), there really isn't anything here that we haven't seen hundreds of times before in haunted house movies made east of the International Date Line.

The bland Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a young foreign exchange student living in Japan who volunteers as a care worker in her spare time.  When she is sent to the home of a strangely ""lethargic"" woman, Gellar begins to suspect that there is something not quite right about the residence.  From then on, she and several other people, who also share a connection with the house, are haunted by a ghoulish specter who keeps popping up in the strangest places and at the most inopportune moments to exact her revenge for being done away with in an untimely manner (although none of the people she pesters had anything to do with her demise).

Although there are a few mildly suspenseful moments scattered throughout the film, ""The Grudge"" is simply too derivative and too hackneyed to register much of an impact on our psyches, with a great deal of its imagery ripped-off from that seminal horror film ""Carnival of Souls.""  The story makes very little sense when you start to analyze it seriously and, after all the huffing and puffing to arrive at a stunning climax, the ending deflates like a slowly leaking balloon.  I haven't seen the original version, so I have no idea how it compares to this one.  But I can hardly imagine it was anywhere near as undistinguished and lackluster as this one is (or else why remake it?).  Even with the same director at the controls, perhaps something simply got lost in the translation.",2.0

There are no scenes of blood and guts in the original but Hollywood felt compelled to add them for the remake. WHY?? Blood and Guts do NOT make a horror movie!

If you want a scary movie, Get the original Ju-On. They are ofcourse very similar but Ju-On will have you pulling the blanket over your eyes and pulling the covers far back before you go to sleep.

Of course the house has some history, the usual death and messed up people.

The ghost of a woman comes back and haunts the living heck out of the characters in this movie.

The only problem was it wasn't scary.

There was this gutteral sound that the ghost woman made, which was a little eerie, but not enough to give someone nightmares...or the creeps at all.

I gave it two stars because the Japanese come up with some wicked cool scary movies!

"This movie is like the ring to me. Both were unninteresting and not scary. Besides the shining and certain exceptions, I usually don't get scared during unrealistic horror movies. This one isn't scary, and tries to scare you by randomly showing someone's eye on the screen. That's not what I call scary. The plot centers around a haunted house in Japan, and everyone that enters this house shall die. This is due to some curse and of course when Sarah Michelle Gellar goes inside it, she's got to find a way to save herself. And of course, her boyfriend wants to die too so he goes in also. Just like the boyfriend in the ring. The movie isn't particullarily scart, and if you dissliked the ring like me, you won't like this. But if you liked it, you'll love it. Oh, and by the way, the little boy that makes cat noises (Meowwwww) isn't scary! That's got to be the stupidest thing ever! I found myself laughing every time he'd Meow.

There are some decent jump scares throughout, but other than that it's pretty much your standard haunted house story. Except this one's set in Japan, a choice which I cannot understand at all. It made all those gaijins stick out like sore thumbs and I kept wondering what Ted Raimi was doing in Japan.

The writing was sophomoric, the acting was uninspired and the direction felt like a Japanese director doing an American version of his original Japanese story. It ended being the cinematic equivalent of Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

Not only is the story line played out, but it is also terrible. Not enough plot points, extremely hard to follow, and no this has nothing to do with people being or not being ""sharp"". Casting an actor like Sarah Michelle takes away from the overall realism of the movie. Good actor? Yes, but any true horror fan knows that more or less unkown actors only add to the experience by adding realism to the film. Casting a-list actors in horror films comes only as a distraction in my opinion. I tend to stray from horror films set in different countries as they tend to include languages that both the audience and often times the actors cant understand. Overall this is just a sad horror movie. Terrible story line, Mediocre acting, and lots of people speaking some sort of foreign language. I'm not even sure if this film deserves so much as two stars, as it is in many ways a pathetic film. Do not buy this movie for any reason, rent it if you must, becasue after all, this is just my opinion of the film.",2.0
"It's predictable, no great story, and just plain boring- I fell asleep every time I tried to watch it, and then this morning I got it out and made myself stay awake to watch it- I should of slept- my dreams have better plots to them...

I give it 2 stars just because I got some much needed sleep...Buy this movie if your having trouble catching some zzzzzzsss...",2.0
"First of all, to clarify any bad blood later, I am NOT a fan of scary movies. I find them, well...Um, scary. But of course, like most people, I am stupid and somehow allowed my friends to persuade me to watch it. The plot begins like most over used scary movie plots. Haunted house, has bad juju. No one wants to live in it because of some horrible grisly murder or double murder or triple murder, yada yada yada. But, instead of the usual stupid young family wanting to move in (""oh, honey wouldn't this be a great house for the kids?""), it's a...caretaker. I thought that was a cool twist, I admit. She's assigned to watch over the scary as all out house and it's mute, haunted occupant, an old lady.

But then that's when it starts getting confusing AND very very very scary. Mother of god scary.

First, the confusing stuff: I didn't understand the flashbacks. They confused me, and didn't help me understand why the croaky lady and the meowing boy were killing people. It didn't make sense to my tiny, innocent little brain. But, hey, that's me. But the flashbacks were really confusing. It didn't help me understand why the strange things were going on. Not at all.

Now, to the scary stuff. Oh my god! Scary scary scary scary! Scary to the point I think I coulda peed my pants. (Then again, I'm NOT a scary movie fan.) The croaking lady, for starters. We are introduced to her in shadow in the beginning of the movie, as she snatches up a past caretaker and does something to the woman that leaves her dead. Then, the meowing boy. We are introduced to him a little while later, making the horrendous (and creepy) yowl that I thought only my cat could make if I didn't let her outside. And then the telephone call. Eeeek! Creepy as hell.

Okay....I'm gonna stop now because I could go on forever about the scary stuff. It sums down to this: The American remake, while very disturbing and scary, tries too hard and falls very short without giving an explanation as to WHY the things happen to the occupants of the house like they do. So it's this: If you like a truly terrifying movie without much plot, stop here. If you want a scary movie with an intricate, good plot, move on.",2.0

"It took me like, 3 days to finally watch the whole movie.  I kept falling asleep or would just shut it down due to boredome.  The story was contrived and dull, it seemed like they just wanted to make a ""Ring""-type movie, hoping they could bank off it.  The special effects were totally subpar and this film was NOT scary!!!!!!!!  It was actually funny.  I burst out laughing when the creepy crawly ghost thingies made ""scary"" noises. I can picture the filmakers getting all excited and caught up ""Yeah! this will get 'em, that's sure to freak 'em out!""  NOT. Instead of being disturbing, the frog like groans reminded me of a 10 year old trying to annoy his parents.  Totally lame!  Nothing could save this movie.",2.0
"Maybe I shouldn't have watched the Japanese version, ""Ju-On"" upon which this movie was remade. I thought the foreign version was greatly over-rated by fans who were determined to be scared no matter what was thrown upon the screen. In the American version, I saw the identical ""scare"" moments which didn't chill me at all. I was shocked by Sarah Michelle Geller's appearance. She looked exhausted through the entire movie and exuded very little energy. As for the ghost boy, he looked like a kid who had gotten into a bag of flour and covered his face with it. And then somebody came along and plastered mascara around his eyes. Was this supposed to be one of the scenes where you jumped out of your seat? In the ""Making of..."" documentary, the film-makers seemed proud of having not made a linear movie--that is, ""The Grudge"" dips into the future, then the past, then the present. To me, it was confusing and style overpowered the effectiveness of this movie. The same Japanese director who made the foreign version of ""The Grudge"" was hired to make this Americanized production. That was a major mistake right there. Don't throw rotten tomatoes at me when I say this but American directors are unsurpassed when it comes to delivering the chills and thrills that we love.",2.0
"The previews for this movie looked like it would be a good one, but I was very disappointed.  It was slightly boring and just when you thought something unexpected would happen, not much did.

"When my family decided to see the movie The Grudge, I was totally stoked. The previews seemed awesome and I totally looked foward seeing it. After the first half hour I was bored. It was an extremely dull movie with a simple, simple story line thrown in with special affects and loud music. One thing I hated with the movie was that it jumped around showing the different affects that the grudge affected all of the characters. I'm sure that the japenese movie is highly more eventful then dull 1 hour and 45 minutes was. It was truly a waste of $7.00 (canadian).",2.0
"This movie wasn't bad.  I had scary moments.  But overall it made no sense.  It's like the girl from the Ring gets up, walks around, scares people, the end.  No real reason for killing people, no method, no back story, hardly a front story really.  It's over and you're thinking ""Why did any of this happen?""  Also it seems they ran out of money as the movie ends in the space of about 5 minutes.",2.0
"""The Grudge"" is based on the Japanese hit, ""Ju On,"" which I viewed a few months before watching this film.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen Davis, an American student who works for some kind of social work agency - the details are never really apparent.  When one of her colleagues fails to show up for work, Gellar is sent to care for an elderly patient.  Upon arriving at the home, Gellar finds a creepy boy (Toshio) locked in the closet, which sets into action the main plot.

I'm definitely not opposed to foreign films being remade for the American market; however, they seldom live up to the original, as is the case with ""The Grudge.""  The film retains many of the original elements, including the Tokyo locale, director Takashi Shimizu, several Japanese stars, and the basic story.  Interestingly, much of the background story has changed, which makes the plot more linear and comprehensible.  However, the result is a story that is much more obvious and devoid of suspense.  What played as mystical and creepy in the original film with Japanese actors sometimes seems semi-laughable when Gellar or Bill Pullman are inserted into the action.  I'm not a Buffy fan, but I couldn't help but think that Gellar should kick the specter into next year.

I wasn't a big fan of ""Ju On,"" but it did have creepy atmosphere that's missing from ""The Grudge.""  Thus, I can't recommend the remake.",2.0
"The cover looks cool and scary so I must warn you.  You CANNOT trust a book or DVD by its cover!!  I'm serious, I do not understand why this movie was supposed to be scary.  I felt like been there done that a million times before.  This movie, despite a strong cast, just didn't do it for me.",2.0
"I went to the movies to see this and I wish I hadn't wasted the money. It was not scary and it was rather bizarre...

Sarah Michelle Gellar is a type of house call nurse who is living in Tokyo with her boyfriend. She is asigned a particular womans home when the regular visiting nurse doesn't show up to work ( we see what happened to her in the beginning)... basically when she gets to the house weird things happen... a freakish child appears and noises and other weird things happen... even when she leaves she is haunted by this mysterious thing... and Sarah Michelle is determined to find out what is going on...

I guess its like when someone dies violently there is rage left behind in the place where they were killed and Sarah Michelle finds out what happened in the house to make it haunted...

I don't want to give things away in case you decide to actually see it for yourself... but I would skip it. It's not scary, it's odd, the story isn't even good, and the talent is at mediocre best.

I was utterly dissappointed in this film and do not recommend it.",2.0
This movie was a big disappointment. I should have learned my lesson years ago that I should ignore the critics and pay attention to moviegoers reviews on online sites. This movie has about two pages of plot which is dragged out for a full length movie. It isn't scary. The creepy atmosphere gets tedious as the plot doesn't move along. The supposedly scary moments are old hat and just get boring with repetition. A loser.,2.0
"I mean that this movie is not unlike the average horror movie you encounter within your lifetime: Scary sound and visual effects, Bad acting, Bad and predictable plot, deathrate of the main characters is between 80 to 100 percent etc...

Some people never learn. The creators of this movie seem to have cared more of the income they made at the movies.

This movie has a great (looking) cast, but that's it. They are from teen tv shows like Roswell, Xena and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. However there is no room for them to even say a one decent clever dialogue. The only thing they are good for are either looking stupid or scared and finally dying. I loved Bill Pullmans acting in Zero Effect and I thought that he would do a great job in this movie as well. Nope. I never once cared for any of the characters, They die They live Just the same to me. The actors probably took the job because it was easy: Five minutes of talking at maximum and lots of money to expect, except for learning how to pronounce the japanese word ""Konnichiwa"" of course.

My recommendation is that you go and see other better and new horror movies like Saw or Dawn of the Dead if you haven't seen them already.

To the big question: Is it scary? Well... It is quiet for a while and an actress sees a dark room, she's thinking ""What's that?"". With white stupid eyes she goes in to the room and slowly looks around... *footsteps can be heard from behind*... ""Who is it?""... *gulp*... She turns around... *footsteps stop*... and ... Slowly... Slowly... Again Slowly... sees... AAAAAARRRRRRGHHHHHHHH

When I read about the movie, it sounded promising:  young American woman residing in Japan with her boyfriend. She is temporarily assigned to be a caretaker for a woman with severe sleeping conditions.  The house is plagued by the presence of murderous ghosts, the result of a curse. The curse is born from someone dying in a powerful rage.  Seemed interesting enough but I was wrong.  It's almost as if there should have been a prequel to this movie.  I don't even know if I'd recommend it or not... I'm still confused.",2.0
"Why is it the Spotlight Reviews here usually heap praise on whatever they review?  Could it be because they are more insightful than the other reviews?  Nah...just look at the above reviews for The Grudge.  Could it be because Amazon wants you to think the reviewed item is worthy, and you should buy it?  Hmmm....

Anyway, The Grudge is worth viewing once, but it doesn't hold up much beyond that.  There are no surprises here; the ""secret"" to the plot is given away in the very beginning.  The scary moments are purely manipulative and stereotypical.  You know, a loud noise here, a blast of suspenseful music there.  The only thing I liked about this movie was the cast, which included some decent actors.  KayDee Strickland in particular seems to have a career ahead of her.  I'm a big Buffy fan, but Sarah Michelle Gellar pretty much sleepwalks through this movie.  She doesn't really seem to care what is going on, and I felt the same.

"When I went into the theaters to expect a frighteneing horror film, the only thing that my mind could receive from the torment for 2 hours was that the movie was too perdictable. Everytime at every scene that had someone alone you knew something was going to pop up and kill the person. I just got sick of seeing things pop up after every scene. I didn't even have a second to figure out the story line because i was interupted every 8 seconds because something new would pop out. That stupid little girl that had some broncitus or throat disease got on my nerves within eight minutes of the film, and the little kid in the movie was nothing but a disturbed little boy who needed much attention. If i were you, who ever is reading this or wants to see this movie, i recommend you rent it and decide on your own. i was disaspointed becuase it was presented as a Pathetic Teen Movie. If you thought American Pie is your favorite movie which is pathetic than you will think this movie is your god, because thats how horrible and  mediocre this film is. Its boring, and it lacks orginality. The girl constantly killing people at will gave me the impression that the filmmakers wanted to make a film out of the life story of Aileen Wuornos, that girl in the movie ""Monster"". But this time she just kills random people because they set there foot in her doorway.....lame...... I expected better from Sam Riami. Yet he is still a good director and this is just one of his flops. Well every director has at least one flop on their resume, excpet for Martin Scorcese. I would say not one of his films are a flop.

Instead a girl with make up which looks more real was protraying the whatever girl she is. i just call her the evil girl........",2.0
"What is it with remakes lately? Is Hollywood completely out of fresh new ideas? True, we get a good remake once in a while (Dawn of the Dead being a very good one, The Ring being a decent one), but more often than not, the films are just badly done. Especially when remaking good asian horror flicks.

Not that the original Grudge was all that great. But at least that one displayed a few very memorable scares. This new remake, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as a nurse working for a family in Tokyo in a house that just happens to be haunted, offers no scare, no thrills. No images that will come back to haunt your dreams. No silly jumps or scare. Nothing.

It's hard to see such a good cast trapped in such a horridly boring flick. We've come to expect much more of young actors like Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr and Clea DuVall. This cast had a great potential. So why does the movie fizzle like it does?

Well, a lot has to do with the film's structure. True, it's fun to catch a flick that does not have a linear structure, but such a movie needs to be well planned and thought out. The Grudge is so disjointed and so freely moves back and forth in time that it becomes a headache for the viewer. And the fact that every new section is seperated by a few seconds of darkness ruins whatever suspense had been built up to that point.

I was expecting much more from The Grudge, especially when considering the people involved in front and behind the camera (Sam Raimi being one of the producers). The movie is just long-winded and badly constructed. Let's hope that the next hoard of remakes coming our way will be better than this one!",2.0
"This is a movie about two little ghosts who burp at you until you kill yourself or fall into a coma or lose your jaw so that your tongue hangs down like a necktie.

Little Brother ghost and Little Sister ghost (actually Mommy Ghost but who cares?) are the victims of a murder-suicide. This fact is obscured by the much more pungent fact that they are victims of Genre. The director's insulated obsession with horror films has him forcing the Sibling Spooks to burp their way across town, up elevator shafts, down stairwells, through cell phones and even once in the window reflection of a public transit vehicle.

Their bad manners are not the only shenanigans the poor devils are forced to perform. They are both made to alternate between ""hiding under the bed"" and ""hiding in the attic"" - both being locations in which their prey never fail to fatally discover them. They are forced to wear large amounts of eyeliner and white foundation which they must remove and reapply instantly - and Spooky Sis is required to keep her hair carefully covering her face and to move with jerky motions in order to imitate the director's favorite spook from a different movie - The Ring.

Even though Sis can turn herself into smoke she is still forced to crawl downstairs - because... well because crawling is spookier than walking. I guess. Also, they both have a thing for ""opening their eyes *suddenly*."" Sis is also known for manipulating the electric circuitry of an apartment surveillance camera. Their only handicap - like a cat forced to wear a bell around its neck our two mini-spooks are required to gastro-intestinally announce their approach upon their victims. This gives the victims time to be ""horrified"" before their jaw falls off or they go catatonic.

The director's task was to take this entire situation and make it scary - no easy feat considering how goofy it is. The Genre Beast forces our director to replace substance with style: film coloring, ""spooky"" soundtrack music, a pseudo-intellectual achronological sequence and stupid flat characters who walk backwards into haunted rooms.

Being an American remake DVD release allows fans to say things like ""It wasn't as good as Ju-on!"" or ""Wait until the unedited directors cut comes out!"" and other booby-prize slogans (which, incidentally, obtain their purchase by referencing the same external  environment upon which this review is based and for which this review will be criticized.) Viewers whose horror-film expectations have been groomed by decades of incestual inter-genre self-referencing may find something good in The Grudge. Who knows?",2.0
I had great expectations for this film but was sorely disappointed. The story jumps time periods frantically that you never really get attached to the plot. The story is also a bit vague. The actors are poorly cast (sorry SMG) with Grace Zabriskie giving the only inspiring performance (as per usual) as a bed ridden invalid...and that ain't saying much. What was up with the frog noises? How did all these Americans end up in Japan and find such bad luck? The film requires an extreme suspension of disbelief that just leaves the viewer bored.,2.0
"This was pretty bad - I have to be more than a little irritated to take the time to write a review.  First, the thing was in the model of a greek trajedy. It was just a series of bad things happening. It did not seem to matter if the characters were courageous or ingenious. It did not matter if they ran from the problems or faced them - there was no hope.

Second - the flashbacks were badly done - it was never clear whether you were looking at past or present, and the plot was a hairball.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",2.0
"There was nothing worth noting in this film, and no reason to go out of your way to see it.

In order for a horror movie to work it needs at least one of the following:
1) Actual scares.
2) Gore/interesting deaths.
3) Characters you either fear for or identify with.
4) Interesting sets.
5) Tension regarding whether a character lives or dies.

This film had none of the above. There were no scares. There was no gore. The characters had no depth and no personality. The set was a typical Japanese home with no character.  There was no tension, as you could flawlessly predict whether someone would live or die.  Never once did you feel tension towards their outcome, and never did you care, as they were cardboard, anyway.

The movie begins with promise. The colors and angles will feel familiar if you saw the Ring, but it begins with promise, giving a mysterious death and a very creepy child.

It doesn't last, though. You soon realize that the deaths happen off camera and are usually unexplained. You realize the main ghost is a very confused looking Japanese woman with a facial expression that is supposed to be terror but is so over the top it's pure humor. And you'll realize the characters have no purpose other than to die. None of them say anything interesting, none have any unique characteristics. You could take the lines from one mouth and put them in another without noticing.

*minor spoiler* The end is terrible, too. The ghost gets a character face to face, inches away, but saves the character instead of killing the character. Of course, this doesn't stop the ghost from stalking the character and giving the ""surprise"" in the end. Why didn't it just kill the character when it had the chance? *end spoiler*

"I will make it quick ,clear and simple.

First I'm a big horror fan and I mean all kind of horror movies.

I wanted to like this movie, because i've seen Ju-On in a festival 2 years ago and it was weak. I mean, a kid with a cheap white make-up, weak storyline and pace, very boring. And please stop to compare it to The Ring or Ringu.(These 2 movies are good exemple of great horror movies)

And The Remake, yes the remake, just a little better cheap white make-up. Directed by the same guy, it'S almost the same movie, it'S in the same house, same kid,same story, same pace, but for this time, good special effects. Not even close to the Ring, that was a scary and very well directed movie,+ great visuals.

And for the acting? We can say it'S okay.

To be honest, I don't really understand why so much peoples find this movie very scary, like the scariest they've seen in years. The only creepy and good moment of the film is at the end, the scene in the stairs. (won'T spoil it)

People, wait for The ring 2, because if it'S good as Ringu 2 (I've seen it couple years ago in a festival) that'S gonna be scary!",2.0

"The documentary is worth watching for the pictures and some keeping the storyline in order. However I think it was an accident as they had no plan when they made this documentary on how to make a documentary.

We have several people that never talked to each other with completely different concepts of Dante. This would not be so bad in its self but the thread keep jumping from one quasi-authority to another. Most of the time they were talking about separate levels of heaven and hell; so you went up and down like a yo-yo.

"I am a big fan of Akira Kurosawa movies. Mifune, as admitted  by Kurosawa himself in public, is a big part of Kurosawa's magic. So I picked this movie to see Mifune working with another director. Well Kurosawa work is a pretty high bar and this movie is not even close. I had to give up after 1.5h of watching.  The reviews talked about beautiful cinematography and gripping story keeping you on the edge of the couch.

For me ""Gripping"" story was seriously undermined by many historically inaccurate aspects, some bordering on plain silly. Consider this: the movie is set in year 1600 AD. At this time Japan just went through what is known as ""100 years of war"". A historic civil strife which decimated Japan's population and ruined its economy. According to this movie it somehow strengthened feudal Japan's postal service. Because peasants and bandits send and promptly receive letters. Apparently all peasants are literate and are masters of calligraphy.
Important peasant characters run around wearing exquisite silk robes which Paris Hilton would not mind wearing. The robes stay spotless no matter how many times (a lot, do not even try counting) the character gets knocked to the ground.
Sword-fighting scenes are mediocre at best. Director creates a notion that an amateur swordsman with a *wooden"" sword routinely facing dozens of men armed with real swords and spears, comes out without a scratch. This is absurd. Check out Kurosawa sword scenes.
Apparently Musashi, the greatest swordsman of all times, is a wussy. Yes, he cries a lot in this movie.

Cinematography: There are lots of hilly country shots in the movie (often very dark). But they do not quite jell with the story so effect is lost. A lot of the movie is shot against very dark background. Director was definitely trying to to tell us something by constantly putting his characters into almost complete darkness. I do not know what director's message is but I have 2 ideas:
1. Movie producers saved BIG on sets and decorations
2. It is an artistic expression of rural Japan longing for electricity.

I can go on. For example in the scene of battle Musashi goes berserk despite his side routed by the enemy. Next shot - battle has ended (his side lost) Musashi gets up from the ground. He is unharmed. Then why was he laying on the ground? Did he get exhausted from running or what?

Nothing quite makes sense. Mifune's acting is very decent but director does not make full use of it. We barely see his face.",2.0

Some simple, honest narration could have fixed this, but it's not there. Also, the added sound effects -- not in original footage -- can be best characterized as a ""cheesy"" add-on in most instances.",2.0
"If only the director and screenwriter were among them!  This film version of the Broadway play about gay friends who spend three summer weekends together is incredibly clich&eacute;, forced, and feels anything but spontaneous.

Old friends getting together could be interesting, but all these people talk about is being gay and it gets old fast.  There isn't one line of dialogue that is believable or one character that rings true; they're too glib and there's no connection between them or with me. Jason Alexander does a good Nathan Lane impersonation but it's way too much and Lane is better.  John Glover plays twin brothers, one a cranky sourpuss who desperately wants to be loved, the other a sweetheart dying of AIDS.  Neither seemed real to me.  The other characters were more subdued and tolerable, but they still perform like they're reciting lines; there are no pauses or nuances, their characters have no real love, valour, or compassion.

This MUST have played better on the stage, since most of the cast is from the play, but it misses the mark on the big screen.  For me, it was tedious and disappointing and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boys-in-the-Band/dp/B001CQONPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boys in the Band</a>&nbsp;from 1970 is a far better film.",2.0
"""This is my house.  I like to fill it up with my friends....  [Sadly, I don't have any, so these are the miserable people I invited instead.]""  So paraphrases the opening voice-over of the screen adaptation of Terrence McNally's off-Broadway play.  Better it had remained off-Broadway.
LVC is a clear nod to Mart Crowley's 1968 off-Broadway ""Boys in the Band,"" likewise brought to the big screen in 1970.  Like its predecessor, LVC is premised on a gathering of eight disparate and self-loathing NYC gay men with seemingly no emotional bond between them.  Apparently the cultural stereotypes of the 1960's still live on in the 90's, as the group includes a choreographer prone to passive aggressive hissy fits, a bitchy theater queen, an air-headed pretty boy dancer, a whiny couple, and a tiresome yuppie (yes, he DOES tie pastel sweaters around his neck).  Similarly, both films include most of their original theater casts.  Even BITB's final scene of the partygoers line dancing to Martha Reeves and the Vandella's ""Heatwave"" is reprised in an oddly placed performance of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies from ""Nutcracker Suite.""  So with all this in common, what makes BITB a classic of gay cinema and LVC so laughably forgettable?
BITB, as repeated in so many gay retrospectives, hit the stage before the watershed Stonewall Riot of 1969.  It was a whisper before gay identity truly found its voice.  There is something compellingly sympathetic about this collection of men who hang together simply because they can be their uncloseted selves around each other.  Their bitchiness and self-loathing too must be viewed in the context of their repressive era.  This desperate need for camaraderie and acceptance, however, doesn't translate well to LVC and the 1990's.
Or maybe it's the film direction that sets them apart.  William Friedkin, who directed BITB, is no stranger to the screen nor to controversy.  His credits include ""The Exorcist,"" ""French Connection,"" ""Cruising,"" and ""To Live and Die in LA.""  Joe Mantello, by contrast played a couple bit parts in ""Law and Order"" in addition to directing LVC.  And LVC is hardly a groundbreaking movie.
Or maybe it's the actors.  The miscast Jason Alexander (Nathan Lane wisely declined the chance to repeat his stage role) leaves the audience expecting George Castanza's parents and Kramer to barge in at any time.  And I for one would rather have the skin peeled off my still living body than see Jason Alexander in a tutu again.
LVC does attempt to evoke emotional involvement with its inclusion of a character with AIDS.  He comes across, however, as a perfunctory toss-in and is rather unsympathetic, reminiscent of Kenneth Branagh's ""Peter's Friends"".  For films in which HIV is more engaging and integral to the storytelling, see ""Parting Glances"", ""Longtime Companion"", ""Grief"", or ""Opposite of Sex"".
It's very likely that LVC stages much better than it screens.  McNally, after all, wrote ""The Ritz,"" ""Kiss of the Spider Woman,"" ""Ragtime,"" and ""Frankie and Johnny,"" to deserved critical acclaim.  Indeed, the forced dialect (including the sappy final voice-over) is far more appropriate to theater than to cinema.",2.0

"After watching this short video, I find it obvious VeggieTales put this out merely as a filler for people to buy until their actual Jonah movie (VeggieTales first full movie ever, in fact) came out in theaters.

Having never found VeggieTales' message that great to begin with (I strongly dislike the way they cheapen and distort Biblical stories), I'd put this one at the bottom of the heap.
In all fairness, I must say my 5- and 7-year-old little ""brothers"" seemed to find it interesting enough, at least the first couple times. There are some funny jokes -- funny at least if you've watched all the videos in the series up until now, and there's some terrific behind the scenes glimpses of the actors taping their voices for use with the animated characters.

"To begin, House Party 2 is no House Party.  In fact, those that would like to compare the two are completely off their hypothetical film ""rocker"".  These are two completely separate films.  Do you know why?  What originally began as a film about some soulful and youthful teens trying to get to the ultimate dance party has now transformed into this clich morality tale that demonstrates the power of friendship and the strength of humility.  WHAT!  Is that why I wanted to watch this film?  I apologize, but one of the few reasons that I liked House Party was because they followed the K.I.S.S. method (for those unfamiliar it is the Keep It Simple Stupid method) of filmmaking.  In the original, becoming a lyricist, a ladies man, and having the best party in town was the root of the film.  While there was a romantic side to the story, it fell second nature to the growing hip-hop scene.  It was a dance film first, developed character story second.  Honestly, that is what I enjoyed about the film.  While I didn't think House Party was the greatest release of the century, it did have this genuine feel about it.  In fact, after watching this poorly crafted sequel, I have a bit more respect for the original.  Where was the dancing?  Where was the creativity?  Where was the same Kid & Play that I remembered from the first House Party?  They were nowhere to be found in this trashy sequel.

Robin Harris.  We all remember him as ""Pop"" from the original film, but what we do not realize about this humorous comedian is that he subsequently changed the image of the House Party series.  In the original, he was this father trying to steer his son into a path of academia instead of rap and parties, in the sequel, he plays a spirit who annoyingly hounds Kid throughout the film with flashbacks from the original.  Due to his death, he brings nothing new to the table, yet this entire sequel seems to be focused around those few short words that he used in the first film.  I don't mean to be rude, but I never felt that the father was such a big element in the original.  I thought that Kid trying to challenge authority to attempt to find himself was the underlying meaning of the original, while in this one it is Kid repressing his true self in hopes to make his dead father happy.  Where did the lightness of the original go?  I watched House Party 2 thinking that there is a limit that the writers could go without making Kid seem totally whipped by his father's words, but we never hit that limit.  Where, anywhere in this film, was Kid trying to find his rap roots?  I needed to see a young man still interested in becoming the lyricist that he once desired to be?  Why did he have to grow up so fast?  In fact, the rap side-story to this film seems to be the negative element.  We have gone from loving the genre to completely disrespecting it in one film.  Ah, the power of the sequel.

Martin Lawrence was again completely annoying to the point in which I completely tuned him out whenever he spoke.  He brought nothing to the story and nothing to the main characters.  Lawrence was nothing more than a familiar face for the audience to relate to.  In fact, it is that dedication to familiar faces from the original that hurt this sequel.  When the ultimate PAJAMA JAM finally does occur (one hour into this short film), we are hit with an barrage of repetitive scenes of aged rappers and comedians from the original who do nothing but repeat their lines, actions, and emotions from the first.  While many may enjoy these familiar faces, I felt as if it were a cheap trick used to make me feel more comfortable about the film.  If these minor characters had done more than just repeat their lines, than maybe I would have bought into the trick, but instead all I saw were cheap repetitive motions used by writers to fill time.  I used the word ""repetitive"" several times in this paragraph because it demonstrated the annoying repetitive nature of this film and completed my point about using that element as a cheap trick.  I hope it worked.

In most television series, especially the cheapened kind, we sometimes hear a laugh track or a sound machine used to create some ""zany"" or ""wacky"" sound that lightens the mood and creates the viable laugh point.  In House Party 2, I do believe that the sound guy was extremely drunk or possibly working his first day in the booth.  There were more sound effects in this film than in a Bobby McFerrin music video.  Was this a child's movie or another urban comedy?  Neither Kid nor Play could do anything in this film without a ""zip zim"" or a ""whoosh"" or a ""ding dong"" noise happening somewhere in the background.  This was a fresh element to the sequel which direly needed to be taken away.  There is a chase scene near the end of the film which felt like Pee-Wee Herman choreographed it with all the unsettling sounds that were happening.  After the first twenty minutes of this, it because increasingly annoying to the point of insanity.

Overall, this sequel soils the original.  The themes were sporadic (i.e. in one instance we are talking about the oppression of the African American, while in the other the directors seem to be building age-old stereotypes), the characters continued towards their bland downward spiral, those annoying, randomly placed racist police officers were back, and the dominating ""father"" element seemed too serious for the overall theme of this film. I hope this film wasn't an indication of the path of colleges in the future?  House Party 3, don't fail me now!

The other stories were not as interesting:  There's Emma's son, who invites a rather odd and sexually aggressive female in for a hot bath (no really, just a bath!), two little old ladies whose hobby is attending funerals, and two boys who are overly concerned with the development of their primary sexual attributes.  I kept waiting for the next scene with Emma and her mother but. when it came, all they did was trudge along through the gorgeous scenery carping at each other.

"So, if you are a screenwriter and someone hands you a novel by Stephen King, in which the protagonist states at the outset that she killed her husband and then gives an interesting first person narrative of how it was justified, and in which the protagonist's daughter is intentionally kept out of the story at the protagonist's wishes, what would you do?

Here is what Tony ""I just read six John Grisham books"" Gilroy would do.  Eliminate the built-in narration provided for the lead character and instead write in a series of hallucinogenic flashbacks, and not only bring the grown daughter into the picture (again, intentionally written out by Stephen King), but make her the primary detective in a whodunit that attempts to very slowly answer the very obvious question of whether Kathy Bates killed her husband.

Herp dee derp.

I remembered this movie as being average but forgettable when I first watched it, but then took another look after reading the book and realized promptly that this is a two-star job.

Other than a poorly filmed ""teaser"" at the opening, half an hour transpires in the film before we see a scene that had any place in the book whatsoever.  The majority of this half hour is spent following the grown daughter around (never see her in the book) and creating some irrelevant melodrama about romance with her editor (she is a writer) and ambitions about writing some irrelevant story about radiologists.

This is one of the worst novel-to-screenplay conversions I've ever seen.  I realize it was the mid-1990s and you couldn't make a McDonalds commercial without throwing in a legal twist at the end...but for no reason whatsoever, we have a writer playing lawyer/detective and the whole thing actually culminates in a makeshift courtroom drama.

Not to mention, the climax of the screenplay version hinges on the herpes virus of all plot devices - repressed memories!  Wait, it's coming back to me...  Oh my goodness, now I remember!

I also got the impression that John C. Reilly spent about half an hour ""perfecting"" his Maine accent, and both he and Kathy Bates subscribed to the Kevin Costner ""whenever I feel like it"" school of accent consistency.

"""The Rapture"" (1991) is directed by Michael Tolkin with Mimi Rogers as a LA telephone operator who spends her after work hours cruising with her boyfriend in the search of the other couples to swing the partners. She realizes that her life has no purpose and leads her nowhere and she turns to a religious sect for spiritual guidance...

It's been several weeks since I saw the film and I am still not sure what it was, a riveting dark drama about searching for faith, accepting spiritual awakening, preparing yourself for the second coming of Christ and for Apocalypses now or the ridiculous piece of trash. I think it could be both and it depends on how you feel toward the Christianity, the possibility of undergoing a religious conversion, and the readiness to sacrifice the most precious that you have to prove your faith and love for God. It also depends on how you feel about the dialogs in the movie - the quote that I've chosen for the title of this review may give you an idea of what to expect.

What I am sure of is that Mimi Rogers gave a fine performance, and she is a reason enough to see ""The Rapture"". Rogers is a very capable and attractive actress and should be recognized more.

Robert Montgomery (not the Director's first choice) is the less-than-better half who seems  over his acting head most of the time (especially compared to screwball-comedy veteran Lombard's performance).

  Outdoor soundstage sets look just plain phony while indoor sets look just plain cheap (and phony).  Very distracting.  Without Lombard, the film would have gone straight to DV...err, the drive-ins.

"Well, I think Martin Lawrence is a funny actor. I won't compare him to an under rated version of Eddie Murphy like most people do, since I don't think he is. He has his own style, his own way to act etc...and the mere fact that they both star in comedy movies is not that relevant to me.
Anyway I knew this movie would be slightly different from what Lawrence has done in the past. This time it would be a blending of comedy and thriller, something more personal, maybe because he wrote the screenplay and directed the movie. So I watched it trying to stay away from any prejudices and to enjoy it for what it is. I found the movie very uneven. The real plot took way too long to come up. Indeed, the first part trying to settle Lawrence's character and personality is way too long compared to the time left to the plot development and realization, which obviously leads to shortcuts and great haste when it comes to the real story. The goal of the movie, the real aim is therefore not reached entirely, for the comedy part of the movie maybe stole a lead over the drama or thriller part. It was indisputably interesting to try catching another 'usually hidden' side of Martin Lawrence, as a director, a writer trying to deal with something different from what he usually does, but this time it was not that big of a success. Let's not be too harsh there for it may be new to him, and I'm sure we'll see more from him in that field very soon, but I would not rank this movie as a must-see one. I watched it cause I really wanted to discover something new about Lawrence, and in a way I saw some good first steps, but somehow the intention outmatched the means and the way Lawrence handled the making and construction of his work.
But as you can see, this is not a 'Don't go watch this movie' kind of message, it is just a personal view of it. You should try this movie anyway, cause you'll see or at least guess what Martin Lawrence could do with a little more experience and writing discipline.",2.0

Regina King was alright, and Lynn Whitfield does a fine job as the jilted (after provoked) unstable independent lady with her back story, the problem is Martin Lawrence, who also directed the film.. The problem is the corny old ghetto dialogue comin' out of Lawrence and Brown's mouths every time they had to speak.. They come off as complete cheese balls, and Lynn's character had the right idea from the very beginning not to get involved with Lawrence. Nothing he said or did was funny or amusing..and he had the charm of a street beggar lookin' to wash your windshield.. The ending was minimal, cheap and abrupt, and it ends just like a made for TV movie.. No real substance in any of this.

"DVD transfer is B&W and very good to excellent.  Criterion offers its usual bonuses which, frankly, are more interesting than the film itself.

I would like to say that the viewer will be treated to an exceptional film noir but, unfortunately, the film winds up as an overly-dramatic, overly-sappy B movie.  We begin with a bald prostitute beating a man unconcious with her shoe.  Shocking, yes, and it gives the viewer the impression they are about to see something on the order of 'Psycho' or 'Repulsion'.  Instead, our protaganist, Kelly, (Constance Towers) winds up as fallen woman making admends for her former life by working in a crippled children's hospital, struggling to keep a friend from becomming a prostitute and working her way up the social ladder in a small town.  She meets and falls for the town's local millionaire and things seem fine until, we once again find Kelly beating a man, this time to death.  The man is her fiance.  The dead man is determined to be a pedophile (although we are hard pressed to figure out just what it is the man was doing) and our film finally ends with Kelly vindicated.  Yep, that's the plot and I'm not sorry I spoiled it.

It has been rumored that the studio changed and altered Samuel Fuller's work and the result is what you see.  With a plethora of dark topics to work with, the film just lays there, better fit for a Frank Capra touch than film noir.

The presence of Bill Pullman and Diane Lane did very little to alleviate the pain of watching this slooow and boooring mooovie...

In addition, Diane Lane's character was way to pushy/bossy/feminist for late 19th century, making it rather unrealistic.

The fact that the first season episodes were so clear in both picture and sound yet these second season episodes are extremely inferior to season one in both picture and sound quality is ample proof that Shout Factory was too cheap to remaster the original NBC episodes. If any episodes were to be of poorer quality, it would be older episodes because they are....older!!

Therefore, the above-mentioned message wants the viewers of these discs to actually believe that the entire second season of Police Story is not as ""well-preserved"" as the first season. Nonsense. And that's not the worst part........

THE WORST PART is that each and every one of the episodes on the 6 discs of Season Two are the ""syndicated"" versions of Police Story and not the ""complete"" and ""uncut"" episodes that were presented on all of the discs of Season One!!! This means that 4-5 minutes of each episode is missing! When this season aired (in the 1974-1975 television season), one-hour shows were approximately 50 minutes in length (with approximately 10 minutes of commercials). As time went on, one-hour shows became shorter in length in order to increase the commercial time (so, for example, today's one-hour shows are approximately 41 minutes in length with approximately 19 minutes of commercials).

Now....you may ask.....""What happens when a tv station broadcasts an old tv show like Police Story?"".....well, sad to say....the stations do not reduce the commercial time so that people can enjoy watching the full episodes as they originally aired, oh no, that would be too generous. Instead, they keep the same commercial time as shows airing today but remove several minutes of the old tv show episode to make it fit into the length of the modern one-hour tv show.

The Bottom Line: So what you get here is 45-46 minutes of a 50 minute show (the sources of these videos were taken from a time when commercials were longer than they were in 1974-1975 but shorter than they are now in a one-hour time slot). Since one is currently unable to watch the episodes from when they originally aired on NBC in 1974-1975, it's almost impossible to know for sure what scenes were removed from every episode. Maybe there were some very significant scenes removed which added depth to some of the characters. Unfortunately, we may never know.

Also (while Season One came with a nice, blue pamphlet inside the dvd case describing each episode), Season Two lacks any pamphlet but includes the episode descriptions and air dates (very cheaply) on the back of the DVD cover slide! So if you want to read what all of the episodes are about, you have to take out the 1st and 6th discs to read them. I give this product a 2-star rating because ""any Police Story episodes are better than no Police Story episodes.""

Since I had to wait 6 years for this deceptive release, I will not hold my breath for the release of other great tv shows (e.g. Toma, The Name of the Game, Hec Ramsey), at least not from Shout Factory.",2.0

"I was looking forward to watching this movie.  I already knew the ""secret"" about who or what the serial killer was before I sat down to view it, but it didn't really matter as the movie didn't make much use of it as it turns out.  The movie was slow, very slow, and filmed in this murky, shadowy kind of way that I supposed was meant to make it seem creepy or dark, but it didn't really make the movie scarier.  In fact, this movie wasn't really scary at all.  The plot rambled on, making little use of the great crew of actors in it--Washington, Goodman, Sutherland.  None of them could save this movie from being predictable and bland.

Some spoilers below:

So, these cops are investigating what seems like the work of a serial killer, save for it doesn't seem to be the same person.  Denzel's character goes deeper into the mystery and eventually figures out that it isn't some bad guy killing people, but a demon thousands of years old who is inside people making them do bad things.  He tracks down this demon's name and then is plagued by the demon, who keeps jumping from person to person, until Denzel ends up on the run from his own cop buddies.  Oh, but wait, he finds a way to kill the demon...at a great sacrifice to himself.

Of course, this single paragraph takes a LONG time to happen in the movie, while we are treated to snatches of ""time on my side"" as sung by the demon and lots of scenes that don't serve much purpose.  If the plot had included more soul-searching by the main character, if the demon had been more than just a plot device (he has no reason to torment this cop rather than just killing him outright...I guess just being a demon is enough reason?), and if the movie had more properly addressed the question of Good vs Evil, I think it might have been a far better movie.  As it is, it fails as a horror movie, it fails as a thriller, and it isn't much of a mystery.

I don't blame the actors.  I blame the scriptwriter and the director.  Worth watching once.  Maybe.  Not worth watching a second time and definitely not a keeper.",2.0

Good,2.0
"It's a decent movie (only in that it is well-made with good actors) but is not scary and could have been much better. I enjoy watching movies with Denzel Washington in them and so that made it worthwhile. It had a okay premise, though not that original: an executed man can transfer his soul from person to person by the slightest touch and thus continue living and killing; how can a mere detective really stop him?

Answer: he doesn't. He tried, but the ending was disappointing. I was under the impression that Denzel (Detective John Hobbes) was going to be successful. The demon in its host is led out into the middle of nowhere and is shot...the detective makes it so that he will also die, thus
the demon will have nobody alive to transfer to and will expire.

Yet the demon lives-on through a regular house cat that happens to wander out of the woods and that's the end. We're told earlier on that the demon would have ""just a breath"" to make it to another host. It should have expired right away since that cat didn't arrive until much later.

A cooler ending would have been if too-much time had passed and we see the demon being destroyed because it didn't make it. . .and then the cat appeared. That would leave you wondering about how it almost survived.

Also, something else neat would have been is if a deer was in the wooded area (which would be more likely). I picture the demon taking over the deer...it running away (and the audience thinking the movie's over)...but then the animal gets shot a hunter hiding from a distance and the demon couldn't make it to the new host in time.

Another idea: What if Detective Hobbes became a Christian? A demon cannot occupy the same place as the Holy Spirit. Hobbes didn't have to end his life; he could have been on the lookout for any other animals to kill so that the demon Azazel wouldn't have a host. Evidently, though, he wasn't thinking of animals in the woods as being potential hosts. Still, Hobbes would have eventually been found guilty of killing the boss and he was already being framed...so he was in a bad situation. I know this wasn't meant to come across a spiritually-accurate film or one for Christians, but this is a plot-point that could have taken place and it would have been intriguing. It would have been good to see Denzel's character deal with faith and have some character development.

It's pretty sad, I'd say, seing how the demon could enter EVERYBODY in the city (except Hobbes, again, for some unknown reason) it encountered. Well, it does show/imply that this is a world with fallen, sinful people who have no reverence for God and that it was easy for the fallen angel to posess them. There were NO believers???

As for the demon not surviving in the end, it wouldn't have worked anyway -- according to the script -- because the story starts with the narration of how it ""almost died"". Of course, while watching the movie, you hear any narration in the voice of Denzel's and his character -- yet it's really the demon telling you his story. I thought that was a neat idea that fooled me.

OTHER, VARIOUS THOUGHTS:

- Before the killer (Reese) was placed in the gas chamber, why didn't the demon that possessed him just enter one of the guards? The killer (which, we learn, is guilty all because of the demon's long-term possession that made him kill) was already going to die, so the demon should have just left...but there'd be no movie, then.

- Not only can the demon pass from body by touch, but -- as the DVD case says -- by the brush of clothing? That's even more ridiculous.

- The lady (daughter of the former officer Milano) tells Hobbes that Reese was posessed by the demon Azazel...and that ""it didn't work"" when Reese shook Hobbes' hand (Reese tried to takeover Hobbes then). Why didn't it work? What was so special about him? It's already been established he wasn't a believer in God. He answered the daughter, when she asked about his belief in God, that he went to church at times (which ultimately is not an answer and
going to a building doesn't prove anything).

- Why would it be that Azazel would have to kill whatever host he occupies before he could then
enter Hobbes? Remember at the end fight, when Jonesy/Azazel asked Hobbes why he wouldn't let him kill himself? Jonesy/Azazel said he wanted to do it so he could ""become"" Hobbes and that would end up with Hobbes eventually being guilty of killing Jonesy + the boss. Thus, it was similar to how Milano was set-up in the past.

- It would have been more realistic if, once the demon moved into someone else, the former host
would experience shock and react like ""What the heck happened to me? Where am I?"" All of the people just have moments of amnesia/forgetfulness and just go about their business no matter what. Silly.

"I liked this film somewhat and thought the premise was very interesting. The cast is excellent, but the pacing is slow and everyone involved seems to be too calm considering what's going on. The film suffers from being too long and a good 20 minutes trimmed off would have helped a great deal. Denzel Washington holds it all together in this ultimately predictable thriller, but I doubt I would sit through it a second time. I rate it 2 1/2 stars for a good premise and cast.",2.0
"A sincere attempt at a Stephen King type film quickly turns into an Alan King type production. Only the acting skills of Denzel Washington and Donald Sutherland prevent this supposed thriller from  becoming a 3 Stooges affair. Warned not to get involved in a closed murder case, Officer Denzel does just the opposite and mayhem ensues. A demon is unearthed who writes in ancient Aramaic, yet prefers listening to the ""Rolling Stones"" in English. This supernatural creature can occupy only one human at a time,but can jump from one person to another in a split second. As dead bodies start piling up,Denzel decides to become the sacrificial lamb, poisoning himself after seemingly all targets of demon occupation have eliminated one another. Frustrated, the demon finally wins out, occupying a stray cat. The flick ends with a loud rendition of ""Sympathy for the devil"". ""Nineteenth nervous brekdown"" would hav been better.",2.0

"A friend of mine counts this as one of her favorite films, raving about its brilliance, twists and turns, and of course, the necessity that I see it. I never saw quite the value she saw in it. Certainly it was gripping, suspenseful and showcased typically good performances from Denzel Washington (as John Hobbes) and John Goodman (as Hobbes's partner Jonesy). Elias Koteas also turns in a great performance as a serial killer as he is about to be executed, who rants crazily in some unknown language and lays the groundwork in doing so for Hobbes's later theory that a demon was responsible for murders, traveling from one person's body to another. While the story had all the elements of a good thriller, I perhaps was in too giddy a mood to take the story seriously, fixating instead on the robe worn nearly constantly by Hobbes's brother Art. In nearly every scene where Art appears, I would yell out, ""Is Art's robe in this scene?"" thereby effectively ruining some otherwise intense scenes. Yes, it was juvenile and has nothing to do with the merits of the film. Overall the plot delves deeply into supernatural territory, which will not be terribly satisfying to everyone, including me. My interest was lost along with what appeared to be the last bit of footing the plot had.",2.0
"I am a fan of Denzel Washington, and I think John Goodman is a very good actor, but this movie did not live up to the expectations. The main reason is that the plot just unravels even before halfway, it simply is not believable in any sense. And the final was a letdown and a vain attempt to be even creepier than the movie. I don't particularly have a problem with supernatural thrillers, but this one just doesn't make the cut. No matter how good the actors are and the acting is, when the material you work with is bad, there is not much you can do.",2.0
"A stylish and suspensful film with a great premise. THE FALLEN is a pretty good mystery, supernatural, suspense thriller. It's ALL THAT up to the last 5-to-10 minutes. However, the bottom falls out at the climax and it leaves the audience either confused, empty, angry or all of the above (while the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" plays in the background of the closing credits).  An evil entity transfers to different human hosts through physical contact, takes over their body, and goes on a killing spree leading the authorities to believe that there is a serial killer or copy-cat killer on the loose.  Denzel Washington as Detective John Hobbes figures out what is going on through riveting police work and must suspend all doubts of the supernatural to prepare a plan to fight the evil presence.  What happens in the end destroys the story and the credibility of the lead character (Washington) as the evil entity is allowed to escape (a la Hannibal Lecter in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - -perhaps the producers thought they could get a sequel out of it). The open-end conclusion is what hurts the film.  This reviewer became engrossed in the film, but, ultimately felt cheated by the end and felt 2 hours of time was wasted.",2.0

"...A brilliant idea was left to rot.

John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) is the capturer of a serial killer, Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, in the film's best role), who is sent to his  death laughing and singing and promising that he'd be back. While some  discrepancies between Reese and the evidence in the murders he committed  nags at Hobbes, a riddle Reese asked him shortly before the execution turns  up the suicide of a polieman thirty years ago and entangles Hobbes in the  web that binds these two cases together with thousands of years of history  and the supernatural.

Yeah, it's a great premise. Too bad it's given  such short shrift in here. Every aspect of this film was done better in  Seven, despite the difference in their mechanations (the killer in Fallen  really IS supernatural), and held up against its predecessor, Fallen leaves  a whole lot to be desired.",2.0

If it had been nurtured, steered towards hard-core horror and treated with respect by its handlers, 'Fallen' could have been a good, lower-profile  hit.

Washington is passable  in the lead role but Goodman is abysmally mismatched in this picture.  There's way too much of Hollywood's 'big boom' explosion feel here which  likewise raises eyelids with lighting rather than fear. The pace is  questionable - the film takes far far too long to even try and start to  move. What's worst of all is that there's a total tongue-in-cheekness taken  by the director to the occult subjet matter. With the demons of old, you  were warned not to mess around with the occult through sheer fear. Here,  there's too much violence and too little satanic overtone. While this movie  was supposed to have warned you about the consequences of living in a world  of demonic possession, instead it serves as a warning for you not to pick  it up for anything more than a rental. Make sure you have a coupon to go  with that rental, just to make sure. I hate the 1990's and how bad things  have become in all film genres, but particularly horror.

"I watched this movie not too long ago after having not seen it in many years.  I found the story to be plausible, but the bad acting and choppy story flow left much to be desired.  From what I understand, this movie was originally set as a drama, but it was turned into comedy for the sake of mass appeal.  If it was a drama it would have made a little more sense.

Demi Moore plays Erin, a single mom who is looking to make ends meet and keep custody of her daughter.  Like a lot of desperate women with no education or skills, she turns to the pole.  She's a likeable gal despite the sleaze and desperation a job and enviornment like this constitutes, and is completely drug free as well.  (Now we're talking fiction!)  Burt Reynolds, in the only true comic relief in this movie, is a senator who's a little off his meds one day when he sees Erin dancing and becomes obsessed with her, providing the one and only plot movement to see what will happen once they see each other again.  And there's some crime or something that they witness in between and there's a twist in it.  Or something.

THis was a vehicle for showing us Demi's buff and tumble body.  I admit, I hope I will look like her at age 40, let alone after one, let alone after THREE children.  And perhaps she wanted to make us a little jealous, but now I have every reason to be jealous since she's married to Ashton Kutcher 15 years her junior.  Still, it's a weak movie.  If you need some eye candy of Demi Moore, you're better off looking for stills on the Internet.",2.0
"...the flop that deserves six of its Razzies and the nomination for Worst Picture of the Decade?

I think, ""Striptease"" (1996) directed by Andrew Bergman based on the book by Carl Hiaasen, is all of the above - a curious mixture of laughs, satire, absurdism, darkness, silliness, and over-seriousness. The latter comes from Demi Moore who plays Erin Grant, the FBI secretary - losing her job and the custody over her daughter to no good small time crook wheelchairs stealing husband (Robert Patrick looking and acting like a stoned, redneck version of Gary Oldman) and who takes a job as an exotic dancer in the local club ""Eager Beaver"" to earn money for her court appeal. In the club she becomes the hottest attraction and meets many...interesting characters, the most colorful being, of course Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) who ""just loves naked women. It's a character flaw"" and who is absolutely smitten by Erin. Erin also makes friends with a club bouncer, Shad (Ving Rhames) who is perhaps the best thing in the movie - clever, sharp, sarcastic, with the great sense of humor. One scene where Shad tells to Dilbeck's bodyguards that Meryl Streep used to work in ""Eager Beaver"" as an exotic dancer and they seem to believe him is brilliant. If only everything had been as good as he was we would've had a really great movie. What do we have now? Well, Demi Moore looks really good with the minimum clothes on. I mean, the woman was a 33 year old mother of three at the time and her body was marvel to behold. I just think that she was too serious, intense, and solemn doing the striptease numbers - after all it is not only strip it is tease, too. It goes to her acting in the movie in general. Reynolds seemed to have a lot of fun with his sleazy drunk Congressman David Dilbeck, election-day choice of Christian groups and a lot of laughs comes from his mannerism and quotes. There are plenty of laughs, actually, in ""Striptease"" but quite often they seem like the wrong and unintentional type for the movie material.

Who had the best laugh? I'd guess, Demi Moore did after been paid $12.5 million - one of the highest paychecks for an actress back then.

"This movie is not a fully erotic movie as it might be expected. But it is not a clever and funny movie either. So what makes Striptease bad,I guess,is that it doesn't manage to satisfy any taste at all.
Erin Grant (Demi Moore) must strip for a living,and her biggest fight is against her ex-husband to get her little daughter back. Meanwhile a [physically excited] congressman (Burt Reynolds)gets fixated on her,a murder occurs and things get quite complicated.
Striptease has humor at times,but not much really happens. The plot,if there is any,is pretty weak. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is probably Demi Moore and her dancing on beautiful Eurythmics songs. However other than those ""music videos"",there is nothing else to care about in the movie. I wish Eurythmics used Demi on their videos,which would make making a movie like Striptease unnecessary.
The DVD doesn't have a single extra as it suffers from being an old release,so I can not show any reason why you should buy this DVD,except if you are a hardcore Demi fan..",2.0
"Demi Moore as a stripper.  Burt Reynolds in a satirical role as a politician with a few screws loose.  Smooth and rhythmic sounds from Annie Lennox.  What more could you ask for?  How about a film that doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewing public.  I guess that would be too much to ask.
The movie is almost B grade but the performances of Reynolds and Armand Assante in particular manage to keep this film from totally going in the toilet.

"The story of this movie is not much at all... actually it is weak and I knew this even before I buy this DVD.
But what made it worth buying is to see Demi Moore strip for you... that's it!
So if you are a fan of Demi Moore and want to see her strip for you... go for it. If not, don't even consider buying it!",2.0
"While not Carl Hiaasen's best novel -- I'd nominate ""Skin Tight"" or ""Native Tongue"" for that -- ""Strip Tease"" is far wiser, funnier and richer than the anemic film version by Demi Moore would have you believe.
Instead of FBI secretary-turned-stripper Erin being a strangely desexualized perfect being, in the novel, she's a complicated mess. In other words, a real human being. Her ex-husband is a piece of crap, yes, but not the cartoonish lout we see in the film. Really, everyone in a Hiaasen novel is a bit of a goofball, once their foibles are looked at unflinchingly, which is part of the fun.
Those only familiar with ""Strip Tease"" via the movie don't get any of that: The good guys are too good to screw up, and the bad guys are too stupid to have any redeeming qualities. And to top it all off, Demi apparently doesn't understand that stripping is meant to titillate, not spiritually enlighten its audience. Those aroused by the film ought to get out more.
In fact, the book tops the film in every way, with the possible exception of what Burt Reynolds brings to the film. But even then, in his role as a corrupt politician -- and, ultimately, the engine for the story -- punches are pulled and he's not quite as sleazy as in the book. Apparently, giving people a lesson into how greed is destroying the Everglades was just too heavy for the film audience.
Those who liked the film -- and they exist, strangely enough -- still ought to pick up the book, to learn all about the characters and read the situations that didn't make the final cut. For current fans of Hiaasen's work, the book is roughly on par with ""Stormy Weather,"" although much more politically barbed than that work, which took aim at humanity's folly generally.
And for Demi Moore, what were you thinking? You owe Carl and his fans a big apology, as well as your own fans, who deserve better.",2.0

First, for the aviation enthusiast there is a significant amount of archival footage from the 1930s and second, for the movie buff there is a chance to see David Niven toward the beginning of his career and Leslie Howard at the end of his, both playing characters to type.

Now then, what is wrong with it?
- In many places the quality of the print is quite poor with significant blurring and double images.
- In some places there are ""artistic"" sky effects designed to produce some emotional reactions that are just plain awful. They couldn't have been any better on a wide screen.
- The dialog is often stilted and unreal, though I suppose it is possible that Brits in the 1930s talked like this.
- The depiction of R.J. Mitchell's professional life is entirely misleading. He was a highly respected and honored aircraft designer with a skilled and dedicated team who he very closely and intensly supervised. This is almost entirely ignored in the movie. You would think that R.J. made every drawing for his airplanes himself working in isolation in his office. A very different view is found in every written history of his work, such as Schneider Trophy to Spitfire by John Shelton.
- The portrayal of British rearmament in the 1930s may have met the needs of 1942 British propaganda but bears little relation to the facts as revealed in books such as The Royal Air Force and Aircraft Design 1923-1939 by Colin Simott and many others.

So we have to ask ourselves - why watch this movie as anything other than a historical curiosity? It so distorts both history and biography of a really remarkable man and his story.",2.0
"This is the movie with the famous scene of Cary Grant carrying the glass of milk up the stairs.  Hitchcock placed a light bulb into the milk to make it look more menacing.  Joan Fontaine did her usual job as a spineless victim (see Rebecca).  The only problem with this movie is that the plot is so addled - whether Cary Grant is a murderer or not is almost beside the point, since he is definitely a pathological liar - not marriage material.",2.0

"I probably won't get a lot of helpful votes for this, but I cant help but wonder why anyone would actually love this film.  I understand that the pedigree is high here (Hitchcock, Grant, Fontaine) and Oscar did go for this in Best Actress (Fontaine beat out a really strong and tight category) but watching this last night made me question the love for this film.

Why?

There are so many things wrong with this film that Im not even sure where to begin.  First thing Ill say is that Joan Fontaine is actually VERY good here and the most consistent and admirable aspect of the film.  I won't trash her, since shes actually worthy of the mention (although Id contest that Oscar win in a heartbeat).  The rest of the film doesnt fare too well with me.

Hitchcock was the master of suspense.  We all know this.  This was a flop in tone.  I mean, the first half plays out like an awkward romantic comedy, and the second half plays out like a campy thriller that fails to ever truly latch onto fear.  In fact, the end itself is ridiculous, and for that I blame the studio (who censored the real ending and pushed for something upbeat, which degrades the rest of the film and basically sets you up for an anticlimactic conclusion) but Hitchcocks sense of direction here is sloppy.  The tonal consistency is so all over the place that its embarrassing.  Then you have to factor in Cary Grant, who feels terribly miscast here.  He is too charming and jolly, but not in a manipulative way, so you never once question him.  He has vices, but a killer?  That ending feels like a betrayal, but sadly appropriate.

I know that many people love this, but I don't get it.  You can love everyone involved, but a stinker is a stinker, and this one stinks pretty badly.",2.0
"Joan Fontaine played the same part in ""Rebecca"" that she plays here: a self-conscious woman with the self-esteem of a Jainist.  I must say she is superb playing such docile doormats - but could she play anything else?  Question - did she win the Oscar for her acting prowess or because the members of the academy felt sorry fpr the character?

  As for Grant's character - how anyone in their right mind could find this cad charming is beyond me.  It is a trap of sorts - if you fall for Johnnie Boy as she does does it indicate you have the same weaknesses she suffers from?  The ending is tacked on and refutes everything we have been watching up to that time.  The ending is not a twist as in ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" - it is a con, it is a cheat and it is cheap.  Hitchcock must have hated having to bend to studio pressure.  Yet even had the film been released with its original (and substantially more realistic) ending some problems would still exist.

  One of the many problems with the script's credibility is Johnnie's attraction to Fontaine's character.  Money is not the motive, as she asserts other eligible women he could have married have much more money than she does.  One might answer that he marries her BECAUSE of her docility, that it is because he knows that she will allow him to take advantage of her - but that answer is belied by the tacked on ending.  She marries him not knowing he has no income.  Really? Johnnie ignores her for months on end and then appears claiming he loves her madly and she, poor pathetic thing believes it. Really?  Had Fontaine's part been played by a callow 18 year old her actions (or lack of same) might be excusable, but Ms. Fontaine was well over thirty in 1941.  Was the script written by a mysogynist?  It certainly seems to have been written by someone not at all acquainted with human nature or, for that matter, humans.  It is too formulaic - every bit of verisimilitude is sacrificed for the plot - and even that is mangled in the last few minutes.

  Watch Grant's face as his closest friend almost dies - pure malevolence.  Watch Grant's face as he hears he gets nothing in his father in law's will - cold-blooded anger.  Listen to Grant's tone of voice when he chides his simpering wife for interfering in his business - self-righteous indignation.  Any man who insists on calling the woman he supposedly loves ""Monkey Face"" is not loving at all, but cruelly mocking; and any woman who puts up with not being called ANYTHING endearing (let alone her name) and stands for it is to be pitied and wondered at.  It is quite one thing for a character to have many sides to his personality; it is quite another for a character to become someone else entirely (smacks of schizophrenia).  The happy ending has not been earned.  If you enjoy watching the doings of a masochist married to a merry sadist who then turns out to be someone else entirely you will rave about this film. Imagine Uncle Charlie in ""Shadow of a Doubt"" showing himself to be a kind, benevolent soul and his niece being a cold-hearted murderer at movie's end and you get the idea.  You want great Hitchcock, look elsewhere.",2.0
"I don't care for this film because it's very hard to watch Cary Grant be a dead-beat. The plot seems awkward, and I'm never thoroughly convinced that Grant's character ever really loves anyone besides himself. This film is like a 1940s version of ""Who the Bleep Did I Marry?"" I think we all like to see Cary Grant as the suave, debonaire and often humorous character that he played so well. It's just not comfortable watching him be a louse. Hitchcock and Grant teamed up for much better films, such as ""North by Northwest"" and ""To Catch a Thief.""",2.0
It started off well enough . . . the geeky beautiful girl who was tempted by a guy (I would say good looking but Grant appeared very tired and kinda aged in this movie even though he was also looking young [not so puffy of a face]) to awaken her quest to find a relationship. But then . . .well it just turned into a soap opera . . . the day time soap opera type of nonsense. And from that point I just spared myself the senseless emotional manipulation by turning it off.,2.0
"""Suspicion"" is a 1941 crime drama from Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine with Nigel Bruce, Cedric Hardwicke, and Leo G. Carroll. It was based on a 1932 novel ""Before the Fact"" by Anthony Berkeley who is considered the ""father of the psychological suspense novel.""

By 1941 Cary Grant (1904-86) was a major star. He became well known for films like ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933) and ""Sylvia Scarlett"" (1935). But Mae West took credit for ""She Done Him Wrong"" and ""Sylvia Scarlett"" was a box office flop, and it wouldn't be until ""The Awful Truth"" (1937) that he would emerge as a star.  Though generally well regarded (AFI rates him 2nd greatest male star ever), Grant never won a major acting award and received only 2 Oscar nominations in more than 70 film outings. I liked him best in ""Gunga Din"" (1939), ""His Girl Friday"" (1940) and ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940). This was the first of 4 films he made with Hitchcock, who said of him - ""the only actor I ever loved in my whole life"". Bear in mind, Hitchcock was fond of saying that actors should be treated as cattle.

Joan Fontaine (1917) co-stars as Grant's  wife. She's the younger sister of film great Olivia de Havilland and was a star in her own right. Fontaine was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, and won for this film - the only actor to ever win an Oscar in a Hitchcock film. She worked with Hitch the previous year in his American debut, ""Rebecca"", and among her other notable films were ""The Constant Nymph"" (1943), ""Jane Eyre"" (1944), ""Ivanhoe"" (1952), and ""Island in the Sun"" (1957).

Nigel Bruce (1895-1953) is best known as Dr. Watson  in all 14 of the Rathbone Holmes films. Bruce had quite a distinguished career apart from the Holmes' films, appearing in many British films like ""Treasure Island"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934), ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). He worked with Hitchcock in ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Suspicion"" (1941). Bruce plays a friend of Grant and he gives one of his most remarkable performances ever.

Cedric Hardwicke's (1893-1964) strong voice and stony appearance graced nearly 100 films. He played the evil bishop in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), Dr. Livingstone in ""Stanley and Livingstone"" (1939), and King Arthur in ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1949). I remember him best as the Pharaoh in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). Hardwick worked with Hitchcock again in ""Rope"" (1948). He plays Fontaine's father.

Leo G. Carroll (1892-1972) appeared in 6 Hitchcock films, an accomplishment exceeded by only one other actor - Clare Greet who appeared in 7. Carroll is best known for his TV series ""Topper"" (1953-6) and ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (1964-8) but he gave excellent performances in more than 50 films, including ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938), Wuthering Heights"" (1938), ""The House on 92nd Street"" (1945), and ""The Desert Fox"" (1951). Don't sneeze or you'll miss Leo. He plays Grant's cousin.

Franz Waxman (1906-67) provides the musical score. Waxman was nominated for an Oscar 10 times and won twice (""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Sunset Blvd""). He was a favorite of Hitchcock who used him in 4 films and earned 2 of his Oscar nominations (""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion""). At times Waxman's music could be overbearing (e.g., ""Objective Burma""), but when he was good he was great. Waxman is good in this film, using the music to heighten the tension without distracting from the action, and playfully altering Strauss' waltz to fit Grant's behavior.

The film did well with critics and the public. It was the 15th highest grossing film of the year, but garnered only one Oscar. 1941 was a terrific year for films - ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", Sergeant York"", ""How Green Was My Valley"", Meet John Doe"", ""Buck Privates"", ""They Died with Their Boots On"", ""The Sea Wolf"" ""High Sierra"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and ""A Yank in the RAF"".

Personally I find the film lacking. The cheap sets and special effects that Hitchcock was so accustomed to using in his work at British International/Gaumont are out of place in a 1941 American production, even if it was RKO. And bear in mind that ""Suspicion"" was produced by Hitch, so he couldn't blame Selznick as he was won't to do.

In addition, the tone of the film is shaky. It begins as a romantic comedy (see his ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" that came out at the same time) and moves awkwardly into a suspense thriller, or is it really a film about a woman's descent into paranoia. The inability to keep his eye on the mark is undoubtedly caused by the casting of Cary Grant into a film that calls for him to play a psychopathic degenerate gambler to kill his wife. The film follows the book reasonably well with some notable exceptions - Grant's adultery, his involvement in the death of Fontaine's father,  and the ending.  But by taking the threads of the book and removing significant thematic material, we are left with an unsettling story. In later years Hitch claimed that he was forced to accept these changes, but his biographer Donald Spoto claims he was fully aware of the changes.

Fans of Hitchcock or Grant can find many many better films to watch.

FWIW - Look for Hitch about 48 minutes into the film, mailing a letter. And the dog you see is actually Hitch's own dog",2.0
"Cut from the same stylistic cloth as ""Rebecca,"" director Alfred Hitchcock's first teaming with Cary Grant was this disappointing 1941 adaptation of Francis Iles' novel ""Before the Fact."" Hitchcock successfully cast Grant against type as Johnnie  a reckless, irresponsible playboy who marries the shy Lina (played by an ineffectual Joan Fontaine). Because of mounting circumstantial evidence, Lina suspects that her husband is a murderer. Lina's psychological tug of war builds to a ludicrous climax that negates the entire film. If Hitchcock had his way, ""Suspicion"" would have evolved into a disturbing thriller rather than a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, RKO altered the framework of ""Suspicion"" with the same callous insensitivity that marred Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons."" Another drawback is the lack of chemistry between Grant and Fontaine. In future films, Hitchcock made certain Grant was paired with romantically compatible co-stars such as Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly. ""Suspicion"" should be viewed as a blueprint for a more rewarding Hitchcock-Grant collaboration, ""Notorious"" (1946).",2.0
"I'm a big fan of Hitchcock but this film just doesn't work for me and the reason for that is the casting of Cary Grant in the main role.  In order for this film to work you have to be able to buy Cary Grant as a possible murderer.  I mean, it's CARY GRANT.  You know he's not going to murder anyone.  As a consequence there's no tension in this movie at all because you know he's innocent from the get-go.  Now if they had given Joseph Cotton the role things would have been different.",2.0
"Although Fontaine and Grant are marvelous, and Hitchcock's direction is great as always, Suspicion suffers from a major script flaw. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll only say that the end felt like a major cop-out and, after I saw the feature with comments on the making on the film, and the changes made to the original screenplay, I can confirm that's exactly what it was. A shame, because this could have been an amazing movie.",2.0
"First off let me warn you that the colourised version of this movie is SO BAD. If you buy it make sure you get the black and white version. The colourised one looks like someone... a five year old child... took paint and slapped it all over the film. It's awful.
Second of all let me warn you that this is NOT one of the best Hitchcock films. I find it really aggravating at moments, because Cary Grant's character drives me looney with his incessant fibbing and calling Lina ""monkeyface"". I did like the hairdo he gave her. Overall his acting is annoying here. In his other three Hitchcock films - Notorious, North by Northwest, and To Catch a Thief - he was much better. Joan Fontaine is basically the same character as she played in Rebecca, except that here it is rather tiring to watch her simper and swoon and be all sentimental over her man... In Rebecca I felt the role called for all that naive schoolgirl stuff. Here it isn't right. Ingrid Bergman could have done wonders for this movie...
I can say some positive things too, however. The costumes were lovely - what I could see of them under the sloppy colourisation. The story itself was quite good as well, except of course the controversial ending... which personally I felt was just one last lie from Cary and that he did kill her after they got home. Far too abrupt, whatever it was supposed to mean. The guy who played Beaky was one of the best characters - at least I didn't feel like he was acting. The murder mystery writer lady was good in her part, and her mortician brother was as well.
It would have been nice to have a bit more development with the characters. In most every other Hitchcock film, you know what they think and how they feel... here I was never sure.

"Daniel Day Lewis as a Prague doctor, hoping for a little afternoon pleasure while on a medical trip, hits upon and scores with Juliette Binoche, but drives off, rudely, in his sports car, when his afternoon delight reveals she lives with her mother. End of story, until she shows up at his door in Prague to continue the conversation. Great opening, but soon I couldn't help but wonder why these two oddball Berlin Wall era ambiguous revolutionaries are so madly in love with each other. We are told that repeatedly, and a marriage union locks the deal, but they seem about as chemically inclined towards one another as a bland peanut butter and jelly sandwich; there for the sake of being. But they are, apparently, the Scarlet and Rhett of the fall of The Soviet Empire, helplessly involved in a Cold War deadlock with Russians who are revealed as typically sitting at a long table in a bar, kicking back vodkas, and behaving like Boris and Natasha from The Bullwinkle cartoons. Come on, really? Lena Olin's nude exhibition with a tophat was a pretentious symbol of democratic freedom, and the potboiler romance and revolution is forever on a low simmer, when it needs to be boiling over. If the film would have stopped when Juliette Binoche shows up unexpectedly at Daniel Day Lewis's door, and they made wild rebellious graphic sex defying all conventions for the duration of the film, (no top hats please, that is SO Al Pacino 'Cruising'), this cold war wouldn't have been so frigid.",2.0

"Here's the thing; I'm really a big Mel Brooks fan but this film doesn't do it.  I'm sure a few hundred other learned and astute people have pointed out the differences between this movie and Young Frankenstein.  Let me add my brief and dumbed-down critique in that line.  Young Frankenstein was about 25% straight story and 75% great gags; Dead and Loving It is about 75% straight story (why???) and 25% gags.  Wonderful sets, great photography, straight story . . . and jokes that are few and far between.  Is it the absence of Gene Wilder that tells here?
  There are some very funny bits.  Some.  And that's the issue/problem.  No real spoiler here but one of the strongest moments (90 seconds with no cut!) is the stake through the heart bit done in pseudo-Monty Python style.  Another is the problems that can develop when you've accidently hypnotized two people at the same time.
  Maybe I'd go 2 1/2 stars.  For me it's the interminable straight story that dogs this film down.  (As if I could do better . . . )",2.0
"Vastly overrated entry in the Nightmare On Elm Street series, NOES3: Dream Warriors is barely passable for an evening's rental.  Gone are the dark overtones that set the serie's standard with the original NOES.  Instead we  have our villian showcasing bad one-liners and losing what little aura of  fear he sustained after the last sequel. Even the attempt here to bring the  NOES series into more of a fantasy/horror realm is filled with many missed  opportunities. The film's greatest selling point,  that the Elm Street kids  can fight back against their nocturnal assailant with their own  personalized dream powers,  is filled with great promise.....but ends up  taking a backseat once the bodies start piling up.  The performances are  passable at best,  with the returning Heather Langenkamp coming across as  shockingly ineffective after her great performance in the original  installment. Still, it is great to see John Saxon and Craig Wasson  exchanging blows and glances.  The special effects sequences are varied in  quality. Some of the effects,  like the Freddy Puppet are ingenious and  well-done.  However, the showdown in the junkyard with Wasson and Saxon  dueling with a stop-motion skeleton looks, unfortunately, just like  that....two actors miming a fight with a superimposed stop-motion creation.  Still,  for all it's faults, NOES3:DW is worth a night's rental to catch  some of the better special effects of the series and to recapture some of  that 80's nostalgia (Dokken on the soundtrack!). spg2@earthlink.net",2.0

Dracula could have come  back during the 1967 summer of love and start tripping on the LSD and other drugs in the hippie chicks blood.

"A few interesting ideas here -- including a sequence in which Dracula enjoys a bit of sunshine -- but on the whole, Mel Brooks's shticky spoof of Francis Ford Coppola's BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA (with visual homages to Universal and Hammer horror) keeps taking the easy way out.  The result feels rather like a middling ""Your Show of Shows"" sketch stretched to about eighty minutes.  Leslie Nielsen is miscast in the title role (which really cries out for a Sid Caesar), and only Harvey Korman and Brooks himself seem to understand how this material should be played.  Production design looks nice, though.",2.0
Dracula - Dead and Loving It is a 1995 movie starring Leslie Nielsen as Dracula and Mel Brooks as Van Helsing. One would think that such a comedic duo would create an amazing comedic satire but the end result is quite mediocre. Some of the jokes are quite funny but on the whole it feels very much so so. Nielsen plays on autopilot and Brooks has seen better days. The costumes look on the cheap and even though it is only about 90 minutes it feels like an overly long movie.

They must have been insane.  ""Young Frankenstein"" is possibly the best of all the Mel Brooks comedies, while this is close to the worst.

"It was about ten years ago that I first watched Mel Brooks' ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It"" and I found it not as funny as I expected from the director of ""Young Frankenstein."" Since then Mel Brooks, it seems, stopped directing films, which is a sad thing if it is true, but anyway I decided to watch his ""Dracula"" again after a decade. The only part I thought funny ten years ago was the scene where Steven Weber's character drives a stake into poor, lovely un-dead Lucy's heart, but is this film really so unfunny?

Sorry if you're an avid Mel Brooks fan, but I had the same impression as before after the second viewing - actors all are doing a good job, but the gags are repetitious and too mild, neither big, clever nor outrageous enough to make me laugh. The storyline itself follows that of Bela Lugosi's 1931 version with numerous references to other new and old Dracula films. They are fine, but Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) appears twice with a Gary Oldman-like hairdo while once is enough. Anne Bancroft appears as ""Madame Ouspenskaya"" prophesying with a strange voice one too many time.

At times, I suspect that Mel Brooks is really trying to make a horror, not a comedy here, for at certain points the film looks as if it stopped being a spoof. I had the same kind of feeling when I saw Eddie Murphy's ""Vampire in Brooklyn"" which also fails to strike the right mood throughout. Technically speaking, ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It"" is surprisingly good - see the dancing party scene, for instance - but the whole events there are just bland. Count Dracula dances gracefully, and then he escapes breaking the window. Nothing great, funny or otherwise, happens here just like the rest of the film itself.

All the cast including Leslie Nielsen with his silly antics are amusing to see, but there is not much else in ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It.",2.0
"Sweet little movie, however comedy is far to simple and arbitrary for my taste. One thumb down.",2.0

"Two of the rules that I have developed over the past 10 years for picking good movies and which have yet to be disproven are:

1. Don't bother watching any Mel Brooks films made after Blazing Saddle; and

2. Don't watch any Leslie Neilson comedies that aren't directed by the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team.

Unfortunately, since there was nothing else on TV, I broke my own rules, and this film proves that both rules are still applicable. Mel Brooks has degenerated from clever satires with silly, but well-done scenes, to just plain bad silliness. Like all non-ZAZ Neilson comedies, Brooks' later films, Space Balls and beyond, all come off as badly done attempts to imitate Airplane! that just don't work. They all come off as purely juvenile drivel without the wit or directoral talents of the ZAZ team who know the importance of timing and deadpan delivery to good silly movies.  It is sad that such brilliant people as Brooks and Neilson have taken to making suc! h unfunny, childish garbage.

Get a good Brooks film like High Anxiety, Blazing Saddles or the Producers, or get a good Neilson film like Airplane (1 only) or the Naked Gun movies instead.",2.0
"I'd never seen this 1949 film.  And there it was, beckoning me from the shelf of the New York Public Library.  There are some urban myths about John Wayne but I don't remember any of his films.

So, hey, a long weekend was coming up.  I thought I might give it a try.

This story is about the U.S. Cavalry shortly after the Civil War.  General Custer and his men have just been slaughtered.  The Indians are uprising.  John Wayne, a gray-haired widower who visits his wife's grave regularly, is in command of a fort in the territory. In less than a week he will be forced into retirement. A romantic triangle exists between Joanne Dru and two of the enlisted men. She's visiting the fort but because danger is imminent, she and her aunt have to be escorted to where she can get a stagecoach.  So she goes out on patrol with the men.

I kept waiting for something to happen.  There was no real high drama.  Very little conflict.  John Wayne becomes the hero because he stops an Indian war by chasing away their horses.  Everything seems very unlikely.  And silly.  It was hard to keep watching because I was totally bored.  I guess John Wayne's performance was all right.  But I judge good performances on the subtlety of emotions displayed by the actors.  And John Wayne's performance was completely one-dimensional.

I've see old movies where the essentials of a good story are well told.  But, aside from the song, ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"", which has a catchy melody, this film just doesn't even make the playing field in my list of recommendations.

Don't waste your time with this one.  Just forgetaboutit!",2.0
"Watchable, but certainly not one of Ford or Wayne's best -- although very typical of their work together.

I would of course push you first toward ""The Searchers,"" but presumably you're aware of that immortal film.  Well, if you've gotta have one of Ford's ""cavalry"" movies, I would recommend instead ""Fort Apache,"" which can at least boast a memorable performance by Henry Fonda.

This particular movie is more of a straightforward Hollywood cowboys and Indians movie, without anything special to recommend it.

It's not awful, however.",2.0
"It is regretable that the producers of this DVD put in out in Full Screen (TV) format instead of Wide Screen format.  John Ford's  series of three pictures were shot in some of the most breathtaking scenery in America and chopping off the sides ruins much of the quality of this great film. IF you have to own a copy now then this might be worth it, but my recommendation is to wait for the Wide Screen edition to come out.",2.0
"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is great for the scenery, for some sense of the cavalry and for anyone who likes to see galloping horses and an old-fashioned bar-brawl in a film.  It is not exactly what you would call a psychological film however.  I found it surprisingly boring, considering its high acclaim and description as John Wayne's greatest acting feat.  The film has no depth:  the characters are very simplistic, hardly going beyond a two or three line description:  the handsome rival, the rich rival, the hard-drinking Irishman.  If you don't have a longing for the cavalry, you aren't going to enjoy this film.",2.0
"After being ressurrected by flaming dog urine, Freddy [Robert Englund] returns once more to haunt the remaining kids of Elm Street. This is the movie where the campiness begins to really take hold of the series. While Freddy is still entertaining, he's no longer as menacing as he was in the previous installments. This film is not a total waste as there are good special effects and a few thrills here and there and you can at least get through this one without falling asleep due to constant boredom. And although they do the best they can with the script they have, the cast of characters here are not up to par with the previous film's cast which sinks this film a little more and i do believe that this would be the last halfway decent Nightmare movie until New Nightmare as the quality of the series has begun to slip here and would only get worse for the next couple of movies. If you love all things Freddy or if you like cheesy 80's horror flicks, then give this movie a watch.",2.0
"Freddy comes back from the grave and starts killing off a bunch of teens including a kid that looks like Fat Albert.  This is a dark comedy and has some interesting imagery in the style of labrynth but not much.

The scene where the girl gets turned into a roach was disgusting and very creative. There is a scene where one of the guys gets turned into a part of a pizza and then he gets eaten by Freddy, that was funny.

This movie has no plot and has some lame scenes like when one of the kids turns into a karate kid and tries to fight off Freddy (yawn that was boring).

There is not too much violence and gore in this one.  The limited amount of gore in this movie is cheesy.
Also I like how Freddy has funny one liners.  I thought Freddy's Dead was a bit more interesting and wild than this one. I still have yet to see the other Elm street movies but when I do I will give a review on here.",2.0
"I bought this one recently because

I was a huge Freddy fan as a kid and

wanted to revise the ol' collection. But

being the Horror freak that I am, I

couldn't see this one as scary. I thought

it was O.K. Just a fun fantasy movie,

nothing Scary or morbid. Buy this one if

you want a good chuckle. Not to be terrified.

The 1st and 2nd Nighmare movies are the best. Dark,

Spooky, scary, gothic, morbid, gross, bloody etc.

Parts 4, 5, Freddy's Dead and A New Nightmare

are just trying Wayyy too hard to keep the

franchise going. In fact I never ever saw the last two

installments until just recently because I thought

back then they'd 'be

cheesy'. My thoughts were correct, I couldn't even

finish watching them.",2.0
"I am a big Freddy fan, if you don't beleive me, read my reviews on the other Frederick films, but this one is defentally the most over-rated. It's a shame really, because you get ones like number 2 and 5 which, in my opinion, are under-rated, and much better than this one.
  The main characters of this film really shift places half way through. At the begining, and for about the first half hour, the main character is the surviver from number 3, Christene. Then she...well, you know. So then it's her best friend, Alice.
  The story of the film has Freddy, once again, rising from his grave (he's revived by a dog's flaming urine. I know, it's in a dream, but I think it's even a little too far fetched for that). Basically, he finishes off all that's left of the children of the lynch mob that killed him, which is only three. But now he want's to invade the dreams of the ""new"" children of Elm Street, and start his reighn of terror all over again. We basically find out that he can't just come in their dreams like before, but that he firstly needs ""someone"" to bring them to him. That's when Alice, the dream master, steps in. She unwilingly brings Freddy new victims by falling asleep, so whenever she shuts her eyes, someone bites it. Now that's what you call a hard life!
  Now as I said in my review for number 3 Freddy became more comedic from then on, but this one really takes the michael. Freddy ain't scary at all anymore, Robert Englund's lines are almost all taken up with jokes.
  I'm sorry, but I can't see why this one made the most money at the box office, I really can't. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's just not good, either. If the word ""average"" was made for any film, this was that film. Yes, visually it is good, but I'm sorry, that just doesn't save it for me. All the acting from the teenagers is pretty average. Again, though, like before, Robert Englund is a lot of fun. This guy really knows how to play a wise-cracking pyschopath.
  So, I'm sorry to say, don't believe all the hype, this film don't deserve it.",2.0
A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is not very good in my opinion. The plot gets cheesy and very unrealistic to the point of boredum.

Don't be fooled, this is still a real bore!",2.0
O.k so Nightmare 3 was good but when 4 came along I was not suprised when I was not intrigued. It was o.k. I think it gets a bit stupid when they keep pulling each other into their dreams. It is neither scary or as  original as the others. One bit which I though was good was when the main  character is in her class. She falls asleep as does her friend and  BANG...heres FREDDY!. O.k movie. Give it go if you liked the other  Nightmare movies. Just don't expect to be scared.,2.0
"The serious 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series ended with Part 3, in which Freddy's past was revealed, the survivors of the original film were killed and Freddy was laid to rest.  If the films had finished there and then they  would have done so on a high note.
But then the powers-than-be at New  Line Entertainment decided Freddy was too much of a cash cow to dispose of  and so more films were made.  However, these newer films (apart from the  superb 'New Nightmare') are strictly at comedy level.  Part 4:The Dream  Master, despire boasting good camerawork and interesting special effects,  is a non-event, no more than a series of set-pieces strung together by a  very weak storyline.  A new would-be victim is given the power to bring  others into dreams by Kristen, whose character seems to have changed  completely and who is completely miscast.  Freddy, given top billing in the  opening credits, is ludicrously over-the-top and the characters we're  supposed to care about are so smug and irritating it's a relief when they  die in horror comic-book fashion.
Gaudy, show-offy and quite uninspiring.",2.0
"An okay movie, seen it twice now. Starts off well enough but by the second half it really fizzles out and I just stop caring. To me, and this is a big problem in the movie, is that it doesn't really grab you the way it should because it doesn't go deep enough into characterization, and it doesn't really show the viewer his rise to the top. Instead It kind of glosses over potentially interesting and important things to keep the plot and timeline moving. We literally go from the 50's to the 90's in this movie. That's not a particularly easy way to tell a story, especially with many of the same actors, but you'll notice they use quite a few tricks to make it seem like a substantial amount of time has gone by. But even though it's no easy task it still tries to cram too much in and it really suffers for it. I found it tough to care about most of the characters because there's just too much going on and at the same time not enough. It just doesn't go deep enough.

The acting overall was fairly good with Depp and Liotta standing out. Penelope Cruz or whoever she is (not familiar with her) was absolutely dreadful, she was over acting like crazy. Overall I feel like if the movie had about 30 minutes added on with some tweaks to script it could've been better and more fleshed out. As it stands it's not a bad flick by any stretch of the imagination, but in the world of crime movies it would rank very low with me.",2.0

"As George Jung, Johnny Depp dons long blonde hair, a Boston accent and dark glasses. He portrays a man, who fearing poverty as a boy, makes all the wrong choices in obtaining wealth - first as a marijuana importer and finally as the kingpin in the rise of the cocaine empire.  Because he is a decent sort of fellow, not a monster, he is ousted by his Latin American contacts and winds up three times in prison, where he remains today, serving a sixty year sentence, until his planned release in 2015.

It isn't until 42 minutes into the two hour film that cocaine even enters the picture (suggested by his cell mate during his first stay in prison, once he learns of George's marijuana empire). Jordi Molla as the cell mate, Diego, delivers the best performance in the film. He is riveting in all of his guises as friend, confidante, opportunity provider, and ultimate betrayer.  Equally good in support are Rachel Griffiths as George's loud mouthed, bitter mother and Ray Liotta as his long loving and long suffering father - a poignant betrayal.

Unfortunately, the film has little value other than providing a history lesson in the rise of cocaine as an underworld marketing empire.  TRAFFIC is an interesting companion film to see.  Depp is most affecting in his last scenes, now sporting a paunch and dirty long hair, delusionally expecting his daughter's visit, an event which never occurs.

The problem with the film in my opinion is that it lacks tension - it is too matter of fact.  We never see George's ambition - he is always too calm about everything that happens to him, good and bad.  We care about him but we don't engage with his character.  It is a marketing lie to show Penelope Cruz as his co-star. She doesn't appear in the film until the second half and then only in a few scenes as his second wife, a foul-mouthed five letter word.

To sum up, it's a valuable history lesson but not great film.",2.0
"I bought this the other day on a whim at a garage sale.

First off, a technical matter:  where the hell is the closed captioning on this DVD?  I have a hard time understanding what's being said unless I can also read someone's lips.  On a 14"" TV, that's not always possible.  Thus, I appreciate closed captioning. I am sure deaf people do too.  This is the first DVD I've seen in a long time that does not include it in the standard features, or if it does, I sure as hell couldn't find it.

Second, the movie itself:  at a certain point I lost all sympathy for George Jung.  You can root for a small-time pot dealer who is in cahoots with a stewardess to smuggle marijuana cross-country.  Even as his greed gets the best of him, nobody's getting killed, nobody's dying of overdoses.  But it's hard to have much sympathy for a character who works for a drug lord who shot a man in cold blood at the ""job interview.""

Jung knew firsthand the damage cocaine was doing to his friends' and wife's health.  He saw with his own eyes the damage it was doing to innocent people in Columbia.  He wasn't just an addict without the willpower to stop himself from doing another line.  He was running the largest drug-smuggling ring in the country.

Boo hoo.  He lost his daughter's trust when he didn't show up to take her to California.  That trip wasn't meant to make Kristina Jung happy, it was to prove to himself that he was at heart a good dad.

This is one of those movies that irritates me precisely because it could have been excellent.  I don't mean that it should have become an anti-drug screed (few things are more tiresome than those), but it could have been vastly improved by the director and screenwriter having more emotional distance from Jung.  The problem is not that Jung believes the things he tells himself about himself, it is that Ted Demme does too.

Also, I have yet to see a movie with Penelope Cruz in it in which she does not completely annoy me.",2.0
"This film seemed to drag out for hours and hours.  When you find the occasional high point in this film, where you can be mildly entertianed, it ends to quickly and you are thrust back into the world of monotany that makes up 90 percent of this film.  Johnny Depps acting was good, and his portrayal of the character was good, but this movie just seemed to never go anywhere.  Never exciting, never thrilling, you feel like you're just watching hours worth of random consecutive events of some man's life.  The ending of the movie is heartbreaking, and the message that his father give him becomes cruelly ironic all throughout the film, but i cant give credit to the filmakers for either of those thigns because they were real facts, not anything the directors thought up.  Overall, just plain BLAND",2.0
"Johnny Depp plays George Jung, a drug dealer who became responsible for a big part of the cocaine traffic in the US. This picture tells his life`s story, presenting the processes and changes he went through, living wild and risky experiences which didn`t seem to have a big purpose.
Similar material has been shown in a more original, interesting way in some Martin Scorece`s movies, and director Ted Demme eveen creates a couple of scenes that bring the master to mind. However, ""Blow"" lacks a point, it`s never that engaging and doesn`t have great moments or sequences to deliver, becoming tiresome and too long.
Also, it`s a movie that relies more in style (camera angles, soundtrack, clothes) than in substance, never developing its characters beyond two-dimensional figures that don`t make us care about their fate. Even Penlope Cruz, who plays Jung`s wife, doesn`t have much to do here apart from talking loud and looking sexy. The results are just average, offering a shade of what it could have been if handled properly. As it is, ""Blow"" is just a little sketch and not a big explosion as its title suggests.",2.0
"This is a story of a ""good boy"" turned into a big drug dealer, including all the usual elements- the way up, the pretty wife, the cars, the riches, the betrayal of a good friend and then all the way down. Sounds familiar? Yes, you have seen it in ""Scar face"" and other movies of the same kind, only there the story was more interesting; Cruel maybe, but with some reasoning - you could understand the motives behind the actions of the heroes (be it to advance, to prove their power, to control) and you got immersed in the logic of the drug world.  This movie on the other hand is neither convincing in its logic or characters nor presented in an interesting manner. Contrary to what we expect the movie is also non violent and this fact (which in other cases could have been appreciated by me) makes it not credible, or rather covering up the truth more then disclosing as we know the events have truly happened.
George, the `good boy"", played by Johnny Depp is presented as some kind of tragic hero. Someone who got involved in ""bad things"" but really just wanted to live in peace and quiet with his family...The only explanation we get for his turn to crime was that his mom always used to nag his dad for money...Everything his dad earned was not enough. George then promised himself that he will always have money.
George gets into the drug business as if by mistake, just to earn some quick money for him and his friends (""these were great days""...he says with nostalgia). He was the mind behind the group of good kids and devises techniques of drug delivery while using his girlfriend Barbara as a carrier. The drugs are sold to other ""good kids"" from universities and colleges and the techniques of drug delivery grows more sophisticated as there is rise in demand. We never get to see the ""end customers"" or the final sale process which I assume could have been interesting to watch. Barbara dies from cancer (""I really loved her"") and George starts making big money by joining with the Boss, the famous Escobar, a symbol of the drug world and its corruption. However, not in this movie... The drug world presented here is clean of violence. The Colombian farmers are nave and nice and even the scene with Escobar is quite mellow, besides maybe one shot.  In George's jail periods we learn about the qualities of cocaine (good cocaine melts only in 86 degrees) but these facts seem to be the only gain from this movie.
I have just seen Johnny Depp as a charming Pirate in the new film ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" where he just shines through - here however, except for his beauty there are no signs of the famous Depp magic. Here his beauty is not enough to save his role from total shallowness. His gestures and facial expressions are void of any true feelings.
Penelope Cruz who plays the beautiful wife is one of my favorite actresses. However, I have to admit that even she does a lousy job here. Maybe it's not her fault as her role is of the spoiled rich wife who does nothing but be pretty and smoke drugs - however, her part is a pale replica of the part Michelle Pfeiffer does in scar face and she does not manage to look convincing, nor is it clear what besides her looks, drew George to her. Penelope Cruz hardly appears in the movie and I did not appreciate the fact that her picture is the one appearing on the cover of this movie. Ray Liota and Rachel Griffiths play George's parents, and although Ray Liota is convincing as the father, the mother seems the same age as her son and she does not seem to bring anything to this role.
I must confess that in several parts this movie seems like an ""ordered movie"" to clean the name of George Jung or at least present him in a human light as the movie is so one sided and unconvincing. In the end we see George in prison, waiting and hoping that his daughter would come to visit... the movie is filled with manipulations such as this one who are meant to make you feel sorry for this man.",2.0
"Johnny Depp gives an interesting performance as George Jung in ""Blow,"" but I didn't like this film, nor did I understand its points. Was I supposed to care for Jung? His actions brought about the deaths of thousands and ushered in the current state of drugs in America. He lived in decadence by helping others ruin their lives. He lost his money, and he kept making mistakes, getting involved with drug trade when he should've gotten out of it.
The film seems, to me, to want you to sympathize with Jung, yet, as a viewer, you cannot. He is not a hero.
When he loses his daughter in the end, it's not sad. It's fitting.
Ted Demme, who died one year after directing this, created an interesting film, but it's one that seems to make a hero out of a man who doesn't fit the mold.",2.0

"While the acting, directing, and general storytelling was solid, I thought the movie was little more than a heavy-handed morality play disguised as a self-indulgant biographical expos. Truth is, I just didn't find the characters interesting or sympathetic and the ending made me groan. They probably got funding from the US government to present the anti-drug moral lesson.",2.0
"Coming as it does so hot on the heels of the brilliant, multi-leveled ""Traffic,"" ""Blow"" emerges as a superficial, shallow and second-rate survey of the drug-dealing world.  Spanning close to five decades, the film chronicles the true-life account of one George Jung, a hotshot cocaine trafficker from the 1970's who is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for his crimes.
Very little about this film feels original or authentic, as it travels a dramatic arc that seems totally predictable for films of this genre (""Traffic,"" by the way, did NOT follow this path).  We start with George's unhappy home life growing up in Massachusetts in the 1960's, then it's onto his introduction to drug selling on the beaches of California, his trips to Colombia for meetings with the famous drug cartel leader, Pablo Escobar, his seemingly endless arrests, imprisonments and releases from prison and finally, of course, his too-late realization that the only thing of any value in his life is his little daughter whose life he is managing to screw up in a royal way.
The early days of his ""career"" - when he is just a young punk making his connections and getting his feet wet in the ""glamorous"" world of the burgeoning late-60's drug culture - are dramatized on screen with tedious predictability.  Even the youthful looking Johnny Depp may be getting a bit long-in-the-tooth to be portraying a late teen, early twenty-something beach bum.  The film picks up a little dramatic energy when George is introduced to Escobar, but this aspect of the film is dropped almost immediately in order to concentrate on the tiresome interpersonal backstabbing between George and a number of his drug-running cronies.  I realize that this is supposed to be based on a true story, but it is still a shame when the movie ends up having to downplay and eventually even jettison the one subplot that carries with it at least some dramatic validity.  Equally uninteresting is George's relationship with his wife, Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a stereotypical cocaine-snorting, Latina sexpot, more concerned with her drug supply than with her husband and daughter.  The filmmakers even try to draw some heavy-handed parallels between George's family (weak but loving father, emasculating, self-centered mother) and the family he has formed with his own wife and daughter.
The biggest failure of the film comes in its clunky attempts to make George into some kind of admirable, sympathetic figure.  Fully the last half hour of the film is spent showing us just what an ""innocent victim of circumstance"" George turns out to be.  Even when he is trying his damnedest to go straight, the vagaries of fate keep conspiring against him to draw him back into the world of crime and prison.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him because he can't seem to get his life together well enough to be able to raise the daughter he so obviously loves.  Yet, when he is finally given the chance to prove his love to her by supporting her and her mother financially, what does he end up doing but arranging for yet another (and in this case abortive) drug deal.  It is one thing to provide us with an emotionally complex, morally ambiguous character.  It is quite another to expect us to feel pity for a man whose modus operandi is that of sheer stupidity.  All our empathy for the character ends up flying out the window and all we can do basically is to feel that the character got what was coming to him.
As George, Johnny Depp seems to be sleepwalking through the part, although it may not be entirely his fault.  Writers Bruce Porter and David McKenna and director Ted Demme never establish that feeling of explosive dramatic intensity so crucial to a film of this nature.  In fact, for a film dealing with the dangerous world of drug trafficking, ""Blow"" seems to just sit there lackadaisically on the screen for most of its duration, devoid of energy, tension and drama. Needless to say, ""Blow"" ain't no ""Traffic.""",2.0
"Putting it quite simply, Blow blew. While I greatly admire Johnny Depp, and think he has amazing talent as an actor, not even he, nor any of the other talented supporting cast members, could save this piece of garbage. The movie plods along slowly, without any real purpose. Sure, there are some fun scenes along the way, but the movie doesn't seem to have a real point. I'm not going to tell anyone not to watch it; everyone should form their own opinions. But I'd definitely suggest renting it before splurging on a DVD.",2.0
"This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir, and it presents an interesting point or two, but everything in this film has been covered before, in better films.",2.0
"Based on the book: Blow: How a Small-Town Boy Made 100 million with the Medllin Cocaine Cartel and Lost is All' by Bruce Porter, Blow is an overly familiar, overly slick, docu-drama of  real life legendary drug dealer George Jung's life. It's a second rate cable movie with Johnny Depp added to upgrade the package.  The film seems all set up to be an interesting character study, but the character is too bland to be very interesting and everything about the story is overly familiar.  The few opportunities the film sets up are squandered beneath the stylistic re-treads and multiple montages that we've seen used much more effective in films like: Scorcese's Good Fellas and Casino;  in De Palma's Scarface and in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights.
However, you might find enough redeeming value in the film's good performances which include worthwhile work from Ray Liotta, Johnny Depp, Cliff Curtis (who too briefly plays Escobar) and  Franka Potente (the Run Lola Run star making her American feature film debut here).  If you can somehow overlook all of the recycled ideas borrowed from the Scorcese/Tarantino/Anderson/De Palma stylistic tricks and homage to great directors of the past book... you might not find the film the pointless waste of time that I found it to be.
That said the DVD does have some much better than average extras, the documentary on the effects of cocaine on Colombia is very well done, the interview with currently imprisoned real life George Jung are among the highlights.
If the subject matter , the rise and fall of drug dealer holds any interest, the extras on the disc are definitely worth seeing.  In fact the extras are far more interesting and compelling than the film is itself.  You can watch the extras integrated into the film via the Infini-film gimmick (previously used in the 13  Weeks, and 15 minutes DVD's) or Separately accessible via the menu options.

"As great as the movie is (which is pretty great) and the booklet and ornament, I am very disappointed that one of the bonus features has been dropped, namely the Frank Capra remembrance feature. I bought this version of the movie because it had this extra feature on it and was cheaper on Amazon than it was in the store. However, when it came, there was a giant sticker over the back of the box, replicating the original box, except no longer listing the remembrance feature. You can even still see the old box, where it is listed, underneath. Why this was done, I don't know, but it makes for an extremely disappointing purchase.",2.0
"When I first rented this movie, I did so because I thought it was a musical, please try to hold your laughter. It had a score by Noel Coward, so what was I suppose to think? Granted this cast is not a musical bunch lol, but, you never know! lol. Directed by Stanley Donnen, no doubt best known for directing ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Grass Is Greener"" has a ""staged"" feel to it. The acting is good, after all, look at this cast. How could it not be great! But, the story leaves something to be desired, mainly just a hint of realism. I understand this is suppose to be a sweet romantic story, that is probably suppose to be anything but real, but just a hint of realism could of make this work. C'mon lets be honest. What man would react to the same situation Grant finds himself in? You see his wife Deborah Kerr runs off with Robert Mitchum. And Grant is perfectly understanding. He never makes an attempt to go after her. She lies to Grant and just goes with Mitchum. The one thing I hate most about movies like this is. If it was a man that ran off with another women, no one would find it romantic. Women would bash him for what he did. But, when a women runs away with another man, all of a sudden it's romantic. Is something wrong with this picture? You bet! This has a sloppy script, and unbelievanle characters. Redeeming moments are the use of Noel Coward's music, the acting, and Donnen's directing. If you want to see a better movie with Kerr and Grant, get ""An Affair to Remember"". Much, much better then this! ** 1\2 out of *****",2.0

"I probably should have given it just one star, but Hate is such a strong word. So the 2 stars go toward production values and the costumes.
It's a ridiculous premise that borrows heavily from much better films (regarding dialogue and mannerisms) but it really goes nowhere. You would not only have to suspend disbelief to imagine Kerr choosing Mitchum over Grant, you'd have to practically throw your sensibilities over a cliff. I was never especially a fan of Robert Mitchum as a romantic lead, and here he's stiff, choppy and unsympathetic. His character less charm than a wooden puppet. He plays an overbearing, rich, rude American who manipulates his way into the private section of a tourist attraction estate and we are supposed to believe that the elegant Deborah Kerr is immediately intrigued and infatuated with him.

Meanwhile, her husband, played by Cary Grant, pads about in comfortable home attire and is still 10 times as sophisticated as the expensively dressed Mitchum. Jean Simmons appears to be there to even out the numbers and to provide some comic relief. Her character is just as shallow as Mitchum's but I had to wait until the very end for this inevitability.

I don't know how it was determined that it was a comedy because I didn't see anything funny about it.  It sure wasn't an appropriate movie for immature and/or emotional women to watch, as they would sure learn how to behave badly.  I can't think of anything good to say about it.  I am really surprised that it has such a high rating.",2.0
"Love the movie itself, but this version by Paramount requires the viewer to watch a lengthy trailer for a modern movie every time you put in the disc.  Very frustrating.",2.0
"This entire film is a thinly veiled discourse justifying the infidelity of husbands as the natural course of marital events, and not a very good one. It wouldn't make any difference if the script were clever, but alas...

The plot attempts at wit by giving the infidelity to the wife, then showing how a reasonable (man) husband would behave in the circumstance.  The set up is that Deborah Kerr has a great marriage with her loving and attentive husband, Cary Grant, but when Robert Mitchum takes an intentional wrong turn on a tour of their home (their main source of income), she immediately falls in love with him, and begins an affair

His character is repeatedly asked throughout the film if he cheated, but refuses to answer such an irrelevant question.  Grant even has a line explaining this is the reason why wives wear rings and husbands don't. Kerr's character is a the stereotypically ditzy (woman) wife who doesn't know what she wants until a man shows her, or there is money involved (she initially tells Mitchum to leave, but then invites him for tea after learning he's a millionaire).

The film tries very hard to be clever but never quite makes it, lacks likable characters or believable situations, drags out too long, and is even missing pivotal scenes (Mitchum & Grant talk after the fact about the recourse Grant's character decides to take, but we don't actually get to see him bring it up!)

If you want a fun and clever film about infidelity with Cary Grant, I would recommend Indiscreet.",2.0

"Yes, the cast in wonderful and the dialogue witty, but geez- the sheer casual amorality of this movie left me disgusted. Adultery is treated here as a jolly fun thing- fashionable even. Cary Grant's character wins back his wife by letting her have her fun while simultaneously letting her know that he loves her and would welcome her back. How modern! How liberal! How revolting!",2.0
Not a good Cary Grant movie. Good actors but not what you would expect. Too long and dragged out. Love Cary Grant but not in this movie.,2.0

"Cary Grant almost makes this terrible film worth seeing. He manages to bring his style and class, not to mention his very good looks, to this role of a befuddled English earl who is fighting to keep his wife.  The wife is played by the wonderful Deborah Kerr but she is terribly miscast.  Ms. Kerr reeks of integrity and intelligence and cannot convince the audience that she could possible be silly enough to fall in love with a brash American millionaire, Robert Mitchem, in ten minutes. What intelligent sensible woman could risk her happy marriage with Cary Gtant for a fling with Robert Mitchem?  Maybe he smells good or exudes theramones or something that we cannot see in this film.

The whole plot rests on this flimsy occurrence, and if anyone has bothered to read the title of the film, we know how it will end up.  It might be fun to see the plot unfold, but it really isn't.  The Jean Simmons character is meant to liven up the story a little but just acts silly.  The butler, Sellars, does the best job.  But that isn't enough.  Robert Mitchem is a great film presence and I have enjoyed his performances a lot but here he's just a big rich oaf.

Not only is the plot absurdly lame but the last part is terribly talky.  Maybe when the film was made, this passed for wit but it is now just tedious and boring.

What a waste of lovely actors!",2.0
"The plot of this movie is as stupid as stupid gets:  brash American boy meets married English girl, and charms the pants off her in 15 minutes, despite the fact that she and her husband have a warm, loving relationship.  The husband then challenges the brash American to a duel to save his marriage.  It's even worse when you consider that the brash charmer is Robert Mitchum (a man who exudes menace), and the abandoned husband is Cary Grant, the world's most charming man.  And Jean Simmons as the flighty, eccentric former girlfriend/best friend is just wasted.

All that said, however, the movie is really all about the dialogue, which is very clever and thoroughly enjoyable.  If you can get past the ridiculous plot and the fact that you keep waiting for Robert Mitchum to beat someone to death, then you will like this movie.",2.0
"Seriously, I didn't even think that this was a comedy until I came here and saw people saying ""it wasn't funny.""  I got it as part of a boxed set of Cary Grant films (purchased here), and it's the only dud of the lot.

There was one scene that, I will grant you, was light and entertaining.  Not laugh out loud, but funny enough (I won't spoil it by saying which one).  Aside from that, the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity.

Most of all, you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne.  Grant and Simmons, in particular, are strong - but their efforts are ultimately squandered.  Bob Mitchum is OK, but generally miscast, and Kerr's beauty and talent are basically wasted.  No amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here.  She goes from happily married to tramp in about 5 minutes, for no discernible reason.

"Poor transfer. A great deal of the sound is trash. Parts sound as if they were recorded from inside a toilet a couple dozen yards away. Dialogue is occasionally unintelligible. I understand that the video quality was never great to begin with, but this transfer improves upon what is there. It is the audio, however, that wrecks this release. Bear in minds that I am referring to the 30th anniversary transfer, not one of the others.

I hope the film will be remastered for 4K release. It's an awful movie, you realize, once you're no longer the same kid who saw this in theaters. The 80's had a lot of terrible films we loved, because we were kids and we were stupid. But it does take you back, for better or for worse.

The Amazon listing DID NOT STATE IT WAS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT - if it HAD, I'd NEVER have rented it.  We scrolled the mouse to fast-forward, and there were the same extra scenes from the Director's Cut!  Awful.  I feel gypped, my money is gone, and our movie night ruined.  Thanks, Amazon.

The leads are all pretty one dimensional aside from Sean Connery, but even he is confined. The action sequences are not so impressive that they should have had to settle for bad acting.

As a songwriter and performer, Diamond's career has been brilliant, but you wouldn't know it from the songs he wrote and performed in this movie. Several songs are gushy and over the top, while others seem totally unrelated to the film.

"Those scenes cut from the original theatrical release were left out for a reason: they do nothing to advance the story.  The rule of thumb when editing a written story--and should be for films as well--is cut out anything that doesn't help to move the story along.  Those deleted scenes should be left in the special features category where they belong and not re-added to the film and in this case it bogs things down, drags out scenes longer than they need to be,  more or less the same affect as trying to sail a boat that someone forgot to pull the anchor up.
Another problem, at least with my copy, is the audio is horrible.  Sound effects and sound track are blaringly loud while we could hardly understand the dialog at all. In some scenes the actors sounded as if their mouths were stuffed with cotton balls.  I was constantly adjusting the volume in an effort to hear what the actors were saying and to keep from being blasted out the front window by the soundtrack.
Most disappointing of all is my fiance had never seen it and I had been going on about what a great movie this was.  So I felt bit embarrassed having crowed about this film the way I did only to see her losing interest less than half way through. But who could blame her?  Between the story being bogged down by pointless re-added scenes and the horrible audio it was barely holding my attention as well.

"Detail-wise and depth-of-image-wise, this Blu-Ray improves on the Silver Anniversary Edition DVD that I previously owned (and which I gave to my sister after acquiring the BD). I wasn't happy about losing the extra feature on Frank Capra that was on the DVD, but life is short.

This BD generally cleans up the picture we've all seen over the years into a steadier and more-detailed version. However, there are MAJOR problems with the transfer: DNR has been over-employed which adds a glassy look to certain scenes. There's a really bad vertical scratch mark running along the right edge of the film that starts when the now-repentant George Bailey returns to the bridge to pray for help. That scratch runs pretty much through the final 9 minutes of the film, and it's impossible to ignore as one tries to watch the movie as the scratch flickers and changes position. I don't remember that scratch in previous issues, so it's REALLY disappointing to see it on the BD. It's also disappointing to read so many 5-star reviews of this BD, none of which mention these glaring and obvious faults. One wonders if the reviewers even bothered to watch the BD before reviewing.

As others have noted, this package includes both the original B&W and the colorized versions of the film. The scratch I mentioned is very visible in the colorized version as well, though the digital manipulation is less stark in the colorized version than the original B&W.

I suppose this is the BD version we're stuck with until someone at Paramount decides to spruce up the film correctly...which is to say, fix the damn picture! To date, Paramount's efforts have been restricted to gussying up the packaging: first, in 2009, with the BD case wrapped in a sparkling O-ring, and then again in 2011, when they threw in an ornament and some other useless crap in a ""Gift Box"" edition. Both versions include the problematic 2009 mastering discussed herein.

"I was looking forward to this movie.  I watched some of the series years ago and thought this would be a great flick, especially with the incomparable Connery.  Who cannot help but fantasize about the gift of immortality and the inevitable knowledge it brings?  However, I was certainly disappointed with this this film.

It's so 80's and clich.  The only thing it's missing is breakdancing by 400 year old immortals.  The production quality is poor, but I suppose it's well before the age of big budget films.  I just feel there is far more that could have been done with character development or historical value.  Even the combat scenes are a joke!  There are fireworks ever time one of their swords touched metal.  Maybe we were all coked up idiots in the 80s and thought this kind of nonsense was cool.  It doesn't seem that way to me now.

It's a cool idea for a story, but it's dated and executed poorly by 2013 standards.  I suppose that it's destined to be resurrected with modern cinematography.

"This is what happens when musicians (at least most of them) foray into fields in which they should not trod.  I had the great fortune of seeing Neil Diamond ""live"" shortly after the release of this movie and, like always, he brought down the house.  He just may be one of the greatest entertainers who ever graced a concert stage.  As a singer-songwriter, they don't make 'em better (Remember that he honed his craft during the golden age of the late 60's at the famous Brill Building in New York City where artists such as Carole King & Gerry Goffin, Howard Greenfield & Neil Sedaka and Phil Spector (to name just a few) were also honing THEIR crafts).  The point is that Mr. Diamond is second to none in the field of Rock/Pop Music and the day he stops recording and entertaining will be the music industry's huge loss.

As for this movie - Let me just say this:  If you take away the music sequences, what you have left is some of the most horrible stuff ever seen on film.  This movie is so inept that even a legend like Lawrence Olivier (who plays Cantor Rabinovich, Mr. Diamond's jewish father)stinks.  His acting is so 'hammy' that it's embarrasing.  I mean, when he blurts out ""I hef no son!"" after realizing that his son (Mr. Diamond)  is sleeping with Ms. Arnaz, I lost it!  And Lucie Arnaz?  Oh my!!  How about ""I DON'T Love Lucy""?  Her acting is so amateurish that it's hard not to giggle.  And this 25th Anniversary edition dvd is not that impressive, either.  The picture quality is poor (very grainy).  The sound quality is very good, though, but the DTS will not be appreciated unless you have the surround sound system to accommodate it.  My advice is wait for a year or so until this movie comes down to $9.99 (which it will) - Even though it does have some fine extras, it just isn't worth the current price.  The best part of the film?  The ""Songs of Life"" sequence.  A beautiful song and a touching moment in this otherwise awful film.",2.0
"A year ago I bought ""The Rose"" and wondered if Neil Diamond's bid for big-screen success ever made it to DVD.  Then I saw a used copy going, to my horror, for 54 freakin' bucks at a local music/video store.  Fortunately this rerelease came out without my taking the very silly plunge I am all too capable of.

I like Neil OK, but not so much that I could ever let myself give this four or five stars.  On the other hand, this movie is far from the disaster critics said it was.  Diamond is no, well, Laurence Olivier, but in my view does nothing so bad to deserve ""winning"" the Golden Raspberry award for Worst Actor of 1980.

As for Olivier, I gotta wonder why he did this movie.  I have to agree that his Yiddish accent is spotty at best.  Sometimes he successfully evokes the old men back in my synagogue, one of whom actually smacked my friend for mispronouncing some Hebrew while praying at my Bar Mitzvah.  (Good times.)  Other times the accent slides into something from Ren and Stimpy.  Also, his character and that of Neil's wife are so one-dimensional and humorless that ""Jess Robin""'s choice between his cantor past and the lure of pop stardom is telegraphed from the outset.  In my experience, Orthodox Jews can be exceptionally witty and multi-dimensional as well as rigid and disciplined.  You'd never know it from this script.

Much better written is Lucie Arnaz's role as a pushy, clever agent Neil meets in L.A. and falls in love with.  She is definitely the life of the movie.

Nice little moments:  unspoken awkwardness when Arnaz proudly presents Diamond with a ham dinner he can't eat; Olivier reaching up to kiss the Mezuzah absent from Neil's L.A. doorway.  Scary little moments:  ""partying"" with Franklin Ajaye and homies with a song about...the Robert E. Lee!; the bearded, whiskey-bent and heck-bound Neil running off to wow the yahoos in a COUNTRY & WESTERN bar (big song:  ""You Are My Sunshine""!)

Of course, the best scene is when Olivier tears his clothes and cries out the Hebrew prayer of mourning when he finds Neil living with shiksa Arnaz.

Watch for Paul Nicholas, then only 2 years removed from his own Top 10 hit ""Heaven On the 7th Floor"", as a prissy pop star, and Ernie Hudson as Neil's antagonist in a really cringeworthy scene in the early going.

But don't watch for jazz.  There's not a note of it to be found here.  But ""The Pop Singer"" wouldn't have the same ring to it now, would it?",2.0
"I love this movie.  I used to own it on VHS and it was great.

Something is wrong with the audio when Republic Pictures transferred it to DVD.  Sometimes, the dialog is so soft it can barely be heard through the TV. If I turn the volume up to max on my TV, I can then hear the quiet scenes.  Then the I get blasted when the next scene starts.  It is a very difficult and frustrating version to watch.

As a caveat, I only used my TV speakers to watch the video.  It is possible that a good home theater system with surround will play fine.",2.0
"Like a walking, talking cliche, this is a quintessentially bad '80s blockbuster; loaded with lousy dialog, telegraphed twists and cheesy, overproduced fight sequences, it's a nonstop parade of nimiety. That's not to say it's without allure - in fact, the terribly dated references to the era's pop culture and filmmaking techniques are half the fun of sitting down with it today. The world was a completely different place thirty years ago, and though we're doing so through a set of decidedly rose-tinted goggles, it's fun to look back on it in this way. Plus, buried beneath the film's sillier superficial aspects is a startlingly bright, thoughtful basic plot line dealing with love, loss and the kind of cold, calm emotional distance that any combination of the two will inevitable produce. A pity those deeper, more interesting developments don't enjoy half the investigation they probably deserve, but perhaps that's why the film fueled so many sequels. Sean Connery shines like a beacon amidst an otherwise-sleepwalking cast, which never recovers from his character's jolting premature exit.",2.0
"I can not believe some of the positive reviews on this site like the one below. This transfer is INEXCUSABLE for Blu-Ray. This fantastic movie deserved to be properly remastered. The sound was hallow and tinny. The picture quality was poor, appearing quite grainy. People can refer to that as a ""look"" or a ""style"" all they like, it is an excuse for a completely botched, poor transfer.",2.0
"I love sword-fighting movies, and this was probably the biggest one that I had not seen yet.  But after numerous recommendations by friends and coworkers, I got around to seeing this one on DVD, and came away from it unimpressed.  All the praises sung for it by others I considered letdowns.  For example, many others loved the Queen soundtrack.  I found it way of mark.  Half the movie took place in the Scottish highlands, and the movie would have came across better with Celtic folk music instead.  As for the swordplay, it is slow and does not compare to that found in Rob Roy, Braveheart, or the various Three Musketeer incarnations.  Probably the worst part of the movie was Sean Connery, who is Scottish, playing an Egyptian character, but with a Spanish name, Ramirez.  How ridiculous.  Good think I saw this on DVD and not at the theaters.",2.0
"This film feels like a bad 1950's B movie, although it is too earnest to achieve the cult status of many such films.

The story is entirely unbelievable, set, as it is, in 1979/80.  Who could really empathise with the dilemma facing Jess in his struggle for independence from tradition (at the callow age of 38 no less!)

There are three redeeming features.  Lucie Arnaz is very engaging in a thankless role.  Neil Diamond shows that, while he can't act at all, he has a very charismatic stage presence in his musical numbers.

The third redeeming feature is the soundtrack.  Neil Diamond shows that his songwriting skills are of a high quality.  The performances in the film enhance their impact.

Songs like America, Hey Louise, Summerlove, Love on the Rocks and Hello Again are populist and extremely well written.  You Baby, Acapulco, Robert E. Lee and others are pleasant surprises and together ensure, unusually for film soundtracks, that the music here can stand independently from the film.  This probabl;y explains why the soundtrack grossed more than the film on its original release.

All in all, I would say: rent the film, watch the bits where Lucie Arnaz is on screen and where Diamond is performing.  On that basis it is worth 4.5 stars.  If you insist on watching the whole thing, I give it two stars.",2.0
"Starting with September Morn, all of his CDs have been very uneven and this is one of the worst.  This has a couple of good songs on it (you know what they are) but the rest is REALLY BAD!!!  I wish they would put out Greatest Hits Vol. 3 with all of his  great songs since September Morn that aren't on Vol. 2 including That Kind, The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore, On The Way To The Sky, Right By You, The Drifter, First You Have to Say You Love Me, Front Page Story, Heartlight, In Ensanada, Turn Around, You Make It Feel Like Christmas, Sleep With Me Tonight, The Man You Need, Story of My Life, It Should Have Been Me, (I'll See You On The Radio) Laura, Me Beside You, Best Years of Our Lives, This Time, If I Couldn't See You Again, If There Were No Dreams, Don't Turn Around, Hooked On The Memory of You and a couple from Tennesse Moon and Three Chord Opera.  Now that would be an AWESOME CD and you wouldn't have to waste your hard-earned money on awful CDs like this with only 3 or 4 good songs!!!!",2.0
"I love Highlander. This is the first time I've seen the ""Director's Cut"" and I like it even more than the original theatrical release.

The major annoyance with the Blu-Ray version is the obvious change in picture quality between scenes. I'm sure this is due in part to the newly added ""Director's Cut"" scenes which have never been ""cleaned up"" in post-production for theatrical release. However, there are many scenes that are part of the original theatrical release that look horrible, worse than the VHS and DVD versions of the original Highlander that I have seen. Some of these scenes have horrible grain, are fuzzy, bad contrast, and bad color. Then other scenes look amazingly great, what you expect a Blu-Ray to look like. The picture quality seems to degrade with the darker scenes, which would be expected with the film stocks in use when Highlander was originally filmed. But this would not explain picture quality so bad that it is worse than the VHS version of the movie.

More should have been done to clean up the film in the transfer to Blu-Ray. While watching the movie I was constantly distracted by the changes in picture quality. It was like watching a 1080p high definition Blu-Ray one second and watching my first TV set (with rabbit ears) the next. This should have been a 5 star review but someone decided to get cheap in mastering this version of the film to Blu-Ray.",2.0
"This semi decent soundtrack is good as long as you haven't seen the movie... otherwise the schlock of the movie will make this CD of work a bitter pill to swallow, and your thoughts will be filled with terrible, terrible acting by Lucy Arnaz and Lawrence Olivier. I would suggest buying another Neil Diamond CD made before this one. The Diamond CDs only get worse as the years go on, and the Jazz Singer Soundtrack is the last listenable thing made by Neil Diamond. ""America"", ""Love on the Rocks"", ""Songs of Life"" and ""Summerlove"" are pretty good tunes. Those tunes make the disc worth owning for a hardcore fan.. However, ""You Baby"", ""Hey Louise"", ""Acapulco"", ""On The Robert E Lee"" and ""Jerusalem"" are utter garbage. ""Amazed and Confused"" is unlistenable. ""Adon Olom"" and ""Kol Nidre/My Name Is Yussel"" are just things put on the album to take up space. I would suggest Stones, Moods, or Greatest Hits over this..they are money well spent.. the Jazz Singer is not.",2.0
"If you are a fan of Neil Diamond's music, then you will no doubt enjoy this movie.
Purely as a movie, however, this isn't very good.  Cliched and schmaltzy, most of the scenes seem strung together as an excuse to fill time between musical numbers.  The story, as borrowed from the original Jolson film: son of a cantor wants to sing popular music instead of following in his father's footsteps.
Neither Diamond nor Arnaz are going to win Oscars anytime soon -- in fact, Diamond demonstrates that, as an actor, he's a heck of a singer.  The only shining performance in this movie is that of the incomparable Olivier, who proves that he can play any role given to him impeccably, no matter how dopey the surroundings.
If you are expecting any meat or substance to this movie, forget it.  The music IS good enough to sit through once, which is why it gets two stars from me, but the only reason I own it is because my wife simply adores Diamond's music.
Buy the soundtrack, if you like it, but I would avoid the film itself.  The DVD, meanwhile, is nothing special; the print is average at best, and there are no extra features worth discussing.",2.0
"After avoiding this film for years because the reviews were so negative, I finally watched it (because my fave-rave James Booth has a bit part in it as a record producer). I found it less terrible than people have said. Neil Diamond isn't a great actor, but he does a competent job, and Olivier is very entertaining with his coke-bottle eyeglasses and heavy accent.  (James Booth is a treat, as always, for the five minutes or so he's onscreen.  More!  More!)  The biggest plausibility problem, for me, had to do with the overnight success of Diamond's screen character.  With those songs?  And that (nonexistent) stage show?  Dream on.  (These comments are based on the VHS version, not the DVD.)",2.0
"The extended ""Director's"" aka ""International"" cut of the film is all well and good, but I am still looking for the original US theatrical cut of the film with the excellent pacing and the trimmed down story.

I know that DVD came out back in 1995 / 1996 when DVDs were still new and since then its never resurfaced.

I bought the Immortal Edition DVD in hopes of getting the US theatrical release as one might expect when something is billed as ""The Definitive Release of the film"".  Alas I was lied to and the US theatrical release was not present.

In the age of Bluray discs capable of 50GB or storage capacity, one would think that a disc containing both versions of the film was possible.  Apparently not...",2.0
"It's been the rare music superstar who doesn't turn their hand to at least one movie, and Neil Diamond is no exception.  ""The Jazz Singer"" is not a good film, either cinematically (Sir Laurence Olivier stated flat out that he did this one for the money) or musically (""Hello Again"" is pretty, but much of the rest of the soundtrack tries WAY too hard).  Diamond has a deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression for much of the movie, except when he's singing.  Olivier's over-the-top performance is a treat for cheese lovers, though, and Lucie Arnaz actually does a pretty good job.  Overall, though, if you're not a Neil Diamond fan (and even if you are), this film is pretty tough going.",2.0
"Guilty pleasure filmmaking at its finest. The story is as old as time, devoid of originality or insight. The acting is atrocious, even old salt Olivier. Ahh, but the music.....campy, overwrought, silly, yet compelling  as a train wreck.",2.0
"Highlander is one of those good ideas that never works because of disastrous directorial miscasting. Attention-seeking video director Russell Mulcahy seems almost perversely determined to make the wrong choice in almost every scene, whether its his obsessive use of inappropriate long lenses or his determination to make every shot so distinctive that he never notices that not only do the pictures often play against the intent of the scene but half the time the shots don't even match. He's not much good with actors either, constantly spinning off into clumsy broad comedy that undermines any threat or momentum, with Clancy Brown's evil Kurgan the main casualty as he is reduced to a tiresomely comical punk rocker. It may be the best of the series, but it's a long way from being even nearly as good as it could and should have been. One film that's practically crying out for a remake with a decent director.",2.0
"I liked the theatrical release a great deal, but the original DVD release with the black packaging sucks.  The video is nassty and grainy, the audio isn't well synched with the actors lips and the audio flutters and warbles throughout.  It's too much for me. It's like watching a dubbed Golden Harvest Kung Fu flick on worn VHS.  How could they release this and sell it, if not to make money on the remastered edition?",2.0
"I really like this movie.  I think it is a very beautifully shot, non-pretentious, interesting, and entertaining movie.  So why do the powers that be insist on splicing in a scene that looks and is acted so badly it stands out like a sore thumb?  It even has a jarring awful transition into the scene in a movie otherwise full of beautiful transitions.
If you don't know the story of this scene, here it is in brief.  The Director and Producers decided not to shoot the scene where Conner meets Rachael, to save some money.  During editing they changed their minds, and paid, out-of-pocket to set up and shoot that scene.  They called back Christopher Lambert and got some child actor and quickly slapped the scene together.  With the scene shot they went back to editing and spliced the footage in and decided it looked really bad and took it out again.
Fast forward to the release of the Directors-Cut and the only way to justify a Directors-Cut--by inserting this terrible footage.  Now I can't get a DVD version without this awful scene.
If this scene had been done properly (as in budgeted for, and done when Lamberts regular make-up person was there (I keep asking myself if this is what a person looks like on film with no make-up, or just with really really bad make-up), and if Lambert had felt like acting that day ) this could have been a very beneficial scene for the movie--but as it stands it's not.
I give the original release of Highlander 5 stars.  The current versions with all its ""improvements"" I can only give 2 stars.
All I wanted was a decent DVD transfer of the original movie.",2.0
"The director should put together a special edition style repolishing of this movie and gutting out Queen's spacey, cartoonish, synth laden, cheapy '80s soundtrack and instead put in a wide variety modern artists like Marilyn Manson, Destiny's Child, Little Bow Wow, Nine Inch Nails, Rob Zombie, Beck, Metallica, Cannibal Corpse, System of a Down, Paula Cole to name just a few. This is a teenage movie, so I suppose it made sense that they chose Queen instead of Brian Wilson or someone more adult oriented and ill-suited for a fantasy-swords and sorcery/sci-fi youth oriented film, but their annoying Dungeons and Dragons era music may have fit perfectly with the '80s teenage crowd but it needs an new facial guided by modern artists. Back in the day I guess, gifted, multidimensional, do-it-all bands like Queen were so diverse and talented (and unusually literate during their really old '70s cheez-o-rama glam rock period)that they could actually be counted on to score the entire film, like Prince who made all the music for his own films, and handle many types of styles and emotional states, but that's the best you can say about this. When I hear the final song in the movie ""A Kind of Magic"" I'm reminded of all these annoying '80s movies like Breakfast Club and Never Ending Story. Maybe Queen, because of their background, was perfectly suited to scoring a fantasy-mythology type story telling flick for young adults back then, but I think people like Marilyn Manson and Eminem are better suited to handle deep subject matter and rich, healthy, strong, youthful, passion and act as a guide for today's youth. Plus, I'd like to see some additions of alot of digitized creatures, giant lizards, furry teddy bares, squeeking mammals, cuddley aliens, cuter sound effects and various technical advancements and colorings and improvements that would give it an extra BANG and make kids want to see it again. Maybe some day they could switch the actors digitally and replace Christopher Lambert with Freddie Prinz Jr. and the female lead with Cameron Diaz's cheeky supermodel face. I mean, just use your imagination. But in the meantime, this flawed artifact, I suppose, was the genesis for a lot of superior sequals. If you want to see a great Highlander movie, rent the second one! This one needs work.",2.0
"Why? Why god why? Why did they have to ruin it?  I was walking through the store looking for Highlander on DVD. When I came across it, I wasn't sure at first due to its low price at 10 bucks. I just figured it wasn't that popular in that store, so I bought it.  As I unwrapped it, I couldn't wait to see the clear picture and the great sound of a classic movie on DVD! I then place the DVD in the player it turn it on. NOOOOO!! There are white specs flying across the screen! There are dust particles in the film! The pixles are visible! The music is blasting! The dialogue is almost muted! AAAAGGGGHHHHHH!! turning up the volume and turning down the volume constantly and then finding no special features to the movie. I love this movie, and it's a shame to watch it be carelessly converted into a CD that is actually worse than the VHS version! Please! Re-do this DVD!! Call it back!! Re-master it!",2.0
"The picture looks terrible, grainy, with specs flickering like it was a much older film. Sound in a Dolby Pro Logic system is terrible as well.(I understand this is not the case in a Dolby Digital system)I have other THX DVD's that look and sound fantastic, not this one!!!!
Don't let yourself be fooled by the THX endorsement it is not an absolute guarantee.",2.0
"The premise is, indeed, very cool -- but the execution just seems very off.  Clancy Brown has delivered much better performances than he does here, and it's hard to take him seriously as the main villain.  The character development in the flashback sequences is OK, but it makes no sense why anyone does what they do in the modern era, and some of the dialogue is just ear-gratingly bad.  Worst of all, though, the gathering itself just doesn't have the sense of drama you'd expect it to.  There doesn't seem to be much of a sense of urgency to any of the characters, and that makes the film itself seem kind of slow.
I was also disappointed by the film quality, as I think other reviewers have observed . . . haven't really looked at the other DVD extras, but I don't see them overcoming the general disappointment I had in the movie itself.",2.0
"This is a classic, underrated SCI-FI Fantasy film from the 1980's.  It's too bad the digital transfer is so bad.  The audio is uneven, and the picture is full of shimmering and other distortions.  I think mines going to get auctioned off.  Here's hoping the Studio releases a new version of this one!!!",2.0
"I saw the film in the cinema a long time ago and it impressed me much. I was 23 at the time. The good memories blossomed in my mind so I decided to buy the DVD because I thought it was such a classic.  Actually, with the  eyes of the 32-old that I am now, it's really bad. Except for Sean Connery  the acting is bad, for starters. The fighting scene music is atonal mayhem  (considering I appreciate heavy metal, that is saying something). Specific  to this DVD: The Director's Cut thing adds little, if anything. The sound  and music is very loud in comparison to the dialogues. Sometimes there is  subtitling when they're actually not saying anything audible.",2.0
"Two-star rating is for technical quality, not the merit of this classic Frank Capra holiday film.

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the first motion pictures to undergo computer colorization in the mid-1980s. Results of this process were then at best mediocre. No true reds (they often look brown), and an overabundance of pastels and broad-brush tinting made this one of the color-enhanced movies that stigmatized the process, perhaps for all time.

Although now a perennial holiday favorite, in first run ""Wonderful Life"" failed to earn back its $3.7 million cost.

Shortly after its release, the FBI cited this movie's anti-banker plotline as a common ploy used by Communists. There may be some truth here, for the story was partly scripted by Dalton Trumbo, playwright Clifford Odets and poet/critic Dorothy Parker. All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his ""fellow travelers.""

SYNOPSIS--
After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers). In a clever variation of Dickens' Christmas spirits visiting Scrooge, Clarence shows the despairing man how the townspeople of Bedford Falls would be far worse off if George Bailey never existed.

"I was shocked at the level of quality presented in this THX certified DVD. I have grown to rely on this certification, as most customers undoubtably have, to ensure that I'm getting the highest quality product. This goes for  equipment as well as (up to this point) DVD's.
The picture quality is  very poor and inconsistent throughout the film. The picture is very grainy  and washed out. The sound levels increase and decrease throughout the film  to the point where I became extremely distracted and began to pay  attenditon to the poor quality of film/sound more than to the film  itself.
I cannot get over the fact that this was THX certified. This  certainly puts a whole new light on the certification standards. I am so  dissapointed that I will be sending several e-mails out to other parties to  voice this opinion. Something that I never, ever do. However, I feel pretty  ripped off after viewing this film.
That said, there is one scene that  does shine. The last battle. Very nicely done and very clear and clean  visually.
Too bad. Otherwise the premise of this film is pretty  interesting. The screenplay varies from exceptional to cheesy. Again,  inconsistency. Someone else should have overseen production on this one.  Could have been a keeper.",2.0
"Absolutely horrible.  I must have misread the front label, but isn't this film supposed to be THX-certified?  It is beyond any doubt the worst looking film in my DVD collection at this moment.  I even have a Madacy DVD  which looks better than this!  Where to begin....the picture quality is  extremely blocky, I see compression artifacts left and right and up and  down.  The grain of the film is too prominent.  On and on...bottom line: I  think the VHS version of a non-director's cut of Highlander looks better  than this DVD.  And the sound!  Groan.  Sometimes I could barely hear the  dialogue which sounds thin and reedy, and in the next scene the sound  effects come blaring out the speakers.  The sound quality is very uneven;  it almost seems like the producers of this DVD took a monophonic soundtrack  and attempted to make it into 5.1.  Who knows?  As for the extras...HAH!  It is totally disorganized, almost as if someone took a stack of  papers/photos off the desk, scanned them randomly into a computer and  transfered them onto the DVD.  Furthermore, the photo gallery repeats a lot  of the photos (duh) and zips right by at 24 photos a second (duh).  By the  time you realize it, probably 200 pages have gone by before you can hit the  pause button.
So, is there anything to like about this DVD?  Well, it  does show the uncut widescreen version of Highlander as seen in Europe, so  Americans may see a few extra enlightening scenes.  There is a commentary  by the makers of the film, which is of some interest (and which I found to  be more listenable than the actual ""THX-certifed"" soundtrack).  And the price is quite affordable.  Fans of the film will probably want to  buy the DVD, even though it looks and sounds pretty bad (you've been  warned!).
But for the picky DVD collector, for goodness sakes, stay away  from this DVD!",2.0

"This GOODTIMES version of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946) is recorded in LP speed and doesn't contain a HiFi audio track.

Slower speed non-HiFi tapes have degraded picture quality, with sound clarity that's dependent on the alignment of your machine's playback head (a stationary device similar to the sort found in a cassette deck). The slightest variation in azimuth from the mfr's dubbing unit means blurry audio, often with a background squeal. Additionally, such slow-moving tracks have limited frequency range and an increased amount of flutter.

All HiFi videotapes come with a back-up linear track such as described above, but on HiFi VCRs the sound, which is laid down on a slant alongside the video portion, is picked up by the rotating video drum. This simulates a tape moving at an enormous rate of speed. The advantage is a frequency response, dynamic range and harmonic distortion level that nearly equals CDs in quality (if you connect your VCR's audio outs to a decent amplifier).

All pedantry aside, for anyone still seeking a videotape of this classic film, choose one from a major studio rather than a budget brand like GOODTIMES.",2.0
"Two-star rating is for technical quality, not the merit of this classic Frank Capra holiday film.

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the first motion pictures to undergo computer colorization in the mid-1980s. Results of this process were then at best mediocre. No true reds (they often look brown), and an overabundance of pastels and broad-brush tinting made this one of the color-enhanced movies that stigmatized the process, perhaps for all time.

If a VHS is desired, stick with a major studio version, as all budget labels dubbed their tapes at slower speeds.

"This is a great film - far superior to the unfortunate sequels that followed.
The packaging of the film is not too bad, supplementary material is pretty good, including the script and loads of pictures from  the film.
Russel Mulchay's audio commentry is informal and relaxed with  some usfull insights into the film.
However the transfer is abissmal, the  film quality is extremely grainy - and the disc has far too many digital  artifacts that appear even with the correct contrast and brightness  setup!
I haven't checked this out on DTS yet but the dolby digital  encoding is good - the battles sound real the music is bright (possibly a  little to bright for some but not bad).
It is hard to believe that this  DVD has the THX seal of approval - it certainly doesn't deserve it!
However for the small ammount of money it now costs it is worth it for  the supplimentary material.
However due to the inferior nature of this  particular disc hopefully someone will sort it out and produce a proper  version that does DVD justice!",2.0
"The movie is good, but the transfer is mediocre.  While it is superior to the VHS standard, it is only barely so, and does not live up to the quality we expect in a DVD.  This is one that needs a new transfer, with a  qualified team, and lots of extras to get us to pay another $10 for a new  disk.  Mine is about to be a coaster.",2.0
"The poorest image quality I'v yet seen on a DVD.  Sound was decent but the video transfer from film to DVD is truly poor. Viewed on a 53"" Sony RPTV.  Poor image would be much less noticeable on a 27"" or so tube  TV.",2.0
"I got into the whole Highlander scene watching the series on USA. I was so hooked i even watched the animated series, but this was absolutely awful. This was just a paycheck for Christopher Lambert, he didn't put any pizazze  into this character at all. I found myself wondering what had posessed me  to rent this in the first place. The sword fights were even bad, i mean its  just sword action, can't go wrong there i would think. I wouldn't watch  this again if it was the only thing on at 4am during and insomneia fit.",2.0
"If you really like the movie, can get a good deal on it, and won't be paranoid that your DVD player is on the fritz, then buy it.  The picture is worse than a typical new VHS tape, but the sound is 5.1 (though only fair  in quality).",2.0
"What an absolute atrocity.  The picture quality on this DVD is the worst I have *EVER* seen.  I'm fortunate to have the same edition on laserdisc, in addition to the original US release on laserdisc, and the quality in both  cases is far superior.  You'll think something is wrong with your DVD  player if you buy this version.  If you can't find the LD, go for  VHS.
Now, that having been said, the MOVIE is my all-time fave.  Love the  idea, love the cinematography, and love the performances of all the actors,  especially Connery.  It's true that the original US cut makes somewhat less  sense than the Director's Cut, but that's a two-edged sword.  The flow of  the original US cut was better, while the Director's cut drags a bit in  places.  Also, the US cut, while ""confusing"" is also mysterious  in a way that made it fun to watch again and again, because you had to  figure out little details that are simply explained in the Director's  cut.
Overall, it's a pity this DVD is such a hack job.  If it's ever  remastered (which it should be), then they should do the same thing they've  done with some other DVD titles -- allow you to select whether you want the  US release or the Director's Cut.  Also, think ANAMORPHIC!",2.0

"At the time I write this review, there are 555 reviews posted for the this Blu-ray version and 555 reviews for the 60th Anniversery DVD version. How is it possible for Amazon to have the same amount of reviews for a Blu-ray that is barely a month old and a DVD that is 3 years old. There is only one way, Amazon takes the DVD reviews and puts them under the Blu-ray product. I'm a huge fan of Amazon, but this practice borderlines false advertising. It's wrong, especially classic movies like this where the movie sells its self.

Amazon has to stop doing this practice. Please start listening to us customers, and please review the exact product we are researching for purchase. We especially want to know the quality of the Blu-ray against the DVD version. There are many Blu-ray versions out there that are not worth the purchase. In fact, the DVD played in a Blu-ray player actually looks and sounds better than the Blu-ray version. We will respect and trust Amazon reviews far more and you will have more loyal customers for it. I want to buy this product. Do I buy the Blu-ray or the 2006 DVD? After 555 reviews - I have no idea!!!",2.0
I got this one because I didn't know about the latest 2disc DVD release with B/W and color remastered versions. I was interested in this release because the colorized version was the only remastered version I knew of.  Lighting in all the other B/W releases is NOTHING like the originals due to several decades of VAULT DECAY.  Remastering is required to see anything close to what the directors/editors originally produced 50 years ago.,2.0
What a charming and heart-warming piece of movie history this is. It's nice to think what a positive difference we can make to other peoples lives without realising it!

"The character wished poorly.

Instead of wishing he'd never been born, how about wishing he'd got all the things he wanted?  Instead of being stuck in a second rate savings and loan with a partner too senile or stupid to hold onto $8000, he might have been a bank president in a big city.

Instead of tearing his guts out helping ingrates, he could have been helping himself to a glass of properly aged scotch, given to him by someone in the banking industry who appreciated his abilities.

And what about Potter?  If he'd gone to jail, I might have said the movie had a happy ending.

It is particularly disgusting when Stewart explores his own non-existence to find his wife to be a pathetic librarian that has no life to fill without being married.

"""It's a Wonderful Life"" was so very UN-wonderful to the American public when it opened that the only reason that most people have seen it is that it was allowed to go into ""public domain"" because the studio didn't want to waste the money it would cost to renew the copyright!
Beaten to death for years by being played on TV stations across America (who could air it for free), it was sometimes shown by three or more competing stations in the same market ... simultaneously.
Unable to escape this dreadful mush of shmaltz, millions of Americans were exposed to it.  With bits and pieces of it being shown in other films and TV shows (again, for free), there was no way to avoid having this ""meme"" drilled into one's consciousness.
Seen by itself at some other season than Xmas, shorn of all hoopla, this turns out to be a truly mediocre picture, which has cursed us even more by inspiring even worse remakes, adaptations, and parodies.
""A Christmas Carol"" (preferably the Alastair Sim version!!!) is the best Xmas viewing (preferably followed by one of the earlier versions of ""Miracle on 34th Street"").

"I was very disappointed for the single reason of the acting.  Many big names but they seemed to be ""phoning in"" their parts.  Many were over acted, others underacted.

As for the history involved in the series, I think it may whet the appetite and compel others to research this more deeply.",2.0
"If you're looking for something to watch on one of those stay inside kind of days, then this will probably fit the bill. Otherwise, its not a bright spot in the annals of war films. For starters, Dwight Yoakum was not only cast in the film, but cast as the battalion commander. Dwight Yoakum should never be cast in ANYTHING. The cast was unknown, for good reason. The screen writers, both for story line, and dialog, should hope to remain unknown, aswell. The uniforms of both sides were inaccurate. Particularly those of the wehrmacht. There was never any allied air cover seen, or heard. The gross insubordination, cowardice, and low morale depicted, was completely wrong, very disappointing to see, and a disservice to the real men that were there. The German artillery had no recoil, ofcourse, (although, the sturmgeschutzen cannon looked real enough), and had no infantry defense, (which would indicate that the GI's were several kilometers BEHIND the German lines.) And the 88mm rounds could be heard incoming. In reality, the 88mm round hits BEFORE the sound of the gun can even be registered. The make-up artist was keen on using dark eye liner, for some reason, which gave the affect of punk rockers, rather than dirty soldiers. The film left a lot of room for improvement, but I've definitely seen worse. The director made an admirable attempt for the budget he had. But, some historical issues could've been dealt with, with a small amount of effort and expense.",2.0
"Good storyline, terrible acting and direction",2.0
"Little more than a serviceable introduction to the historical proceedings. Wooden acting all round. In fact, Sheen looks like he's sleepwalking (or punchdrunk) through the thing. Still, Hauer does manage to conjure some sympathy as the Russian captain who does his best to save all his men, though, regardless of what he does, he can't win back home with the Soviet officials. Otherwise, there are handful of interesting insights into submarine culture--if what we're seeing is an accurate portrayal.
Overall, Hostile Waters the feel of a mediocre (to bad) TV movie (which I'm assuming it isn't), including some particularly unconvincing special effects--to the extent that, though this was made in 1997, I would've guessed '87. It just looks that dated. Only Hauer and Sheen's haggard appearances are any clue that it was made later.",2.0

The Battle of the Hurtgen Forest, and the sacrifices of the 28th Infantry Division, PA National Guard (""The Bloody Bucket"") deserve a great movie.  This isn't it.",2.0
"Just an OK movie.  I thought it would be better based on the reviews, and it was almost a good movie.  They obviously had a decent budget for the movie, and they had an OK story to work with, but unfortunately the movie had a terrible script, probably no military advisors, was loaded with every WWII stereotype, and had ho-hum actors (you couldn't get anyone better than Dwight Yoakam?).  Call me picky, but there were also these annoying little things that irked me as cheap, sloppy lack of details; some of the helmets of the main characters had obvious paint-overs from previous movies that the props department cut corners on (and don't tell me it was subtle realism to reflect the reuse of helmets from other units).  Also, Dwight Yoakam's map at about 30 minutes into the movie looked like a silly 8th grade art project.  Really?  The props department couldn't jump on eBay and get a vintage Army grid map for $30?  The movie came close, but just missed on a lot of points.  The ending was a little corny too, trying too hard to be ironic.",2.0

"I very much enjoyed the series when it first aired, but I was very disappointed with this DVD set. This set presents the episodes in widescreen, but since they were filmed in a full-screen aspect ratio the top and bottom of the image is cut off. This leads to awkward framing of many scenes, and some scenes where crucial parts just aren't visible. I would highly recommend skipping this set and trying to find a copy of the older 1998 release.

Other than the aspect ratio issues, the show itself is still great, and presents a view of the portions of the space race that often get overlooked. I had read and enjoyed Andrew Chaikin's book ""A Man on the Moon"", and this miniseries lived up to the book that inspired it. In addition to the types of space capsule drama featured in the movie ""Apollo 13"" there are episodes that focus on the engineers and scientists, the astronaut's wives, the politicians, and even the Georges Mlis' 1902 movie ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"". The miniseries was produced by Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, and Tom Hanks, the same people that made the movie ""Apollo 13"", so they avoid showing that mission at all by instead focusing on the news reporters that covered it.

The cast were great, and include such diverse actors as Tom Hanks, Jay Mohr, Clint Howard, Chris Isaac, Bryan Cranston, Cary Elwes, Dave Foley, Adam Baldwin, Steven Root, Kevin Pollak, Sally Field, Al Franken, John Carroll Lynch, Debra Jo Rupp, and Alan Ruck. Many of these actors are better known for their comedy rolls, but do an excellent job in this more serious work.",2.0

"The product details online say that the aspect ratio is 1.33:1 (4:3). The box and all the CDs say 16:9 widescreen and it is wide screen (16:9) when you play the CDs.

This means that this is not an original version as advertised. It also means that top of people heads are cut off and what takes place at the bottom of the screen is missing.

You get 5 CDs not 4 so what I am guessing they are advertising (selling you) one version and shipping a different version.",2.0

"I watched the TV series back in 1998 on HBO and I liked it. I found it to be quite entertaining. At the time I wasn't quite informed about the Apollo and Gemini space programs and the show provided me with good information about them.

Skip to 2010. I bought the excellent book ""A Man on the Moon"" by Andrew Chaikin with a foreword by Tom Hanks. In it, Hanks claims to have used the book as the main source for the TV series. This book is very informative and covers a lot of details of the trips to the moon.

I watched the TV show once again to see how detailed it was about the whole Apollo program. I now realize that it leaves many, many things aside and it includes made-for-TV fictional drama. Consider the Apollo 14 mission, possibly the most challenging trip to the Moon, one that encountered never-ending problems from start to end. In the TV show, this mission is summarized basically  as a trip so that Alan Shepard can play golf on the Moon. This is simply bastardizing an epic mission.

Another episode is all about the wives of the astronauts and their hard, sometimes petty, troubles. This episode is almost nothing but fictional drama. Was it really necessary? The answer is no.

I could go on and on about other material left aside in favor of Hollywood-type fiction but you get the idea.",2.0

"****The following review is NOT based on the movie itself, but rather the quality and features the disc offers.****
Though the picture was much more clear and crisp, it still lacked ANY special features, which is a big deal to me, hence the 2-star review. The disc menu literally has 2 options- Play Movie and Chapters. This is pathetic for a Blu-Ray movie, let alone a blockbuster hit movie full of awards and fantastic trivia and facts. I would expect this from a DVD but not a $17 Blu-Ray.
Also, they did not format the movie to fit flatscreen TV's. So don't expect this movie to take up your entire screen.
Lastly, a couple of suggestions of how to access your own special features of this film:
1. IMDB has a lot of interesting information and trivia about the movie that will leave you more fulfilled from the Blu-Ray.
2. There was a complete ""Making of"" Sands of Iwo Jima made in 1993 that I'm sure you can look up on YouTube.
Hope this helped. Semper FI!

P.S. Look, i'm not knocking the movie or John Wayne. I absolutely love both. I think it's weird that 3 people took the time to say that my review wasn't helpful. Like I stated at the beginning, it's not a review of the movie. If you want special features, you have to look harder.

"Why do war movies get everything wrong? This is supposed to be about the battle for the Kall Trail, part of the horrendous Battle of the Huertgen Forest in 1944. That was a very interesting, bloody conflict. However, in the movie, the terrain is all wrong (the Kall trail is a steep trail down into a deep ravine where it crosses a little stream before rising back up a steep trail--in the movie it looks like the Rio Grande), the tactics are from the trenches of WWI, not WWII (the soldiers all stand up together and slowly walk on line to get slaughtered), and the weapons are ridiculous (the German 88 and tanks are direct fire weapons, not artillery).
Not sure how making this movie with just a tiny bit of historical accuracy would have been so difficult. Is it because the writers/producers/directors are stupid, or because they are lazy, or because they actually do want to portray the past incorrectly?",2.0

"We purchased this movie thinking it would give insight to the famous Malmady Massacre that kicked off the Battle of the Bulge.  It did show an interesting perspective of three soldiers cut off from American lines during the the bloody battle of the Hurtigen Forest, but not one to long be remembered.",2.0
"While the setting supposedly takes place in the Hurtgen Foreset, it actually could have been set anywhere during WWII.  The movie doesn't do much to tell the true story of the battle, but rather focuses on Private Manning and his quest to get out of the war, no matter what or how.  I just didn't find the story all that believeable.  There may have been a few soldiers during WWII that went about their duties only to survive, no matter what happened around them.  But I think it was ONLY a few and I doubt any of them would ever have been promoted.  You need leaders to lead and he was not a leader.

I've read All the Way to Berlin by James Megallas, Flyboys by James Bradley, Ghost Soldiers by Hampton Sides and numerous Stephen Ambrose books to try to get an idea of what these men went through and how they felt.  Throughout these books you find stories of individual heroism and self sacrifice.  Maggie (James Magallas) led his troops and was promoted.  Dick Winters led his troops and was promoted.  It goes on about how they led and became leaders.  Countless stories of non-com's taking over during D-Day and other theaters when their commanders were killed or MIA.  Stepping up to led, not having to be told to lead.

I found the movie to be the exact opposite of what I learned about the men that fought in WWII.",2.0
"I disagree with others raving about this movie.....there is a reason it is not shown on HBO anymore and that is because the acting literally stinks. The director did a horrible job with a great storyline and the characters come across as non-believable. The flame thrower scene when they attack the gun emplacement was literally ridiculous.....I had to shut the sound off because of the idiotic forced screaming the guy was doing. Over all I found this movie very hard to get into, I felt like I was on the outside rather than immersed in the storyline and I LOVE war movies. Once again, great story but a lousy portrayal.",2.0
"WHEN TRUMPETS FADE starts off great, but then devolves into something little better than paperback fiction.

This is really the first film to take on the often forgotten Battle of the Huertgen forest.  In that, I applaud director John Irvin.  The storyline is a grim.  Private Manning discovers that he is the sole survivor of his squad.  As other noncomms and officers become casualties, Manning finds himself rapidly promoted -- against his will.  As a newly promoted sergeant, Manning is assigned a group of replacements and his own selfish survivalist attitude is sidelined in order for him to teach the new arrivals.

No doubt about it.  In this movie does a good job introducing the death factory of the Huertgen and recreating the partially overrun fortifications of the German Westwall.

Unfortunately, the film derails from historic reality with the renewed attacks on the Kall Gorge.  The entire Kall River Bridge fight is as phony as the bridge battle scenes in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.  After a promising start, it appears that no one on the production staff bothered to read up on what actually happened on the narrow Kall trail and the struggles on either side of the gorge.  The true story alone would have made for a good movie.

One of the best books written on the Huertgen Forest is FOLLOW ME AND DIE by Cecil B. Currey.  Having previously read that book and several others, as well has having had the good fortune to tour the actual Huertgen battlefield, I am bound to be more critical than most of this film. At a time before I had cable HBO a co-worker told me that this film was very good.  Unfortunately I had to wait a couple years before it was available on VHS (and now DVD).  As I watched the film for the first time I kept hoping the movie would redeem itself before the end credits.  Alas, it was not to be.

In the film, despite the fact that the US Army cannot come close to breaking though the German lines, Manning's green squad continuously does so and wreaks havoc with the Germans.

There are some good fight scenes, but please do not confuse this nighmarish fantasy with what really happened along the Westwall in late 1944.  Come on, now.  American officers would not blow whistles to signal an attack.  Why not just invite a German artillery barrage?

The movie was filmed in Hungary, no doubt to acquire military hardware and extras at a bargain.  This movie would have had potential had someone taken the opportunity to read a book on the subject.  As such, the battle in the Huertgen is just as distorted as the many Battle of the Bulge movies gone awry. I came away from this film thinking that it was Irvin's remake of HAMBURGER HILL by inserting 1944 Europe.

Buy this movie as military fiction.  Some fine moments.  Try to ignore the horrible soundtrack.",2.0
"O.K. the movie was pretty bad. It disgraces all of the soldiers that fought and died together in the Hurtgen Forest.

IT IS NOT A HAPPY THING SO DONT PLAY HAPPY MUSIC. ALMOST ALL OF THE SOLDIERS  IN THIS BATTLE NEVER EVEN MADE IT HOME FOR CHRISTMAS!! THEY DIED SO WE CAN BE FREE!

"Compared to the best I have seen, i.e. SPR and Band of Brothers, this dog barks. The acting is atrocious and the plot so contrived it begs ridicule. And the guy that plays the Major should stick to country music and leave the acting to people a bit less wooden.

Save your money, buy Band of Brothers or The Lost Battalion.",2.0
"This film has an all-too-common flaw in war movies: it tries to make infantry combat exciting and spectacular, full of daring behind-the-lines raids and exploding fireballs.  Nowhere do you find scenes of soldiers sitting for hours on end in cold, wet foxholes under shell and mortar fire, feeling helpless before an enemy they cannot see and cannot strike back at. The battle of the Hurtgen Forest was a dreadful attritional struggle that pushed the soldiers who fought there to their utmost limits of physical and mental endurance.  Any film seeking to do their story justice would have to break way from the cliches of war movie melodrama.  Sadly, ""When Trumpets Fade"" fails to do so, despite some good performances and a few well-directed sequences. And much of it lacks military credibility: the American infantry advances bunched up in long lines instead of being spread out in small groups, and no one ever thinks to send an artillery observer forward so key German positions can be brought under aimed shellfire.",2.0
"This could have been a really good movie.
There were a couple scenes that were good, like when Eldard takes his new squad into their foxholes. It was really ominous and suspenseful. But the thing I really didn't like  about it were the blatant technical inaccuracies.
When the company made  their push through the minefield, it was infuriating to see them so bunched  up. Groups of 3 here, 5 there, and 7 over there. Each man should have had  at least 20 to 25 meters between him and his buddy. AT LEAST!
I've spent  the better part of my life studying weapons and tactics and how they are  employed in the field, so when I see a BAR firing about 100 rounds without  the man behind it changing magazines, it pisses me off. Or when every time  an enemy soldier gets hit, he lurches around for a couple seconds and then  finally screams or says, ""Ahh!"".
When a burning hot hunk of  lead smashes into you, you fall to the ground like a ton of bricks. It's  like you don't have legs anymore. That's it; you're down. End of story.  Call for a corpsman if you can, but more than likely, it'll be somebody  else yelling, ""Corpsman up!"". I know that in the army, the  majority call for a Medic, but I'm speaking for a different branch. That's  what geting shot is like.
And the fat guy wasting nearly all of his fuel  in the flamethrower, just screaming, screaming, screaming. It's  ludicrous.
Also, why in the hell do movie makers feel they have to create  huge fireballs to make an artillery blast look real?
Artillery doesn't do  that. The movie kept on showing 88mm shells hitting the trees, which, yes  it did happen, but then for some reason, billowing fireballs would eminate  from the ground. Artillery sends a lot of dirt and dust in the air along  with a hell of a lot of fast-flying shrapnel. There almost no flame at all.  It just annoys me, that's all.
I would recommend against adding this  movie to your collection. I got it a month ago, and it was so depressing I  haven't watched it since then.
A Midnight Clear, Saving Private Ryan, or  Stalingrad are the ones people should see.",2.0
"Although the subject matter is interesting (Hurtgen Forest 44'), the film is weak.  Ron Eldard does a good job in the lead role, but all of the other primary actors are poor.  This is especially true Dwight Yokum who plays a  sterotypical callous and ruthless battalion CO. Of course there is the  angst ridden company CO and the cowardly platoon commander.  The treatment  of the Germans in the film is deplorable and in fact there are only handful  of shots featuring German infantry.  As far as simulating the actual  battle, this film is a stinker.  The Americans bunch up in attack like on a  Sunday stroll and the Germans are able to foil an entire battalion attack  with a single 88mm gun with no infantry support!  If you want a good  ""realistic"" war movie, buy Saving Private Ryan, Stalingrad,  Tora! Tora!Tora!, The Iron Cross, or the Battle of Britain.",2.0

"I guess it's still true (to some degree anyway) that being a MOVIE STAR has more, uh, cachet to it than being a TV actor.  But sometimes you have to wonder why.  Watching this mediocre-at-best 1994 effort featuring former TV star Woody Harrelson, future TV leads Kiefer Sutherland and Dylan McDermott, you just might wonder why that's the case.  These actors can all be justifiably proud of their work on (respectively) CHEERS, 24, and THE PRACTICE.  I can't imagine that they bring up this film much in conversation as being one of the highlights of their careers.

Which is not to say that they don't all give it their best shot.  As our cowboys-loosed-in-the-Big-Apple heroes, Sutherland and Harrelson are affable enough.  And it's interesting to see McDermott take on a menacing villain's role.  But otherwise, this movie is pretty predictable ""fish out of water"" fare.  And speaking of TV shows, didn't Dennis Weaver pretty much mine all the possibilities of out of that particular plotline decades ago on McCLOUD?

Of course, McCloud never resorted to such grotesqueries as we witness in the ""hungry calf"" scene.  Even in the new millennium, television seldom stoops quite THAT low. The filmmakers must have been getting a little desperate at that point.  I believe this is what's known as ""jumping the shark.""  Or some variation on that phrase involving a ""calf.""  One shudders to think.",2.0
Snoooz- very boring courtroom drama.  Watching the A list of actors was the only intersting part of the movie.  I watched half of the movie before turning off.

"Don't worry.  My dislike of the film is not because I'm a myopic Ayn Rand reading half wit who's touched in the head.  Nor am I intentionally trying to offend anyone by showing callousness to the subject matter.  The reason I didn't like this movie is because its tone was schizophrenic.

The worst thing about this movie is the music.  For the purpose of this review, I tried to imagine I had seen a special director's cut where the orchestra was edited out entirely.  But I just can't.  The music was so overpowering and obnoxious, that I thought at first I forgot to close an internet page and some commercial was autoplaying.  Whenever President Adams was on screen, that suffocating music was playing and I couldn't focus on the dialog.  The things he said reminded me of every other sleazy politician, but I guess from the music he was actually a sagacious humanist who walked on water as he sings to the bluebirds like Snow White.  It may seem like a minor thing, but it was more off putting than the laugh track on The Big Bang Theory!

The scenes on the ship were disturbing.  I didn't see the point in being so explicit.  It really makes me wonder about the kind of person who intentionally seeks movies like this out.  I'd expect that stuff from indie films because the sole purpose of many of those movies is to make you feel horrible.  So to go from this sappy music with John Adams tending flowers to a twenty minute scene of a slaughterhouse more depraved than American Horror Story... I think Spielberg needed to choose which type of movie he wanted.  Perhaps other people appreciated the juxtaposition of 'civilized' debate to unimaginable barbarity, but for me it just didn't work.  I liked how MacCouneghey's character tried to work within the legal system to do what was humane (he treated the slaves as property from a legal perspective).  And I liked the different perspectives.  I especially liked how the individual slaves had actual personalities and how they conceptualized the people in the courtroom.  But I had enough when the main slave stood up and said 'give us free, give us free, give us free' accompanied by an orchestra AND a choir.  I was surprised to learn Amistad didn't win the academy award for best picture, nor was it nominated.  As I looked at the films that did win or were at least nominated, it occurred to me that I didn't even like at least half the movies on the list.  It almost seems to me that the less subtle the emotional cues and the more heavy handed the message, the more popular the movie.  Honestly, this film seemed more like Zemeckis than the director of Schindler's list.  I'm sure I'll be having nightmares from that scene on the ship for some time.",2.0

"I found the movie to be sterile, hollow and bereft of character development, especially concerning the black rebels. If Spielberg can't be counted on to view the blacks as more than just so much cargo---much like the slave traders, navy captors, Queen Isabella of Spain, the courts, etc---then why should the audience view them as otherwise?  In fact, I found myself viewing the legal argument---of who has superior property rights to the blacks---as more compelling than the drama of whether they would achieve freedom; I was actually rooting for the slave traders to get possession and make good on their investment.",2.0
"Another Spilbergian piece of Hollywood propaganda about how slavery was bad and it was all the fault of Europeans. Funny that Spielberg chooses to omit the African character's lucrative enterprise in the slave trade when he returns to his homeland. Maybe he should make more movies about the countless Africans who enslaved other Africans to explain how they eventually came to America: after all as Caine said, ""Am I not my brother's keeper?""

 The movie is filled with false historical characters and gives the impression that the civil rights movement well underway as early as in the 1840s: baloney! Even in the 1860s, abolitionism was nothing but propaganda to lure ignorant zealots as canon fodder to the front lines of the Civil War; the cause of the conflict being a lot more disturbing: carpetbagging industrialists looking for low paying factory slaves to the north and snug plantation dixiecrats wanting to keep their slaves south of the Mason-Dixie line. Perhaps Spielberg should make a movie explaining how the KKK was formed in Connecticut and not the South as most people think.

 The film is too revisionist and soft-hearted for my taste. If a point is to be made by such films, then it should give weight to all of the issues involved. Maybe someone will have the guts to do a movie about these truths but,until then, I'll have to continue turning my head in disgust at this Hollywood drivel.",2.0
"This movie could be really good if it focused on the Middle Passage. The brief segement on the slave ship was by far the best sequence in the film. But the rest of the movie is dull, sappy, and overblown.
Also, its not very historically accurate. This is not a problem dramatically (""Nixon"" for example:great drama, horrible history), but its a personal pet peeve of mine. Also, as a history teacher, I find it disturbing that teachers were encouraged to use the film for educational purposes when it was released.",2.0
"I look with suspicion at anything that Spielberg lays his hand upon. THis was no exception. SPielberg is the total master of manipulation, disguising himself as a "" Great director"" .

"Superbly crafted, wonderfully acted, powerful, real, heartfelt, and impeccable. These are all adjectives that correctly describe this film. Here's a movie that had so much going for it. I really wanted to like this film. I sat down and was amazed with pleasure by some scenes and with other scenes sat in disgust and boredom. ""Amistad"" starts out with a battle scene that reminds me of another Spielberg movie, ""Saving Private Ryan"". The opening scene is done in a way that carries all the intensity that could make it seem real. The camera sways back and forth, in a way fighthing to get the actor in frame. It's as if the camera is an extra actor in the movie. It's scenes like this, that make me have some aprreciation for this film. The screenplay by David Franzoni is done with a lot of care and does try to offer a accurate description, but it remains uneven. Some scenes aren't as well polished as other scenes. This is all due to the directing by Steven Spielberg. On the surface he may seem to be the right man for this film, after making ""Schindler's List"", which this movie may remind some of, in it's style rather than content. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey, Djimon Housou, Nigel Hawthorne, and Anna Paquin are wonderful to watch. But that's not the problem with this movie. The problem lies in the screenplay. The viewer switches their moods toward the film too often. One moment a scene grabs all your attention and the next one leaves you asking for more. You actually get bored with the movie. And then a great scene will appear now and then again. But after a while, you just can't take it anymore. And your left to say that you don't enjoy this movie. The problem remains it's just way too uneven! ** 1\2 out of *****",2.0
"There is no honest representation of the African personality and cultural  background in the film. I did not have a clear concept of what was the  African cognitive/riligious/metaphysical concept of the tragedy of slavery.  They are defined mostly in an American Christian perspective. In one view  on La Amistad, you can barely distinguish the Africans performing Islamic  prayers in the background. None of the characters evoke any Islamic  statements of faith throughout the tragedy of enslavement and loss in the  sea. In another scene, the imprisoned Africans are dancing ""noble  savage"" style around a bonefire INSIDE the prison. How could that be  possible is beyond my imagination! The director is trying to fall back on  the old western movie depictions of the native indians running around the  camp fire performing the battle dance. The real theme of the story is not  the suffering of the Aficans enslaved and inside filthy ships in the  Atlantic; it is about the American society's treatment of the issue of  slavery and the true nature of the American system of government. Needless  to say that the director wants to tell the audience a political message:  that the core of the American political system is ethical and  ""GOOD"" hearted. The only characters shown in the movie to  actually benfit financially from the slave trade were the Spanish, the  Africans who cought Cinque,and the Cubans. Not a single scene brings to the  viewer's attention images of the suffering of the slaves in an American  plantation. This is an oversimplification of a complex issue, and a  superficial evaluation of important questions within a commerical context.",2.0

"Slavery is bad. That is the simple message of Spielberg's Amistad, which in its simplicity rises to the complexity of a 2nd grade history book. What a ""Genius"" like Spielberg clearly fails to understand is, if your  going to try to educate an audience, you have to involve them first.  Perhaps a real story, on a more intimate scale, with real human beings not  ""symbolic figures"" would have been far more engrossing. Alas,  Spielberg is way to important for that now, he has to ""BIG"" films  dealing with ""BIG"" issues and in the process he misses the mark  completely, becuase we are watching a lavishly produced, beautifully shot  2nd grade history lesson. Like the slightly better Saving Private Ryan,  Spielberg is to busy making grandiose statements to care about real  characters. Again John Williams cheesy(for a lack of a more accurate word)  is intrusive and full of self importance. I am really glad Mr. Spielberg is  going to do a Sci-Fi film next where he'll get to do some real film-making  and not hide behind big issues. Note: For a much better look at the  African-American fight for freedom, check out Ed Zwick's great Glory. Now  there's a film.",2.0
"This isn't a good movie. As Spanish I  don't complaint of the cruelty of other Spanish of past centuries. No doubt they were as bad as the movie  presents and much more, but also they were usually much better sailors and  fighters than currently is show, and masters to mock hypocrital British  blockade. For the really interested I strongly recommend two master  adventure novels by Pio Baroja a superb author well liked by Hemingway that  almost won the Nobel prize. These are titled ""Adventures of Captain  Chimista"" and ""Pilots of high Seas"" both written about 1900,  and you really will know that truly Spanish fearless trafficant of slaves -  between other many  illegal and inmoral bussines- used to do withouth  censorship.

"Good movie but the picture will not fill up the new flat screen tv's in 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. Maybe because it's release date was 1998 and before the larger flat screen TV's.

"This film was meticulously crafted to the established disaster movie recipe. That recipe demands a handsome but misunderstood hero, a pretty girl for him to rescue, a good but not particularly likeable person who  will die on cue and of course, a spectacular disaster.
That is exactly  what is served up here. The scenario is that the Holland Tunnel has  collapsed at both ends because of a multiple vehicle pile up that involved  some highly flammable waste being carried illegally through the tunnel. The  requisite set of characters are trapped inside the tunnel and have to find  a way out. Time pressure is added by the fact that the tunnel is not going  to keep the water out forever and Stallone has to find a way out through  long forgotten passages in order to save himself and the girl.
If you are  a disaster movie fan, you are sure to like this film because it passes all  of the standard disaster movie tests. However, there is nothing in the film  that can give it a wider appeal than that. The special effects for the  explosion in the tunnel are very good indeed but the impact of those  effects fades with time as new films go further with better  technology.
The things which make a film last are missing here. You can  be pretty sure about who will escape and who will perish so there is no  suspense. Also, despite a setting with a lot of potential, there is no real  atmosphere. A lot of that is down to the script and acting both of which  are pretty pedestrian.
As a result, I can only recommend this movie to  disaster film buffs and Stallone fans.",2.0

"There is a patince to the proceedongs of The Day of The Jackal that is wonderfful to watch. The film, like it should, starts slowly and build on layers of plot to an exciting trans-continental chase. Today most thrillers  would go for a cheap quick thrill like getting a character shot in the face  or having a limb blown off, but Zimmerman wisely avoids this preffering to  build on Phycological suspense. Alas, despite these qualites, the film has  dated terribly. All the charcters, regardless of nationality speak the same  language, and while I don't particularly care for realism in movies, I felt  it to be essential here. The acting is universally stiff and one sided. It  is understandable that Edward Fox should be constantly smiling, a sign of  villany in all modern films, but unlike say, the opening scenes of The  Crying Game there is no human intensity to the proceedings. Its all  calculated and cold. I understand why this film recieved raves on release,  but sadly it just doesn't measure up today. Having said that, I would  rather watch this film ten times in a row, with eyelids taped open  Clockwork Orange style than see ten minutes of the truly miserable Micheal  Caton Jones remake The Jackal.",2.0
"Young Ed Harris has a coon to make some time with Patsy Cline. Only because that is the singer's name; however, it's Jessica Lange providing a normal teenage? girl with a hankering to be a star and have some funtimes she can geegaw about to her mom.

"My 2.5 year old gets hyperactive when he gets tired so I bought some videos which I hoped would be soothing and calming. This one fails. First there are interviews with real kids, then a story, then another section of kids talking, and so on throughout the DVD. Don't get me wrong, the kids are sweet as can be, but the topics are not what a child needs to listen to when you are trying to get them to sleep. Much of the kids discussions are about bad dreams and nightmares, deceased family members in your head and dreams, and a bunch of other stuff that the target age for this video are too young to deal with, particularly at bedtime. These topics are more suited to actual parent-child discussion based on individual circumstances. And why would I want discussions of nightmares right before getting a child ready to sleep? The last little story is quite soothing and you can imagine your little one's eyes closing. But then, more kids talking about real life issues in everyday voices. The intrusion of real kids between bedtime stories is just plain jarring. If your child begins to fall asleep, they will surely wake right up again each time these kids come on. The actual stories are decent but not great, therefore the detractions of these kid interviews are just plain irritating, and I will not be showing it to my little guy. I wish I had listened to the reviewers who talked about the distraction/inappropriateness of children discussing nightmares and monsters in a video of bedtime stories.

"Half-baked always seemed to me to be a movie about weed, by people who know nothing about weed.  I know it is a movie and it is fictional but hallucinating that you are flying from smoking marijuana, expecially from swaggy government weed is so far from reality it is not even funny.  I hate it when movies and TV shows depict the effects of marijuana as if it is a PCP trip or something.  It is just a pet peeve of mine because it sets the law reform movement way back because idiots who believe what they see on TV, think marijuana makes people see elves and unicorns.

I have to admit the films does have some clever stoner puns and is very quoteable, ""wesley pipes"", ""billy bong thorton"" and Bob Saget's cameo line.  Yet it does not make up for the rest of the movie being so cartoonishly fake.  That is just my two cents.",2.0
"HALF-BAKED is a film trying to mimic something along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-in-Smoke/dp/B00004YNIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up in Smoke</a>&nbsp;in terms of incredulity and sophomorism, but fails to elicit the needed chuckle-factor it so ardently strives for. We even get a semi-cameo performance from Tommy Chong as a prison inmate known as ""The Squirrel Master"" but even his over-the-top antics couldn't save the film.

I'm not a big Dave Chappelle fan so that's probably a factor in my choice to review this film negatively. I don't watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chappelle-Show/dp/B00018YCIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chappelle Show</a>; I just can't stomach his lowbrow comedy. I am, however, a lover of Cheech and Chong's films of the late 70s and early 80s. They were the very personification of the drug culture spilling over from the 60s.

The best ""pot"" movie of late that I can recall was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski/dp/B000A7DVR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski</a>&nbsp;starring Jeff Bridges. More character piece than drug-culture talk, it had a very flawed and funny ""Dude"" at its core. Here with Half-Baked, the focus is muddled with side-jokes that often miss their marks.

The story is that of four marijuana smokin' friends who live lives of idleness and degeneracy. One buzzed-out day they send Kenny (Harland Williams) out on a munchies run. But while out collecting groceries galore, Kenny accidentally feeds all of the food to a diabetic police horse standing outside the store. The horse (of course) keels over of hyperglycemia and promptly dies. Kenny is whisked off to prison and a very serious threat to his anal virginity looms large. Protected by ""The Squirrel Master"" for now, Kenny must get bailed out before his protector hits parole. His three free buddies Thurgood (Chappelle), Scarface (Guillermo Diaz) and Brian (Jim Breuer) must come up with a flood of funds to spring him. Instead of ingenuity, though, they devise a not-so-sophisticated plan of selling lots and lots of weed. The trouble is, though, that another local drug lord wants in on their scheme. Also, Thurgood has fallen for a beautiful woman who's father is in prison for selling dope, and Thurgood must decide between love and getting high.

Homage to pot movies aside, the film simply isn't funny. There are a few lines that smack of excessive attempts to make the characters laughable (""I don't do drugs. I smoke pot."") and even they just don't hit the ol' funny bone.

The biggest blessing is that the film is only 82 minutes, so you don't have to put up long with it regardless.",2.0
"A few months back I ventured out to the local video store after a hard day at school.  ""Hmm,"" I thought.  ""Half-Baked...this looks good.""  After all, I doubt that Jim Brewer would be involved unless it was a class operation.  ""I'll take it.""
A more unwise choice I could not have made my friends.  Aside from a few, if you can believe it, pot jokes, the movie simply falls flat on its face.  There was one particulary entertaining part where Harlan Williams unknowingly feeds a diabetic horse enough junk food to kill, well, a horse, but beyond that it was just an incessant torrent of cheap jokes aimed at your average pot-smoking high school sophomore.  As a side note directed toward the aforementioned high-schooler: I recommend taking the advice of John Stewart's character (the ""ever done this...on weed?"" guy) because otherwise you will undoubtedly realize what an incredibly ill-begotten film this really was.
I will give Tommy Chong credit for his cameo, however.  It's good to see that Mr. Chong has managed to shed his image as a low-life pothead and resurrect his once flailing career.  He's come a long way really.  Take for example his role in Tin Cup.  When he told Kevin Costner that this was their last ball on the 18th faiway of the US Open, I was truly moved.  Inspired even.  Mr. Chong, I salute you and your craft sir.
As for Half-Baked, please avoid this one.  But if you must watch it, and I recommend against it, please take one message away from it.  Pot kills brain cells kids.  It's not hair, they don't grow back.  And if you're bald, ignore the first part.",2.0
"Half-Baked, a film about a couple of buddies who sit around all day and do drugs, is not only not worth while to watch, but it's filled with bad acting and a poor script with characters that don't seem to fit. When I watched it, I couldn't believe all the stupidty it produced. In every movie, I can find good for almost every scene, a way of understanding it and realizing what the director was trying to show his audience, but in this film, it was difficult to do that. I was very displeased in this, for it not only wasted my time, it made me think twice about renting another movie like this again. I would recommend American pie if your looking for a comedy. But for a film that does nothing but show drug usage, and shows no point in doing so, I'd recommend a more worth your while film, like Traffic or Scarface (Al Pacino).",2.0

""Scout"" has more behavior problems. Atticus explains his legal work. A man patches a hole in a tree. Jem found things in that hole. At night some cars arrive at the jail. Atticus bars the door, he defends it with moral strength. His daughter's presence turns the men back. [Believable?] The courtroom is packed solid, but there is room on the second floor. The trial begins with testimony from Sheriff Tait. Mr. Ewell tells what he saw. Lawyer Finch shows Ewell is left-handed. May Ellen testifies about what happened. Finch questions her.

Defendant Robinson tells how his left arm was lamed due to an accident on the job when he was twelve years old. [No child labor laws?] May Ellen repeats her claim. [You can judge her credibility.] Mr Robinson takes the stand and tells what happened. Will he be believed? He felt sorry for her? Lawyer Finch said there was no physical evidence for the crime.

The jury takes two hours to decide on guilty. Later Finch learns that Robinson was shot while trying to escape.

Jem and Tina May walk home in the dark for a final dramatic scene. They are attacked by a strange man. Jem is hurt. Mr. Ewell is found dead. Who rescued Jem? [Is the ending believable?] Sheriff Tait decides that Ewell fell on his knife. This case is closed. An example of poetic justice?

"I've always had a love affair with Ella Raines since first seeing her in Hail the Conquering Hero, and this movie may have been her best vehicle for showing off both her talent and beauty. But despite having many successful aspects of the film noir style, the movie never caught on and was pretty much panned by critics. The principle problem was that the script had a plot hole in it you could have driven an ocean liner through! The hero's problem was that he had to provide an alibi to prove that he didn't kill his wife after earlier having a quarrel with her. He goes to a bar, meets a woman who agrees to accompany him to a musical show without revealing her name, then disappears. When he persuades the police to accompany him while retracing his steps of that night, a bartender, a taxi driver, and a drummer and a singer at the show all state that they indeed saw him but not the woman. Because of this he is brought to trial, convicted and sentenced to death. The hole in the plot here is both simple and obvious. The various witnesses all prove that he was elsewhere when his wife was killed, whether he was with a woman or not! He hardly needs any 'phantom lady' to prove this, and no self-respecting policeman or DA would would have charged him given his solid alibi, let alone taken him to trial. This unfortunately serves to invalidate the entire rest of the movie.

The shame is that it didn't have to be that way, and one wonders if the original story from which the movie script was taken had avoided the absurdity of the plot's logic. It turned out that the real killer had bribed the various witnesses to say that the hero was not accompanied by a woman, when all that had to happen was for him to bribe them to say that they had never seen the husband instead and thus could not corroborate his alibi. The movie could then have proceeded from there as it did, since that way the phantom lady indeed became crucial to the hero's alibi. Yet for some reason this obvious solution was ignored, with the total loss of logic betraying the entire concept of the movie. Coupled with other lapses - Raines pursues the bartender, the drummer and the singer, and even the phantom lady, but never confronts the readily identified taxi driver; the killer after murdering the wife is somehow able to find the husband miles away from the scene of the crime and then after following him successfully bribes all 4 witnesses to remain silent even in the face of a police investigation of a murder - the script's illogic simply let Ella and her subsequent wildly entertaining performance as amateur sleuth down. One star for the absurdity of this major plot hole, but a second added for the lovely Ella!",2.0

"I really wanted to like Black Dog I really did. Unfortunately it hovers between watchable and turn it off for most of the film. The few action sequences in the film are clever ideas however they do not leave the viewer with the same excitement as many action clips. I felt bad for the actors, almost all of which are very good, because the script is very bland even for an action. The characters are very 2 dimensional and are not very original. You have The Loner, The Feuding Cops, The Lovable Oaf, The Stupid Kid, Token Black Guy that will inevitably die, The Religious fanatic, The hostage mother and daughter, and the just plain rotten guy. Many plot details will seem very familiar as well. The fact is with so many road movies out there there is a high bar in which directors must compete with. Had a better Screenwriter at the helm and focused more on the characters with more and better action sequences this could have been a fantastic film but what we get is a very lackluster movie that you actually feel pity for. Pretty much a let down but if you must watch it give it a rental but don't spend your money as there is nothing here worth seeing again.",2.0
"I watch (and love) zombie movies, so my ability to suspend disbelief or to enjoy mindless mayhem is extremely high. I don't even mind Mr Swayze in the right film. Red Dawn or Point Break? Watch them anytime. Road House or Next of Kin? Well, maybe not all the way through, but I can always make it to the next commercial break if I'm channel surfing and I see one of them. But this is so absurd, with such endless data dumps where Mr Swayze has to explain to the other characters his own back story or the inner workings of truck brakes (yawn on both counts), and with villains who are beyond comic relief to being just Darwin award winners, that it's impossible to sit through.",2.0
"Patrick Swayze is Jack Crews, a good man and ace trucker who lost his license and did some time over a manslaughter beef; now he just tries to make ends meet and keep a roof over the heads of his wife and daughter.  He agrees to run some guns to make the mortgage payment and from that point on he's in trouble up to his neck.  Obviously, this is a stupid movie, but that needn't preclude it from being fun.  Unfortunately, it's just boring for anyone who isn't a member of the monster-truck crowd.  For high-octane highway mayhem, rent ""The Road Warrior"" instead.",2.0
"Any movie with Meatloaf, Randy Travis and Patrick Swayze in it is definately worth watching, at least for the laughs.  In that respect, BLACK DOG certainly doesn't disappoint.  The acting in this movie is terrible, especially Swayze's neverending wooden facial expressions.  The plot is equally bad, and is never very engaging.  However, the one thing that saves this B-movie from being so bad it's unwatchable are the scences with Meatloaf quoting Bible verses while trying to kill Patrick Swayze and the hilarious bits about the black dog.  So, don't expect a quality piece of cinema, but if you're bored and need a laugh, it's worthwhile.",2.0

"I decided to watch this movie because a remake is coming out and I thought I'd like to see the original first. Glad I did. Well, no, actually, I wish I had never seen this movie, and I am glad only in that it has protected me from seeing the new version, which likely is more graphic and creepy. Clint Eastwood's version is well done for the time, which is to say very dated with its Civil War characters dressed and coiffed quite stylishly for 1971 viewers. Even Clint's hair is never out of place. The main characters are morally gray and emotionally unstable, and so you watch the action with distaste, not rooting for any one character among a cast of depraved manipulators. The story is less historical fiction than gothic horror.",2.0

"I think this is a terrible movie.  It creeped me out they way they all sneak around spying on each other.  The only reason I watch it is because the movie was made at the Ashland Belle Helene plantation house.  This house is on the Mississippi River about half way between New Orleans and Baton Rough.  I was lucky enough to have a tour a long time ago with the caretaker.  He took us all over the house including up on the roof.  Now the house and property are owned by Shell Oil and not currently open to the public.  I stop by everytime I am in the area just to gaze at it from the fence.  It's in a beautiful setting with huge old oak trees.  When watching the movie, I totally ignore the acting and look past them at the views of inside and outside the house. Who Dat!!",2.0
"I am giving this movie one star for succeeding in sucking me into the story.  I am giving it a second star for the opportunity to watch a young and tender Clint Eastwood.

Beyond that....this is one of those movies that ends so badly that I end up feeling resentful for having gotten engrossed in it.

This film portrays that a group of women will descend to any and every level, all in the hope of landing a man, and not even a spectacular one at that.  I don't think so.  This sells women SO short that I don't even know how to adequetely articulate it.  Let's just say that The Beguiled is one huge discredit to females everywhere.

"The TV/movie spoof genre met its inglorious end with this mess of generally unfunny skits that are excrutiating long.
The skits wrap around a spoof of a 1950's style science fiction movie (the title, with Steve Forrest in the starring role).  Perhaps this movie might have worked better had it just been a sci-fi spoof but it is bogged down by weak and unfunny bits.  For example, there is the naked girl in church (ha ha) and the Steve Guttenberg/Rosanna Arquette sketch about a device that checks out men before a women dates them.  There is also a sketch with Michelle Pfeiffer and Peter Horton as new parents, and Griffin Dunne as a doctor who has lost their baby.  There is also a dreadfully unfunny sketch at then end of the movie with Carrie Fisher as a patient with social disease.
Other semi-celebrities make an appearance.  David Allen Greer is Don ""No Soul"" Simmons, with B.B. King later appearing to plead for donations for a ""Blacks Without Soul"" charity.  Aresnio Halls appears as a man coming home to a series of mishaps (generally stolen from a similar routine in Naked Gun).  And there is Lou Jacobi as a man in his underwear being zapped all over TV with his remote control.
Since this genre was done better in Tunnelvision and Kentucky Fried Movie, it is suggested that you seek those out instead of this very tired debacle.",2.0

"I first watched this film when it came out and disliked it.  After seeing clips again in my art classes that reminded me of how beautiful the animation was, I decided to give it another shot but came to the exact same conclusion that I had years ago- the film on the whole... doesn't really add up to an enjoyable experience in the end.

To start off with the positive aspect- the animation work itself, the movement and the character designs and the staging and the general artistry are stunning- whoever as in charge absolutely knew what they were doing and I applaud them.

On the other end the vocal section of the music varies from alright to insipid (""Playing With the Big Boys Now"" is one of the more terrible songs I've heard in an animated film), and while I knew to expect it knowing the story the continued demonization of one of my favorite ancient cultures in almost every single movie that addresses them is always disheartening.  Obviously there is more to a film than these things, but I can not give an honest analysis on more nuanced issues such as background orchestral music or the nuances of vocal performances however because of my largest problem with the film- it's unbelievably depressing.  ""Grave of the Fireflies"" depressing, without even the little pieces of cheeriness that film allowed itself.

""Prince of Egypt"" is depressing to the point where it becomes difficult to focus on anything else, and both my brother and I were left speechless at how what is meant to be a great story of triumph for a culture could drag itself into such a colossal downer.  I would certainly not expect them to turn something that many people take so seriously as a completely happy story, but there has to be -some- kind of balance one can strike between that and everything ending in utter depressing tragedy.

If you're a fan of the art of animation for its own sake or someone looking for a beautifully rendered cultural/religious touchstone and can handle a certain amount of violence in an animated film, I would recommend this for you.  I know there are many people who enjoy it and  I'm glad of that because a great deal of good work was put into the production.  But for myself, my brother who re-watched it with me, and several others I have spoken to, the way the story falls off into everyone miserable or dead is just too much to be able to glean further enjoyment out of it.",2.0

"I wondered why this movie didn't get as much hype as most other Disney productions, then I realized- it's not Disney!!

The graphics were not nearly as spectacular as they're said to be and the story felt almost ""choppy"". The characters lacked emotion in all the wrong places. I would think that if I saw my first born killed, I'd be a bit more upset than Rameses was. Or if water became blood right before my eyes, my jaw would drop at least a little.

But my biggest problem with the movie was the soundtrack. Each song was very poorly written. No catchy choruses, no really lively numbers, nothing. One of the best parts of seeing a good animated film is that colors, gravity and the laws of physics are not an obstacle. The artists can create whatever song and put it to whatever setting. The imagination of the songwriters and illustrators definitely fell short.

One song in particular, ""You're playing with the big boys now"" was the most dissapointing. The lyrics merely repeated the name of the title over and over again and I found that the animation for the number itself was scary and just disturbing. I wouldn't let my children see if for fear of them having nightmares.

I think that the animated movies should be left to Disney, because they alone seem to know how to do them right.",2.0

"There's something dopey in almost every scene, including a shot of the Midwich villagers assembled into an angry mob, complete with flaming torches.

It makes me think someone didn't know that ""torches"" is a British word for flashlights.

The dialogue for the alien children is awkward, and the wigs are terrible.

Lots of things don't really make sense.

Why knock everybody out during the daytime instead of doing it at night when most people are already lying down?

You risk killing some of your potential mothers if they happen to be driving.

Why knock the men out at all?

How did outsiders know that something was wrong in Midwich *before* anyone woke up to tell them about it?

(It might make sense if they were unconscious for days and days, but it seems like they were out for only a few hours.)

Why does one of the children have a more human-like mind than the others, and why does one look completely alien?

There's no explanation. It's just the writer's whim.

Also the title is bad because it makes the movie sound supernatural when it isn't.

(I don't like the book's title either. ""The Midwich Cuckoos"" sounds silly, and the metaphor doesn't hold up well because cuckoos don't kill their parents. Instead they kill other children, which is the approach taken by ""The Godsend"" and ""Orphan"".)

The government stupidly bombs the town even though the kids have already moved to a barn outside the city limits. Worse, we don't get to see it.

The airstrike is never shown.

I was also disappointed that these kids with the ability to control adults' bodies never use it to do anything besides hurt people (usually killing them).

The kids don't seem to have any goals or interests. They just walk around killing people who have hurt them or seem like a threat. They do nothing else.

Also, the self-defense aspect of some of the killings somewhat contradicts the movie's premise that the children are evil.

Overall, there isn't much to like. There were some interesting ideas, and it was nice to see Christopher Reeve walking and healthy, but that's about it.",2.0
"The songs in this animated picture are the most exxagerated I've ever heard. IT is like if a character in a movie, for example, couldn't simple ask for a couple of coffee: he would have to do so singing ""please,  give me a cup of coffee, because I love you and life is beautiful and  coffee is good for health.."" Blergh. The technical aspect is  brilliant, but the history is marginally told, the influence in children  (if any) is questionable, because you have to have some age to get to  understand this picture. Anyway, anything coming from Spielberg doesn't  surprise me (although Katzenberge, obvioulsy, was the mastermind behind  this project) because Steven only wants money.",2.0
"Even with the stellar cating providing voices for the characters (reaching almost perfection) this film fails, because probably Katzenberger wanted to beat Disney in their own terrain.

"I've loved most of John Carpenter's strange, quirky film output. And his bizarre casting choices have tended to enhance most of his films, rather than hurt them. I can't imagine what happened here. The wonderful Christopher Reeve was horribly cast, and was really not able to make much impact here. Kirstie Alley as a government scientist? TERRIBLE. Linda Kozlowski from ""Crocodile Dundee"" acted circles around her! Now that's saying something. And Mark Hamill? Basically acted like he was at a booth at a sci-fi convention. He just did nothing. There were some good effects, and the ending was effective, but I expected so much more. This has got to be Carpenter's low point. Michael Par was so/so. Big surprise! Kind of nice to see Peter Jason, a member of Carpenter's ""stock company"". Compared to this crap, Ghosts of Mars (2001)  was Gone With The Wind!!

Village of the Damned (1995) (Ws) is the remake of the 1960 horror classic with the same title. Carpentener's version of the story is not nearly as frightening and Christopher Reeve does an alright job in the role of the doctor. The special effects feel a bit cheap and the music could have been better. Considering that the 1960 version is a classic in the genre of horror maybe Carpentener should have realized that any attempt on his behalf would never equal that of the original.  It is not a dreadful movie but still it feels boring at times and I often find myself comparing how amazing I really thought the original movie was. 2/5.,2.0
"Although the most prolific of the 70s directors who worked their way up from superior exploitation to the mainstream, John Carpenter's flame may have burned the brightest but it also burned the most briefly before he descended into lifeless hackwork. Even the more promising projects floundered when confronted with his increasingly pedestrian handling. His 1995 remake of Village of the Damned is a classic example. Ill-advisedly relocated to a California coastal town inhabited by Superman, Luke Skywalker and Crocodile Dundee's girlfriend, the special effects are more prominent and the body count is multiplied more than ten times as villagers burn themselves to death, impale themselves, doctors blind or perform autopsies on themselves, all staged with remarkable flatness and a complete lack of atmosphere or foreboding. A few good ideas are thrown in, but aside from one schoolroom sequence and the foolproof ""brick wall"" ending, it's desperately dull and under characterised stuff that feels like it was made by a wage slave reluctantly punching a time clock every day. More like Village of the Darned, the most mysterious thing about it is just how Michael Pare managed to get such prominent billing when he doesn't even make it past the title sequence.",2.0

"John Hughes, the guy who created a string of teen comedies in the 80s, portrayed teenagers as whiny and self-absorbed with questionable humor.  Hughes' version of high school is always a cartoon version of adolescence.  None of the kids in this movie seem like they are really abused (except maybe Bender, but it's hard to tell), so by the time they all share their true feelings about how tough their lives are because...parents and reasons, it all falls flat.  It's no wonder Generation X got labeled as self absorbed.  Hughes and his movies do a disservice to the intelligence of teenagers of any age, but particularly to anyone who was a teenager in the 80s, when (in this movie universe) the well-off, white teenagers just have a pity party over practically nothing.",2.0

"Works as a decent 90s martial arts movie. As a Bruce Lee biopic, leaves a lot to be desired. Overdramatized, extremely cheesy and shockingly inaccurate for a film that claims to have Linda Lees blessing. The most fun to be had are the faithfully recreated iconic sets from the original films. Jason Scott Lee is a good actor but sadly miscast and poorly directed into an ugly and unintentionally goofy caricature with none of Bruce Lees charm, grace and explosive power.

"Wow, hard to finish this one. I am sure in its day it was considered much better, and for many there may be a nostalgia factor.  But Spielberg (and a great wasted cast) aside, this one's a stinker. First of all, the cover is very misleading. Despite his prominence on the cover, Belushi is barely in this movie until the very end (which is the best part of it if you can make it that far). For that reason alone I felt compelled to give fair warning.  This is simply not really a Belushi movie.

You may love the Blues Brothers.  You may love Animal House. You may love Stripes.  You may love Akroyd, Candy, etc.  Chances are however you will not even remotely like this.

On the other hand if you do like this movie, this appears to be a fine blu-ray upgade.

If I had known...I wouldn't have bought it.",2.0
I have to say this movie is terribly exaggerated and untrue. Especially the scene in the movie where Bruce Lee is getting beat up and has to fight for his life in the ice house. This part of the movie never happened. Bruce Lee never got beat up and he never fought the gung fu San Francisco man's brother. Bruce Lee also never got his back broke in a fight. Bruce suffered a pinched nerve in his back through improper weight training. Any true Bruce Lee fan knows this movie is not accurate. If your going to do a movie about Bruce Lee at least make it accurate. I gave 2 stars instead one out of respect for Bruce. However I don't believe Bruce would have ever approved of this film.,2.0
"Whatever merits this movie could have as an entertainment vehicle, it was lost due to one simple reason: its title is ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee STORY"". I repeat: THE BRUCE LEE STORY""!! So don't come to me saying (like a lot of reviews here say) that this is just fiction loosely based on Bruce's life.

Once you say ""Bruce Lee STORY"", the limits of ""changes for dramatic purposes"" are extremely reduced. And, as a fan of Bruce's movies, I watched it expecting to learn something real about his life, not a movie that has practically the whole script fabricated, almost 100% fake! I could not believe my eyes while I was watching it!

The only people who can give this picture a five star rating are the ones who did not watch Lee's movies or don't care about his real life. That's the only explanation. This movie butchered completely the book by Linda Lee (and even so she accepted this untrue version of the life of Bruce Lee).",2.0

The disk player itself makes more bizarre sounds while trying to process this disk than any before it.  If you stop the disk after you start the movie, it goes right back to the very beginning of the whole process - if you pause it too long, it goes back to the very beginning as well.  I have blu-ray disks that ask me if I want to continue watching from three months ago, so I know this disk is different.

"This film's main significance is merely the fact that it was directed by Steven Spielberg.  Thus, one can see the origins of the type of action scene composition that would serve him so well in films like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  This film seemed to be an exercise for him in developing that particular style.  Good for him.  Too bad it wasted so much money and material on such a technical exercise, because as a story I found it pointless.  Many ""comedies"" leave me cold and unimpressed, and this was certainly in that category - the kind of comedy that simply revels in disorder for its own sake.  Obviously there are people who love that and keep seeking out this sort of comedy.  I hadn't realized Spielberg was one of those persons.  Too bad - I don't see any value in presenting things as merely simplistic and chaotic.  One-note characters abound here.  The gal who is only interested in sex and airplanes.  The tons of guys who are only interested in sex.  The dude who wants to beat up all who disagree with him.  There is not an ounce of good humor in any of that - such a dismal view of humanity is in fact quite depressing to me, and thus I found this extended version of the film even harder to sit through than the original.  We have about an extra 30 minutes of that pointless dreck filling the screen.  Not every character is so unappealing, though.  I actually enjoyed Eddie Deezen and the ventriloquist dummy.  Robert Stack's role was fun.  But they have a total of perhaps 20 minutes between them?  I enjoy Dan Aykroyd.  He added another 5-10 minutes of interest (but not actual laughs).  It was interesting to see John Belushi after all these years, but unfortunately I didn't find him to actually be funny.  Like Treat Williams, he did a great job at playing the kind of person that I would want to avoid.  Treat Williams was actually more effective, I think, in being comical by overplaying such a simplistic character.  When the two get together, one expects fireworks - the actual result was very interesting but again not particularly funny.

In the end, the film does have various points of interest, but simply doesn't work for me as a coherent film.  I speculate that those who enjoy learning about and understanding the world prefer drama, in which characters are driven to seek order and meaning in their lives.  Then there are apparently the kinds of people who like this film - apparently they seek some sort of cathartic release by seeking chaos and pointlessness in their entertainment.  So it's probably a matter of personality.  I like things that make sense, and characters who seek to improve the world or at least their own conditions, by making sense of it - not people who think there is value in pure destructiveness and wild behavior.  I hate such people in real life, so why would I want to see an entire movie about them, let alone pay money to do so?  For those who need some sort of release from order and discipline, this movie might provide what you need, and I hope it's healthier to watch this than to simply get drunk or to actually go out and vandalize things for fun.  But it's a sorry thing to see ""art"" that reduces the world (let alone war themes) to this gigantic rowdy ruckus.  I can't even just dismiss this film as childish, because I didn't even care much for it when I saw it as a child upon its first release.  Instead, I believe its appeal is a matter of personality.  Those who are into the sort of humor that simply provides release from all responsibility and rationality, and who don't particularly care about people - who like to see people slapped and acting stupidly (or to mock those who dare to act normally and reasonably) are apparently the kind who this film was made for.  I'm surprised that Spielberg is apparently among them.  What a waste this was, except as an exercise that led to better things.",2.0

"Only 2 problems with this DVD: 1) the film isn't funny and 2) the transfer absolutely stinks.

The film has funny bits. It has bits that could be funny. But Spielberg wasn't the director to make the funny bits and the bits that could be funny come together in an even remotely satisfying way. It's too long, it's badly paced, it has too many story lines that are only tangentially related. As another review said, it's not ""Caddyshack."" If you've seen other Spielberg pictures, there's a lot of little ""Easter Egg""-like things in it. Of course, they're not really ""Easter eggs,"" but they're clearly bits of business Spielberg liked. He riffs ""Jaws"" at the start when the skinny-dipper gets set upon by the Japanese submarine. Compare Belushi saluting the crowd from the conning tower of the Japanese submarine in ""1941"" to Harrison Ford saluting the crowd from the conning tower of a German submarine in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark;"" compare the sudden reveal of the ""growling"" T-Rex in the La Brea Tar Pits in ""1941"" to the sudden reveal of the growling T-Rex in ""Jurassic Park.""  And there's other clever bits, like the famous 1-second shot of Belushi as Brando as the Godfather -- a bit Belushi did on ""Saturday Night"" -- during the USO club riot; Robert Stack as Maj. Gen. Stilwell, lip-syncing to the soundtrack of Disney's ""Dumbo;"" and Sam Fuller as the commander of Los Angeles air defense command. Elisha Cook, Jr., has a brief cameo as ""Diner Patron;"" most people recognize him as the ""cheap gunsel,"" Wilmer, that Bogart slaps around in ""The Maltese Falcon.""  Slim Pickens is the most reliable player of them all. There are some not-so-clever bits, too. Tim Matheson essentially plays his ""Animal House"" character, Eric ""Otter"" Stratton, in uniform; maybe it's Otter's father. Nancy Allen essentially plays the ""Mandy Pepperidge"" (Mary Louise Weller) role from ""Animal House."" Christopher Lee is wasted. Toshiro Mifume was probably tempted to actually commit ritual seppuku. And the ""racial tension"" bit between John Candy and Frank McRae is utterly pointless.

On the whole, though, there's some visual appeal here if you can tolerate sitting through the stinky bits. Unfortunately, you can hardly *see* the visually appealing bits. The film transfer is appallingly bad. The lighting is off; daylight is painfully bright yet oddly washed out, night is impenetrably dark. The audio is useless. Sitting 7 feet from the television, my son and I had the volume at 50 -- when on any regular broadcast we'll set it at 18 or 19. The audio has no depth. It's tinny. Voices are mismatched. Maybe Spielberg doesn't care. ""1941"" isn't an important part of his oeuvre. But it's still got his name on it, and this DVD doesn't do that name anything remotely like justice.",2.0

"Steven Spielberg's 1979 film ""1941"" takes place only a week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  World War II has arrived on American shores and California is in a panic with expectations that a Japanese attack is imminent.  This movie could have a been a lot of fun. Heck, Spielberg had a wonderful cast to work with but he just blows it is endless scenes of the characters acting totally idiotic and yelling at each other.  There is a LOT of yelling.  It is so annoying.  This film could have been hilarious but Spielberg goes the route of a total goofball comedy, and a very unfunny one at that, and he's not very good with the comedy chops here with this movie.  ""1941"" is very long and very much a big disappointment.",2.0
"1941(1979) is a mixed bag. This is considered one of director Steven Spielberg's weakest movies. It's been accused of being anti-American. People in the U.S.A. try to defend their country after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Spielberg struggles to combine slapstick comedy with a war movie. 1941 is not a total turkey. The music score by John Williams is very good. The special effects by L.B. Abbott and Greg Jein are quite good. The scene with the Ferris wheel rolling into the ocean was funny!
The scene with Nancy Allen screaming at a ""dinosaur"" was prophetic! Spielberg directed Jurassic Park(1993)! The late, great John Belushi played psychotic fighter pilot Bill Kelso. Spielberg spoofs a scene from Jaws(1975) where Susan Backlinie swims in the ocean and she ends up on the deck of a Japanese submarine. This is the equivalent of having Alfred Hitchcock film a  shower scene of Janet Leigh for Family Plot(1976) and having Leigh get hit by a baseball! 1941 has also been criticized for ""overkill"". In the late 1970's, some movie critics felt that Hollywood green lit projects for scripts that weren't that good. Star Trek The Motion Picture, The Black Hole, The Swarm, and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure were examples. The extras on this DVD make up for the film's flaws. 1941 is worth a look if one has a lot of patience.",2.0
"I'm not going to give this film a one-star ""aweful"" review, but it's bad. The lines are really cheesy and the writers made the assistant principal a sucker, which took away from the realism and credibility of the movie. Start with the cheese. Pick any random moment and you're guaranteed to find some of the corniest and most predictable and unsophisticated dialogue that one can fathom. An example of this cheesiness is when there are three people in the room: Bender, Brian and Claire and Bender said a few lines about Claire, teasing yer, and she said something like, ""stop making fun of me."" What the hell are you, 7? In the real world, high school girls like Claire wouldn't pay douchebags like this any attention at all, let alone be that vulnerable with a background like hers to somebody like him.

Another cheesy line is when Bender and the assistant principal have a heated exchange when Bender tells him to ""eat my shorts"" (which I initially thought originated from ""The Simpsons"") and ""Dick"" (the assistant principal) gives him extra Saturdays of detention for being an ass. Dick then asks him, ""you through?!"" and this supposed ""rebel"" says something as corny in rebuttal as, ""not-even-close, bud."" Haha. Hello, Pizza Hut, can I have some extra Breakfast Club cheese with my pizza?

They even have them all whistling to ""Colonel Bogey March."" Why would they have this supposed ""cool"" guy who ridicules other characters like Brian for being a dork all of a sudden have him whistling this song for squares? And why would the other characters who've found the guy (Bender) obnoxious for being a (four letter word that rhymes with stick), all of a sudden join in, in whistling the song with him?

Another part of the film that took away from the movie was the writers' writing of the school assistant principal as an unrealistic and far-fetched character. They write him as a sucker where it's as if he purposely and intentionally finds ways to be at a distance from the students so that they could act in mischievous manners. This guy's roaming in the halls more so than even the students. He's checking his reflection in the glass, singing, dancing. No principal or teacher does this, especially when he's upset at having to come in on a Saturday to deal with these obnoxious kids.

Bender trolls this guy, and all this school assistant principal can do is stand there and take it and say ""one more, one more"" (meaning Bender stays one extra Saturday for trolling him). That was one of the film's lowest moments. Meanwhile, you have Andrew Clark (Estevez's character) who not only doesn't rebel against or provoke Dick, but even does what he tells him to do (like moving a shelf to keep the door open after Bender takes the screws out from the door), and when the assistant principal isn't satisfied with the results he turns up on Andrew in a way that he doesn't with the guy who's been provoking and insulting him the most (Bender). It becomes unfair and hard to invest emotionally in. The writers play the assistant principal like a sucker. You know Bender took the screws from the door based on his reputation and his behavior with you, so why the hell is he acting like he didn't know who it was? ""Why is that door closed?! Why?! Who closed that door?!"" YOU KNOW WHO DID IT! He even says later on, ""you're not fooling anybody Bender. The next screw that falls out is gonna be you."" Then why didn't you confront Bender and do something about it? It kills the credibility of the movie. It becomes difficult to take it seriously. To make me invest in Dick's character as an assistant principal, I'm supposed to believe that he has the power to make Bender's life hell by punishing him for his actions, but he doesn't have any of that.

People touched on this. It's obvious why this film received the amount of high praise that it did, it's because people watched this growing up and had fond memories of watching a movie that they thought was cool back in 1985 or on VHS, and a movie that they identified with being of that age group/demographic at the time. So they find it difficult to cope with the reality that this film is 1) overrated, 2) cheesy and 3) has a critical dumbed-down cast member (assistant principal). Thankfully, you guys had me here to show you the light.",2.0

On top of that, there's this fuzzy, vaseline-on-the-lens effect to much of it, which I assume was the intent of the filmmakers and not a flaw of the DVD. But it's really pretty distracting now. And even though the DVD has a 5.1 audio track, the audio is distorted and clipped.

If you really want to own this movie, wait for (or look for) an anamorphic transfer that has an improved soundtrack.",2.0
"If the book EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS is to be believed (a fun book to read about Hollywood in the 1970's), Steven Spielberg, despite making the colossal blockbusters JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, envied the success John Landis found with NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE.

So much so that he made 1941.

I was in high school when it came out and I can't tell you how much I looked forward to seeing it: Belushi, Aykroyd, John Candy, Spielberg and huge budget of special effects.  How could it NOT work?

But it didn't.  I even went back to see it again, wondering if I'd just MISSED all the laughs.

The first thing I noticed was that the timing was completely off.  The camera doesn't let go of anyone who screams.  The characters are all buffoons.  Like CADDYSHACK, the main characters are uninteresting but, unlike CADDYSHACK, the real comedians don't break out in their scenes.

Maybe Rodney Dangerfield should have been General Stillwell.

1941 has its moments.  Belushi has a great entrance.  Uber-dork Eddie Deezen's ventriloquist dummy spotting the Jap sub is funny.  Aykroyd donning pany hose and two oranges to declare, ""I'm a bug!""

Unfortunately, those moments are too few.  Most of the time, I wouldn't think, ""That was funny.""  I thought, ""Wow, that looked expensive.""

But I have to agree with my college roommate from years ago: ""A movie can't be all bad that ends with a house falling over a cliff.""",2.0
"I saw ""1941"" as a teenager during it's original theatrical run. At that time I thought it was loud and chaotic and only sporadically funny. Before you had a chance to laugh something else was getting blown-up or destroyed. If I didn't particularly like this movie in the first place why would I purchase it on DVD? Because, I've come to believe that Spielberg has become possibly our greatest American director and I thought maybe I had missed something in this early work. Guess what? I didn't. The movie has a number of great actors in it's cast but there is so much mayhem and screaming going on that they get lost in the shuffle. The movie's nominal star, John Belushi, plays what is essentially a pale shadow of his ""Bluto"" role in Animal House. The movie's obvious inspiration is ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World"" but ""1941"" makes that film look like a drawing-room comedy. However, do I recommend this movie? Well, there are a few laughs amid the chaos and if you are interested in the development of Spielberg's career(this is not his worst movie;that honor goes to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"").

 Also, if you are interested in the career of Robert Zemeckis, he co-scripted this film.",2.0

"Every film maker, at some point, has a big flop in his time.  Some of them have more, many more.  Steven Spielberg is lucky to have had only two of them.
That said, however, ""1941"" is still not a very good film.  This is the only film of Spielberg's (aside from the equally bloated HOOK) that I could do without in my video collection.  It is loosely based on a wave of war hysteria that broke out in Los Angeles when a Japanese sub was spotted off the coast (an event that actually took place in February 1942; the story backdates it to a week after the Pearl Harbor attack).
Starting from a (presumably) hysterically funny screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (who would later do BACK TO THE FUTURE), with help from right-wing gung-ho schlockmeister John Milius, Spielberg assembled a huge cast of stars: Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Belushi, John Candy, Nancy Allen, Tim Matheson, Treat Williams, Robert Stack, Warren Oates, Slim Pickens, Lionel Stander, Dub Taylor, and many, many more.  He also got a first-rate technical crew with him, which resulted in ""1941"" picking up three Oscar nominations.  And there are certainly explosions, sight gags, jitterbug dances, facial mugging, and fight scenes by the score.
The problem, however, is that very little of it is actually FUNNY.  Isn't that what comedy is supposed to be?!  A lot of other reviewers here said that they laughed their heads off.  I won't dissuade them from feeling that way, but all I can say is that I didn't.  This wasn't an out-and-out laugh riot like AIRPLANE!; and if it was intended to be a political satire, it fell way short of the mark.  There are laughs in it, but it never manages to be consistently funny from start to finish.
John Williams' unusually jaunty music score is the best thing about ""1941"".  Other than that, however, this is a thirty million dollar clinker, one that thankfully Spielberg bounced back from.",2.0
"I began collecting DVDs recently and the only disc I regret buying thus far is 1941.  You see, I was tempted by the exhaustive extras and the chance to see Spielberg's director's cut.  Don't fall into the same trap,  dear readers.  This film is bad.  I got as far as 25 minutes in and decided  I couldn't take anymore.  It's a film which believes that there is a  goldmine of comedy to found in shouting, falling over, and then shouting  again.  Not funny.  If sitting in front of an animated corpse was bad  enough, it turns out the extras are a chore, too - the dullest being a very  long, very boring documentary about the making of the film in which all  involved (who should have known better) recount in nauseating detail how  the film came to be.  A waste of time and money - theirs and yours",2.0
"SPOILER ALERT

Either I was way too old to see this movie for the first time or I have never fully recovered from being a high school outcast. Notwithstanding its cinematic merits (working with a tiny budget, writer-director  John Hughes gets some nice performances out of his cast) it struck me as pure fairy tale. If I'd seen it when I was younger, maybe some combination of my desire to believe in it and my angst-ridden sympathy with the characters would have made me love it. But at my age, I didn't. I still love Hughes's ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" because it does not strive to be more than the charming frothy fantasy it is. ""The Breakfast Club,"" despite a few jokes at the expense of the vice principal ""supervising"" the detention, takes itself way too seriously.

You have high-school types: a quirkily attractive delinquent stoner (Judd Nelson), a conventionally good-looking athlete (Emilio Estevez), an affluent pink prom princess (Molly Ringwald), a straight-A nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) and a misfit (Ally Sheedy). They all do a Saturday of detention together. Initially they dislike each other, but having nothing to do to alleviate their boredom other than talk to each other, they come to realize that each of them is more than a type as they bare their souls about their problems with school, their parents, sexuality and their cliques (or lack of a clique in Sheedy's case). They get high. By mid-afternoon, Hall's character says he now considers them all friends. Ringwald's character disagrees, certain that even though they may have bonded during their day of detention, on Monday morning, they'll be back with their cliques and ignoring each other in the halls.

By the end of the movie, Ringwald's character makes over Sheedy's character and turns her from a black-clad, black-eyelinered pre-goth to another pink princess and Estevez's wrestler is in love with Sheedy. Virginal Ringwald is in love with delinquent stoner Nelson and plans to date him to get even with her parents. Hall gets over not getting an A in shop class.

I was some combination of Hall and Sheedy's characters. Occasionally in high school I would be thrown in to a situation where I was alone with a girl like Ringwald's character or a guy like Nelson or Estevez's characters and have what I thought was a profound conversation that meant we could be friends, only to find that Ringwald's character was right: Within a couple of days, they stopped seeing or hearing me when I tried to say hello in the halls.

"This is just one of the most overrated films of all time.  Probably because of the emotional investment so many of its fans have in it, as they saw it when they were teenagers, or, just as likely, pre-teenagers.  But even older critics seemed to have suspended their judgment.

Despite having been made in, and so heavily identified with, the 80's, Breakfast Club is firmly rooted in the pop psychology movement of the late 60's/early 70's.  Much of the ""action"" In the film consists of the eponymous ""club""  sitting in a circle and trying to ""break down"" each other's ""walls"" (in the parlance of the times), a trope directly lifted from the 70's pop psychology Encounter Group therapy session of the type seen in films like ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"".  A lot of these scenes are right out of the rule book of the infamous Synanon House of the period, where the ""encounter"" style was far more aggressive, and could turn into an attack on a single person.  This happens a lot in Breakfast Club, to each of the characters.  Most of this psychological terror is carried out by the school bully, Bender, played by then-25-year-old Judd Nelson, who incessantly harasses most of the other kids in room, who are there involuntarily, (for detention).  The only ""kid"" (actually a 25-year old Emilio Estevez playing a kid) to hold his own against him is Andy, ""the jock"".  There's also ""the nerd"", played to the hilt by Anthony Michael Hall, and ""the prom queen"", played by Molly Ringwald, ( about two years away from throwing her career right down the dustbin of history ).  Ally Sheedy plays ""the loner"".

In the weird logic of Hollywood, all of this abuse just makes the kids love Bender more.  Similarly, at other points in Breakfast Club we are repeatedly expected to feel sympathy not for the victims of abuse, but for their tormentors, not only in Bender's bullying actions, but in the Estevez character's whining, self-pitying (and, I might add, seemingly endless) monologue about committing some freakishly creepy sexual abuse on some poor kid.  Apparently, it really hurts to bully people.  The film industry, largely made up of people with Leftist tendencies, often asks us to sympathize with bullies and criminal perps, a couple of the most egregious examples being the bleeding-heart hand wringer Dead Man Walking and the South African film Tsotsi.

The ""encounter sessions"" in Breakfast Club are interspersed with small, generally non-sequitir vignettes of 50's-style teen rebellion, e.g., the crazy, spontaneous dance scene, backed by a soundtrack that was already dated back in 1985.  This little sequence gives the movie its biggest WTF moment, when Estevez lets out a leonine roar, and suddenly a plate glass window shatters ( It plays like some weird fusion of Heroes, Dune,  and Footloose ).  So disjointed is this film that it seems as if several different writers were working on different parts of the movie, and when they were done writing, they just sort of patched it all together in random order.

Worst of all is the way the film resolves itself, as, for no apparent reason, four out of the five kids pair up (guess who gets left out?  Bingo!  ""The Nerd""!  How's that for a depressing message for at least a portion of the audience in a film that fancies itself ""uplifting""?)  In addition, the eccentric ""loner"" chick is turned into a clone of the prom queen (and there's another nice message, this time for the female portion of the audience: conform, girlie)!",2.0

He's like an icon to many Gen Xers, not necessarily because they all like his films (many don't), but because he was the quinessential 80's teenage comedy man.  But this film is probably the most overrated one he ever did.  I thought it was good when I first saw it, but it's really tame stuff masquerading as edgy, pointed teen angst.  The concept itself could have been interesting (a day's detention with 5 typical high school types, the nerd, the spoiled queen, the druggie, the jock, and the ""alternate"" chick), and it's surprising that Hollywood greenlighted a film with no real plot like this one (Hughes had major pull in those days).  But the execution is really pedestrian.  I especially dislike the ending, in which the alternate chick cleans up and ends up with the jock (never happen), and the druggie and the queen together was even more preposterous.  It's ridiculous.  It completely undermines the entire story of the 5 castes of teenagers.  There are a few choice moments (the man who played the principal was quite funny at times), and some of the dialogue is decent, but overall it will mainly be remembered for a nostlagia trip for 80's kids.",2.0
"Don't let this one fool you.

While this angst-filled detention-as-confessional `80's Brat Pack flick is hailed as a banner of youthful freedom, the final resolution can't be viewed as anything but a Big Brother-ish commercial for the joys of conforming to what's socially acceptable. Think about it. Remember when the it-girl transformed the individualistic outsider into the image of what was in, and suddenly the loner became happy and accepted and wanted by the cool guy? A terrible message for anyone, but especially for kids forming a sense of self awareness.

The Breakfast Club isn't a very good movie but obviously it somehow strikes a chord with enough people for it to have classic status and be fondly recalled on best-of lists and has been paid tribute to on everything from songs to an episode of Dawson's Creek.

Horror is what they find, and Babe has to rise to the occasion to save the day.  The themes and moods of this movie are much different than the first one.  Whereas the original Babe was very lighthearted, with occasional scenes of suspense and thorror, this movie is the opposite.  Here there are mostly scenes of suspense, with only some lighthearted scenes.  The comedy is not that good, but the special effects are a lot better.  The overall look of the movie is darker too; instead of a city with bright greens under a blue sky, we have concrete, roads, and building walls.  This reviewer did not like this movie that much, and was disappointed.",2.0
"""One of the best of 1998""?  Please.  Babe:  Pig in the City is a crushing disappointment, full of show-offy camera work, animal torture, and jarring elements that never even come close to becoming a story.
George Miller may have co-written the original Babe, but his work on this sequel only proves that Babe director Chris Noonan deserves more of the credit on the success of the original.  In Noonan's hands, Magda Szubanski was a lovable buffoon and comic relief; in Miller's, she becomes an over-acting victim.  In Noonan's film, the piglet Babe was a polite, not very bright, yet thoroughly lovable character with loves, fears and flaws; in Miller's, Babe becomes an entirely passive character, and his experiences and emotions are kept from us at arm's length by Miller's messy scripting.  Most grievously, there is not a single likeable character in this film.  The ""cynical chimps"" have overwritten lines, the dogs and cats never go beyond facetious posing, and the farm animals that the first film painstakingly set up for us are reduced to a handful of lines in the beginning.  Even Babe himself, still adorably voiced, doesn't generate much pathos, because the story is so outlandish and unfocused that we have no basis for feeling for Babe's experience of them.  Miller was simply so busy trying to make this a ""darker"" film that he forgets to make it into an engrossing one.  While he shoots some interesting visual gags, these never form a coherent sequence of events, let alone an engaging story.  If Miller had had the good sense to retain James Cromwell's crucial Farmer Hoggett character, he would have still had some chemistry to play with.
And yes...there's the animal cruelty.  A drowning dog, dangling by its foot on a chain; the pig being brutally assaulted by guard dogs...I for one don't find this stuff entertaining at all, nor does it make any kind of statement other than that the filmmakers are desperate to impress us with more animal stunts.  The first film had moments of danger, but these were always handled sensitively and within the confines of the animal world, making them naturalistic and emotive rather than manipulative and cruel.  I can literally feel the hand of the director at the end of that chain dangling the dog into the river, and it's a downright nasty feeling.  Miller makes me even more incensed because he tries to cloak the cruelties in false moments of exaltation, but it's futile.  The characters are so poorly drawn and our sympathies so indifferent to any of them that there's nothing to justify what Miller puts these poor animal actors through.
I give this film two stars because this film does have some complex blocking of animals into dramatic contexts.  Unfortunately, these are also more impressive than engaging, for the characters just don't generate much interest because we have no sympathy for any of them.  I marvel at the technical achievement of the technical teams, matching complex dialogue to animals' mouths and training them to touch each other, high-five, and kiss, while remaining unmoved by the dramatic situations.  The first film achieved much, much more with less dazzling effects, just by making you attached to the animals.  If Pig in the City only had one character like Rex, with a complex and touching back story and emotional motivation, it would not be such a bust.
George Miller may have co-written the first Babe, but here he single-handedly strangled a nice movie franchise with his ""dark"" sensibilities and need to dazzle with camera tricks and ""breakthrough"" animal manipulations.  I'm as big a fan as you'll find of the world of Babe, but I'd say skip this one.  The box office results, for once, are an accurate gauge of quality.",2.0
"Not as good as ""Babe"" by a long shot.  Still the characters we continue to follow act as we would expect.  Frankly I'm not sure why the film creators felt the need to go to a city to further Babe's adventures.  I'd recommend strongly that you watch it on television or rent it with some others before investing your money in it.",2.0
"The first movie, Babe, was cute and funny and very Disneyesque.  This bizarre sequel is more like a Fellini film.  It begins with a disturbing nightmarish scene of the farmer (from the original Babe) falling down a well.  Shortly after, it moves the setting to the city.  The animal characters in the city are not cute and cuddly like on the farm.  There are strange and bizarre personalities to most of them.  The imagery is equally bizarre... the use of close-ups and slow motion effects for some of the stranger things makes the oddity more intense.  There is a psychotic pit-bull who consistently tries to kill Babe.  There is a lame Chihuahua using a wheelchair type of wagon to get around.  There is a manic depressive orangutan, and a family of crazy chimps.  Then, there is the clown character (played by Mickey Rooney) who has more sadness in his life than joy.  The whole thing is just so surreal and depressing.
On its own merit, Pig In The City stands as an interesting and unusual movie, especially for fans of Felliniesque films.  But, compared to the predecessor, Babe, this one is like Hell to its previous Heaven.  If you like bizarre movies, you might like this.  But, do not... I repeat... DO NOT let your kids see this one!  It's definitely not a family movie... unless you're the Addams family!",2.0
"The origianal Babe movie was wonderfull.  It was like a live action disney movie where annimals talk.  Now we have the sequel and we have to ask ourselfs, what the heck went wrong here?  Babe 2 is one of the worst sequels to a movie I have ever seen.  Its incrediably dark, disturbing and very unpleasent.

The film starts off right where the first one ended, with farmer Hogget returning to the farm to live happily ever after, but sience this is a sequel, we cannot let that happen.  So Babe accidentaly pushes Farmer Hogget into a well and nearly kills him.  While he is recovering, the happy cheerfull bank people show up and tell the Hoggets that they are about to loose the farm.  So Ms. Hogget decides to head into the city with Babe and make some money.  When they arrive they eventually reach a hotel in what has to be the most bogus city set I've ever seen.

After that the typical bad stuff happens and its a lot worse then before.  The annimal cast consists of really mean dogs, annoying bossy Godfather like apes and a whole lot more.  The only nice annimals are Good natured Babe, some cute Kittens, and Ferdinand the Duck.  All the other annimals are making Babes life really miserable.

While at first Babe 2 seems charming, that instantly jumps out the window when you first see the annimal cruelty scenes.  Babe is constantly attacked, a dog is strangled by his chain underwater and nearly drowns, another dog attacks a car and is dead for a few minutes (but he recovers) kittens go hungry, and in a horrifyingly disturbing sequence, the hotel is assulted by annimal catchers.  All this cruelty to annimals, and you wish they would die just to put them out of thier misery.

I was shocked at how un-kid friendly this is.  I recommned that you don't take your kids to see it, it will diminish the fond memories of the first one.

The Good: Its a Babe movie, The narrator does a great job, some nice annimals

The bad: really really dark(and not in lighting sense), awful sets.

and the ugly: Lots of annimal cruelty scenes, the apes and dogs are very annoying, definatly not for young kids.",2.0

"""The Breakfast Club"" is the brat pack movie that I venture to guess will be long remembered as a watershed moment in American cinema - at least where teen comedy is concerned.  The plot (for those not already familiar with it) revolves around 5 teenagers from various walks of life, forced to sit together through one Saturday afternoon detension session. A hilarious, well-crafted and often poignant film about the fundemental truths that make us all human, John Hughes ""The Breakfast Club"" is perhaps the single greatest exploration of the angst and confusion that plagued us all during the high school years.
UNIVERSAL's remastering efforts on this DVD provide some angst of their own. Despite being anamorphically enhanced for 16X9 displays, this newly minted DVD offers nothing in the way of video improvement over the previously issued DVD.  Colors are dated, unrealistic, often unbalanced with some bleeding and smearing.  Fine detail is minimal, even in well lit scenes.  Contrast, shadow and black levels are all extremely weak. Age related artifacts, including chips, scratches and spice jump cuts are all evident. There is a considerable amount of film grain present throughout for a wholly unsatisfying visual presentation.  The audio - remixed to 5.1 in both Dolby and DTS exhibits a dated characteristic with muffled dialogue and practically no spacial separation, except in the music tracks.
EXTRAS: A Theatrical trailer that is badly worn.
BOTTOM LINE: ""The Breakfast Club"" is a brilliant movie.  However, the lack of extras (a documentary would have been nice)and the really low brow treatment of the transfer lead me to say this disc really isn't worth the money.",2.0
"I found John Hughes 1985 movie The Breakfast Club to be an extremely generalized, heavy handed, piece of trite filmmaking that may or may not have been relevant to teenagers fifteen years ago, but is certainly nowhere near on target now.
 Obviously it was by design that his five main characters were one-dimensional character sketches of so-called traditional high school stereotypes.  You have Andy the jock (Emilio Estevez), Claire the princess (Molly Ringwald, a John Hughes staple), Bender the criminal (Judd Nelson), Brian the nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), and Allison the basket case (Ally Sheedy).  In my opinion, for Hughes to insinuate that these five people come from completely different backgrounds and had absolutely no contact with each other or anyone else from their particular type during school is just plain silly.  For example, it is quite likely that Claire and Andy, being popular people, would know each other, or at least that princesses and jocks would interact on a regular basis.  Same thing goes for Bender and Allison as social outcasts.  Only Brian, being the brain, would logically be shunned by all other classes.
For another thing, these categories have little relevance today because in todays modern society, and indeed this has always been true, teens simply cannot be categorized and labeled, even by their peers, in this manner.  I myself saw elements of my personality in every one of the characters, and neither I nor anyone I know would fit neatly into these stereotypes.
 The last thing Im going to gripe about in this review is, logically enough, the ending.  For a film that tried so hard to be edgy, the denouement was awfully hackneyed and predictable.  Four out of the five characters hook up at the end?  Gosh, I never saw that coming!  Also, the treatment of Allison was laughable.  This girl has serious psychological issues that have been with her all her life, but all she needs is a little makeup, a nice dress, and a clean-cut boyfriend to set her to rights?  I don't think so, pal.  Willful suspension of disbelief is all fine and good, but to trivialize Allisons pain and emotional trauma in this manner is irresponsible and does a disservice to those young people who do identify with her character.  I think thats enough bashing for this film; while it had its moments, it certainly is by no means the classic that it is reputed to be.",2.0
"I gather from some other reviewers that I should have read the book first, but now I have no desire to read the book after the movie left me feeling so unsatisfied.  I guess I just didn't ""get"" this movie.  What I got at the beginning was that Ellen loves her mother but is positive she never wants to become her mother.  I definitely got that Ellen was justifiably enraged as she became aware of her father's transgressions against his marriage and his family, and his demands that Ellen move home and take care of not only her mother's needs but his as well.  Meryl Streep was endearing as Ellen's dying mother and I felt admiration for how she expertly cares for everyone around her and makes it seem so effortless, and I get Ellen's frustration with trying to step in and do all the things her mother does when it feels so unnatural and unappreciated.  (""I cooked the whole Thanksgiving dinner and no one even noticed!"")  But in the end, the mother passes away and nothing really seems resolved.  Ellen will return to her life, perhaps wiser but probably with lingering bitterness.  Her father will no doubt return to his same routine, feeling sadness at having lost his wife but in no way devastated by it, and though it seems that Ellen's anger toward him has dissipated at the end, I didn't feel like their differences were at all resolved. Also I would have liked to have seen a stronger bond develop between Ellen and her brother, but we don't even see him after the mother's death.  And the whole question of who, if anyone, helped administer the overdose of morphine - I guess that was supposed to illustrate a final act of love and sacrifice from the woman who took care of everyone and everything - but to me it just seemed a pointless part of the story.  The movie was not at all the poignant mother-daughter story that I thought it was going to be.  Very disappointing.",2.0
"I expected something more from this film. Meryl Streep is always good, so she cannot be faulted. She plays a housewife and mother who adores happiness and doing things that are kind and good and loves to be the housewife. She becomes ill with cancer, and her semi-distant daughter, played by Rene Zellweger, comes home to take care of her. The problem here is that Zellweger is not believable in this role. She is supposed to be a hard-hearted and aggressive New York magazine reporter. She supposedly has a reputation as being very cold and heartless, but she does not give this character any convincing hardness. It is hard to picture Zellweger in any kind of role like that. She is just too sweet. She sometimes rolls her eyes and gets impatient with things, but she just looks too sweet and compassionate to make us believe that she could ever be an aggressive go-getter. William Hurt is Streep's husband and Zellweger's father. She idolised him and during her tenure as her mother's nurse, she learns a lot of unsavoury things about him. The film is very much about her coming to terms with her illusions about the family and what she felt about them. It also is about her coming to terms with who she is, but it is just so mushy. There are no clear cut lines of where this film is trying to go. Naturally Streep dies and all is basically ironed out, but the film is just so... unmoving. Surprising considering that it was probably made to be a tearjerker, but it fails to be so.",2.0

"The landscapes are gorgeous. The climbing scenes are tense and enjoyable, and the climax was pretty much perfect. Eastwood and Kennedy turned in solid performances, and the art collection that Eastwood's character built up? Yeah, I could believe that that Pissarro alone was enough to tempt a man back into a life of high-stakes wetwork.

That's the good news. Now here's the bad news, along with a quick, spoiler-free summary of the rest of the movie.

Think of the worst Bond movie you've ever seen. Or better yet, put all of your least favorite Bond films in a blender, dollop some of the most self-indulgent and badly researched crap from Ian Fleming's books in as well, then simmer for a couple of hours with characters and lines that are so caricatured, cringeworthy, and largely unnecessary to the story that most hack writers wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pen.

I'm usually a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, and of assassin protagonists and spy-filled plots (yes, the entire James Bond empire of movies and books included, so I know what I'm talking about when I make snarky Ian Fleming comparisons), and I still couldn't find much to like in this movie. If you do decide to sit through this, I suggest watching a Roger Moore movie afterward to cleanse your palate- after watching this, Moonraker starts to look like it deserved eight Oscars.",2.0

(This despite characters with names like Jean-Paul Bidet, Felicity Arce, Randy Knickers and -- my favorite -- Yurasis Dragon.)

"The Eiger Sanction, 1975 film

This movie was adapted from a novel (which I didn't read). I hope the book was a better story.

The first part tells of the recruitment and training for a retired assassin. He will take part in a mountain climbing expedition on the north side of the Eiger mountain (a very difficult climb). His job is to determine who is the traitor among the other three men and eliminate them. (Believable?) We meet characters who are part of this story. It seems to be padded out by providing actions that seems unrealistic to me.

When the training is complete he is sent to take part of the climbing team. We meet the others in this party. Can he figure out who is the guilty party and eliminate him in an ""accident""? There is a problem for this party, they ascend the cliff but have not marked out a return in case of danger. What will happen if he can't identify the guilty party? [Is this really the job of a paid assassin?]

I think a poor plot will identify the guilty person as someone who seems the most unlikely. What then? Some of the action seems to be part of an obvious clich. Did they have experienced writer for this film? [Some of the language used would not be acceptable in modern movies.]",2.0

In this movie he looks like a child--10 to 12 years old--who is playing at being a grownup, which makes his drunken antics even more disturbing.

Our culture has changed, as well, since this mess was made. Regardless of where you stand on gun control, I don't see how anyone could find it funny to watch a completely stoned individual waving guns around. It's hard to believe that such a thing ever WAS funny.

"The beginning of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (a.k.a. What Its Like to Be Perpetually High in Nevada) is akin to the ending of Psycho: though youve heard its catchphrase before, it feels fresh when you sit down to watch.  When Norman Bates says in his mothers voice that he wouldnt hurt a fly, our skin crawls, whereas in Fear and Loathing, Johnny Depps delivery of We cant stop here; this is bat country is positively hilarious.  Context is key, and we know from the opening credits of Fear and Loathing that were in for a wild ride by literally starting off in one.

I normally don't like films that are one big acid trip (or, in this case, acid, mescaline, weed, ether, etc.), and Fear and Loathing is no exception.  Though, Depps portrayal of late author Hunter S. Thompson is all too entertaining, even if he does become a caricature at times.  I could have watched Depp swat at imaginary bats in that car for hours.

Fear and Loathings plot relies heavily on the audience having a prior understanding of who Hunter S. Thompson was and what he did for a living, else you're left wondering why this middle-aged dude and his lawyer are spending so much time in Vegas, blitzed out of their skulls.

We don't get a grasp on Raoul Dukes (Thompsons alter-ego, as we learn in a great scene involving a parking lot attendant) being a member of the press, covering a race in Vegas, until were about a quarter of the way in, when Duke contemplates via voice-over: What was the meaning of this trip? Was I just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind? Or had I really come out here to Las Vegas to work on a story? Your guess is as good as ours, Duke.

I thought Dr. Gonzos (Benicio Del Toro) being an attorney was a joke.  Surely, an attorney would keep more of a level head when he has a client like Duke, but no, the seduction of the drugs was apparently too great.  Scarily enough, when Gonzo is sober, Del Toro is actually somewhat comprehensible.  (I swear, the dude is like a Puerto Rican Marlon Brando.)

Fear and Loathing is as littered with celebrities as the Vegas strip itself, with quick cameos from the likes of Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, Flea, and Gary Busey, Ellen Barkin, Mark Harmon, Harry Dean Stanton, Penn Jillette, Christina Ricci, and even Verne Troyer (remember him?).  And yes, when Duke sees a future version of himself in a tripped-out haze, that is indeed Thompson, making an uncredited cameo appearance as himself.

Whats interesting is that all of these stars are credited with such bland character titles as Hitchhiker (Maguire), Magazine Reporter (Harmon), or Highway Patrolman (Busey)  a character who clearly has a name, as is indicated by his badge.  This suggests to me that when you're as saturated in drugs as Duke is, and for as long as he is, people lack significance.  Unless, of course, other people being insignificant had nothing to do with the drugs at all.

But the drugs, oh, those are referred to by name of course, and often.  Duke explains nearly every drug they take while they're taking it and the experience that each one brings, hallucinating images of blood-soaked floors and stretched out faces.  Fear and Loathing is as much a love letter to drugs as it is to Nevada (though, I must admit, Im sold on that carousel bar).

One thing that can be said about Depp is that the man surely loves his job, so much so that he makes you want to be an actor, too.  Im willing to bet that this is why he tends to veer toward crazier characters.  Despite the fact that he embodies these roles so perfectly, though, you can always tell that its still Depp under the make-up.  He never loses himself so completely as, say, Tim Robbins did in The Shawshank Redemption  save for maybe his portrayal of Sweeney Todd.

I remember reading that during the filming of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Depps daughter came down with a serious E. Coli-related illness, which no doubt influenced his work, allowing him to bring an exceptional brand of darkness to the role in a performance that ultimately earned him an Oscar nod.  So he didn't win  I doubt he minded.  Depp seems like the kind of person thats grateful to be able to wake up every day and do what he does; an Oscar win would probably be nothing more than a cherry atop an already fulfilling cake.

I remember learning in film class once upon a time that the voice-over technique can be frowned upon, as it is often overused as a lazy method of exposition, rather than the showing, not telling that film is supposed to accomplish.  (Thats why they call them moving pictures.)  Voice-over is rarely done well, though I imagine that its easier to execute it properly when adapting the film from a book, since the material basically writes itself.

"Maybe it's a cultural difference, maybe it's an age thing, however I felt like this movie is populated by a whole lot of awful characters that have no redeeming quality, and whose comedic value is next to zero.
Why most Americans find hazing, bullying and abuse such a treasured and amusing part of their forming years, is beyond me.

The only happy ending for the movie, would bee to see the city center overran by Al-Queada, where they proceed to slit the throat of every single character in the cast, and then finally the whole town is nuked into oblivion.

The video quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent.  I give it a 10.0 out of 10.  I did not see any grain at all.  Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, which was okay, not outstanding.  There just wasn't much sound out of the surrounds.

There was not anything about it that I found particularly memorable, I disliked the characters immensely, it all seemed like an overscripted drama at a nearby theater. This film is considered as a cult classic and yet I happen to be of the cult that doesn't quite dig this. Johnny Depp is one of the most over-rated actors in the industry. I can't help but blame him for how lackluster and robotic his acting made this. I do not recommend this film at all.

The Blu Ray probably has a better detail level so when the actors are tripping on dinosaurs and dim lights, there is better detail to zero in on how boring the film really was. I'm a big White Rabbit fan but they ruined the song in this unfunny roller-coaster.",2.0
"I am a huge fan of this movie. I've seen it dozens of times, and was so excited when it was released on blu-ray. In terms of the quality of the movie, it's a terrific movie with great performances. I highly recommend it. The only problem I had with this blu-ray is that there are numerous sound effects missing from the audio track. Maybe I had it on a wrong setting or the blu ray i purchased is the only one having this problem, but if the blu-ray is in fact missing audio elements from the original cut, I find it very disappointing. I'm not sure if Criterion Collection plan on re-releasing a blu-ray version of this movie, but If they do, hopefully all the audio will will be included in tact.

"I was ""treated"" to Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" on DVD. Based on the late journalist Hunter Thompson's book, this one had a few very funny moments, and the not-so-subtle message that real-life in Las Vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip, but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars (without paying their bills, of course). It was a step up from Bill Murray in ""Where the Buffalo Roam"", an earlier attempt to bring Thompson's antics to the screen, but still a pretty low step.",2.0
"Unfortunately I tend to divert the critics a lot of the time and a lot of the critics did not like this movie....I however am on the neutral side to this movie...yes it's like being in la-la land with a couple of guys who go on a adventure in which you don't know what it's about half the time but the one reason I liked this is the fact that Johnny Depp (Blow, Secret Window) is damned believable in his performance even though Benicio Del Toro (21 Grams, The Way Of The Gun) sometimes is. The movie itself is one big huge drug endused acid trip circling the air, filling the screen with over-the-top nonsense and digusting dizzy conversations bouncing around off the walls trying to make your head explode. This film just might of giving Depp his weirdest and strange performances ever. Spot cameos by the following: Tobey Maguire (Spider-man 1-2), Craig Bierko (The Thirteenth Floor), Mark Harmon (Summer School), Tim Thomerson (Near Dark), Penn Jillette (Penn and Teller Get Killed), Cameron Diaz (Vanilla Sky), Lyle Lovett (The New Guy), Flea (Back To The Future 2), Gary Busey (Lethal Weapon), Christina Ricci (Buffalo 66)), Michael Jeter (Open Range), Harry Dean Stanton (Paris, Texas), Christopher Meloni (Tv's Law and Order:SVU) and Ellen Barkin (The Big Easy). Look fast for the following actors: Jenette Goldstein (Near Dark), Richard Riehle (Office Space) and Verne Troyer (Austin Powers 2 and 3). Hunter S. Thompson, who just passed away, fans of his might find some value to this movie....and to the rest, I say this once....every movie if crappy or not...watch it once...then if you don't like it...then don't watch it again...that's my advice.",2.0
"I detested the criminal and sadistic violence of a bunch of High School students beating Middle School students with paddles.  I went to High School in the South in the 1970s, and this did not happen.  Ridiculous and cruel.  And the movie had so much potential.",2.0
"This is more or less a re-make of American Graffiti from the perspective of someone who thinks American Grafitti was about a car crash. (According to Wikipedia Linklater commented that high school was not so dramatic as car crashes, it was about getting Aerosmith tickets.)  Fair enough, but American Graffiti was really about the universal experience of having to grow up (with the subtle commentary at the end that 1/2 of the main characters did not grow up - one dies in a car crash, presumably a car crash resulting from a drag race, and another dies in Vietnam.)  Dazed and Confused isn't really about anything, except maybe the banality of high school (and perhaps the banality of the 70's). That is exactly Linklater's point (see http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/07/richard-linklater-filmography). But, that is lost on the later generations who made this a cult classic. If you understand Linklater's point this is as painful as watching Waiting for Godot, if it makes you wish you were in high school in the 70's then the movie basically failed.

Note: American Graffiti had a story.  Dazed and Confused does not, but it seems to have many of the same incidents, but with no particular role to play in the story. Consider this sum up from Variety ""One-liners and dry sight gags still abound, but the ennui-sodden formlessness of Slacker doesnt fly as well in this $6 million, smoothly lensed package, which calls for shapelier narrative and resolution.""

Also, I think it got the 70's wrong.  About 1/2 the cars are 50's classics and there are no station wagons and despite ZZTop's ""Low rider"" it has no low-riders. I kept thinking it was set in the mid-west. It is set in Austin Texas and there are apparently no Mexican/Chicanos -- really?  EVERYONE smokes pot.",2.0
"This, as many before me have cited, is probably one of those stories that should never have left the stark pages of a book.  It's nearly impossible to turn a drug trip into something you can actually film, but success is not impossible.  Just look at ""Trainspotting.""
The book is good.  Not great, but it does leave a resounding feeling behind, which is, for the book, the way to go.  You're left with questions, fears, and some wicked humor.
As a movie however, the compelling story is reduced to a cheap, Halloween party.  People parade around in stupid costumes, making you wonder ""am i laughing at Johnny Depps performance, or the foam rubber lizard next to him?""  It's something you just can't help but feel sad for: ""This could have been so much more...""
The sole reason to see this movie: Johnny Depp.  His performance is good, is an insane way.  Just don't go see this if it's high-class humor you're after.",2.0

"A journalist and his friend go to Las Vegas to cover a race. They also go there on a ton of drugs. This film shows them in colorful Las Vegas freaking out at everything, while on the drugs. During the film we get to hear the protagonists comments on life in America.  It is very bizarre. Now bizarre can be good, but in this case its boring and not very interesting. The characters and story aren't good. You are just thrown in the drugged up world of these two guys, and it all appears very silly. I give this 2 stars, because I can see how some counter culture type people might like this. I hear the book is much better. Some parts are funny, but the rest of the film is nearly unwatchable. If you like psychedelic trips, this film is for you. As the 60s ended, so did the idea that drugs would bring freedom and enlightenment. All it brought were a lot of headaches.
ATTENTION: If you plan to buy this, I suggest you wait until January 28, 2003 when a Special Edition will be released with a ton of extra material, by Criterion Collection.",2.0

"I thought I would love this movie but I didn't.  After two hours of watching two druggies on vacation in Las Vegas, I felt as if I was the only sober person at a party.  It is a movie best viewed when stoned.",2.0
"Well what can I say? I expected a lot out of this movie, especially when two of my favorite actors Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are tag-teamed here. Unfourtantley, the movie couldn't deliver the goods. I am not very familiar with Hunter S. Thompson and thus I haven't read his book but it didn't stop me from watching this movie. Ohh what a movie and how long this movie dragged on and on. The movie hooked me in the beginning with Johnny Depp's ""This is bat country"" quote but it laggs from there. There is not much humor left in the movie. It almost seems that Terry Gillian expects you to have a stoner mentality or just be plain stoned to enjoy this movie, but I didn't. It was hard to sit through this.
The reason I give this movie 2 stars is simply because of Johnny Depp's wicked performance. He truly is a great mimick actor whether he is playing Joe Pistone(Donnie Brasco), George Jung(Blow) or Ed Wood(Ed Wood) this guy can imitate real-life figures so well it's scary. But the performance is not enough to save this mess of a movie. Now for Benicio, well his performance wasn't as good. Benny, Benny, Benny when are you going to learn that you should invest your acting talents in more respectable movies like ""Traffic"". Though it's admirable that he gained weight to play the role his character leaves much to be desired. What's worse all these guest apperances Toby Mcguire, Cameron Diaz, and Ellen Burkin(All fine actors in their own right) come out as farces. They do little or nothing to help this lagging script thus wasting their talents. I don't know maybe the script writer hung out with Thompson in his resort and was taking his own voyage in Gonzo journalism 420 style.",2.0

"It has been said of Fear & Loathing that either you get it or you don't.  I got it, all right.  It plays like a comic strip with unpleasant characters turning mundane situations into vehicles for crime and folly.  Parking a car, entering a bar, watching a motorcycle race, etc. become major ""plot points,"" as our drugged-up drunk heros render themselves incompetent for these simple tasks.  They berate each other, threaten each other with knives and mace, and likewise threaten innocent bystanders.  Meanwhile the narration, laid on with a trowel in homage to the book from which it is taken verbatim, struggles pathetically to impose a higher meaning on these daft proceedings.
Ralph Steadman's grotesque illustrations for the book are accurately realized in the film, and this is the root of the problem.  Steadman drew caricatures of the book's characters; the film brings these caricatures to life as though they are realistic, Rockwell-like portraits of the characters -- and this fatal misrepresentation sinks the film.  Burlesque is diluted with meditation, and as a result the film is neither amusing nor enlightening.
The film is entirely superficial, but even so it veers between hallucinatory distortion and gross caricature, leaving the viewer to wonder at the mental age of the people responsible for this farce.  Alas, some very talented people were involved, not least of whom is Hunter S. Thompson, and they all should hang their heads in shame.
This movie has its share of funny scenes, but five minutes of amusement won't justify two hours of Fear & Loathing.  The scene with Dr. Gonzo vomiting over the side of his convertible as he cruises The Strip, while screaming gibberish about Vietnam and heroin at a carful of middle-aged tourists, is alone worth the two stars I've awarded the film.  But overall, Fear & Loathing is a major disappointment.",2.0
"When I heard about this film I thought I was in for a treat but I guess I was wrong.  Basically about some drug addicts who explore las vegas with every drug you can think of and spend lots of cash during the 70's.  Where is the storyline?  There was no plot and you probably need to be wired in order to understand the movie.  Never was a big fan of Depp anyway, but I do have to recommend Blow and Sleep Hollow.",2.0
"The book fear and loathing in las vegas, by the brilliant Hunter S. Thompson, was a fantastic book filled with social issues like the death of the american dream.  The movie, however, had all of the high points of the book taken out and was turned into a crappy stoner flick.  The high point of this film, is an astonishingly good preformance by Johnny Depp as deranged sports writer Hunter Thompson, aka Raoul Duke.  Buy the book not the movie.",2.0

Instead you are forced to watch Depp fall down, again, and again, and again.  The short movie seems like hours, mostly because it takes the two so long to accomplish simple tasks.  If you still really want to see Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, then at least use it in small doses.",2.0
"This movie is for all those sad people who want to do drugs but don't (and there are a great many of them). Watching these two guys get stoned in Las Vegas is similar to watching two people making love, very deeply unsatisfying. It's one of those things that you've got to do yourself. No amount of watching helps. I watched it because of Terry Gilliam, but he wasn't able to find any artistic tension in the ""anything goes"" atmosphere of a drug binge in Vegas.",2.0
"When released in 1993, writer-director Richard Linklater's coming-of-age portrait resembled a pale shadow of ""American Graffiti"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""

"FOR LOVE OF THE GAME takes you inside the mind of a star baseball pitcher as he plays in what could be the last game of his career.  When I saw the picture at the movies it made me think of the book HEAT, the autobiography  of pro pitcher Dwight  Gooden.  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME and HEAT revolve  around thoughts of family and career as the man on the mound, considered  washed up by some, finds himself in what could be a no-hit game.

Gooden  had his dying father on his mind as he was getting the ball past the bats  on that day in 1996.  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME's Billy Chapel, played well by  Kevin Costner, had thoughts of his late parents.  But unfortunately, the  film puts too much emphasis on Chapel's girlfriend, who may be ending their  relationship.  Aren't girlfriend stories for teenage boys, not 30-something  adult men?  Each time FOR LOVE OF THE GAME's baseball sequences start to  engross you, it cuts to flashbacks about the woman the pitcher has loved so  much through the years that, uh, he never married her?

See FOR LOVE OF  THE GAME on free or cable TV, where Costner, supporting actor John C.  Reilly and the exciting baseball sequences (the director is Sam Raimi of  EVIL DEAD fame) make it worth a look.",2.0
"This movie had so much potential I can hardly stand it.  After the first ten minutes, I thought I was in for a hilarious 'trip' the whole way through.  Unfortunately, the amusing reactions to the various drugs and the  equally amusing narrations by the Duke himself, were replaced with  disgusting, drawn out scenes of vomiting and attempted suicide.  This is  something that needed to be there in some form because of the nature of the  film, but it could have been shortened considerably or just simply alluded  to and replaced with comedy or plot development.  At least I didn't hate it  completely like everyone else I know.",2.0

"This has to be one of the most overrated films from the 90s! While the movie is occasionally entertaining, the mediocre story, generic characters, and moronic behaviors takes away from the overall cinematic experience. I feel that there are better teen comedies about the 70s out there, such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Probably the best aspect of this movie is the soundtrack, but it is NO where near a classic movie that people claim it is.

"I finally saw this movie and for the life of me can't understand why it is so highly thought of.  When you strip everything away it's just a stoner movie with an awesome soundtrack - the problem is, the film's not's very funny or interesting.  There's the meandering storylines (since everyone is either drunk or stoned through most of the movie I guess we don't need a real plot), the glut of way too many characters whose names you can't even remember at the end of the movie, the weird obsession of the male jocks to pound the butts of younger boys with paddles, the female hazing rituals that sexualize the young freshman girls in uncomfortable ways, and perhaps most importantly, the creation of a false 1976 reality that no one actually experienced. In this world, the students roam free in the high school (with hardly a teacher around), pot and beer are freely available to any underage person who wants them, and hardly anyone in the whole town seems to have a curfew.  As another reviewer noted, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a far superior coming of age film with a lot more believable situations and sympathetic characters.",2.0

I just kept thinking its going to get better, there is going to be that moment in the movie where I can believe in the characters.  Needless to say it just didn't happen.  I loved H.

No even a rental to me.",2.0
"I was attracted to this DVD because of its sparkly psychadelic cover, which shows you should never judge a DVD by its cover, cos this DVD was pointless. It's hardly qualifies for a special edition, as there's barely an extras, and to think there are films out there crying out for a special edition but aren't entertained - Titanic for example. There's lot of alcohol & drug (ab)use in this, although the ill-effects are never really shown. The film is more focused on the guys experiences, rather than the girls, and actresses like Milla Jovovich have virtually no lines to say, and just act stoned all the time.

There's some great actors in this, in the time when some of them were virtual unknowns and the rest were unknowns. These include: Jason London,  Adam Goldberg (Eddie from Friends), Matthew McConaughey (really unrecognisable), Marissa Ribisi (Giovanni's twin, who's also in Friends), Joey Lauren Adams, Ben Affleck and Parker Posey. Apparently, Renee Zellweger also appears in this, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her-role (I blinked), but she's not listed in the cast list.

Supposedly, this good looking guy, who's a gazillionaire and a world famous professional athlete really digs her.. Yes, she slept with him on the first date, but she's not a slut... But she really is a little slutty, but whatever, but somehow that's his fault, too.. She likes him, but her ethics won't allow her to pursue a relationship after she slept with him on the 1st date (which was a pure cold call, BTW, slutty), so she brushes him off.. But, then she pops up uninvited to spring training, and faalips out that he's got company?.. WTF?..

Then, lol, she blindsides him with her kid, which I guess was top secret till then(?), and he shows himself to be a good guy and takes care of everything.. And all of the sudden, it's Ozzie and Harriet?.. Meanwhile, the baseball angle, which is much more interesting loses traction while we have to trudge trough the mess of why Kelly Preston is even there?.. lol.. Well, that's an exaggeration, but you get my point..

Finally, fate intervenes, and they come face to face at the airport, and even though this poor guy, who even though he acted like an ass the one particular scene, has been a pretty good guy throughout the movie, pours his heart out to this woman, she still makes the ugly face and starts to cry and is gonna kick him to the curb, at which point, he pours his heart out again..

"HARD TARGET

(USA - 1993)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtracks: DTS / Dolby Stereo

Whilst searching New Orleans for a friend who's fallen on hard times, a brave sailor (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is targeted by wealthy sadists (led by Lance Henriksen) who hunt human prey through the city's underbelly.

It's no surprise to find Sam Raimi's name in the credits of this high-profile entry, the US debut of acclaimed action director John Woo; both men earned their dues in the low budget arena before breaking into mainstream features (on opposite sides of the world), and both have become standard-bearers for subsequent generations of commercial filmmakers. Unfortunately, Chuck Pfarrer's shallow script jettisons the heartfelt melodrama of Woo's Hong Kong output (BULLET IN THE HEAD, HARD-BOILED, etc.) and concentrates instead on action for its own sake, demonstrating a singular lack of trust in Woo's ability to court American sensibilities. The director's visual style remains largely intact, however, including his obsessive fascination with weaponry and gunfire, while Van Damme replaces Chow Yun-fat as Woo's stateside hero of choice (the action star is rendered exquisitely beautiful by Russell Carpenter's worshipful camera).

Needless to say, the action scenes are choreographed with grace and conviction (Van Damme never punches an opponent when a flying kick will do the job just as well!), and Henriksen makes a formidable villain (performing his own fire stunt in one of the film's most breathtaking sequences). But the scenario rings entirely hollow, despite fine production values and a capable cast, including heroine Yancy Butler, boo-hiss henchman Arnold Vosloo, and Eliott Keener (BORN WILD) as a sleazy porn merchant who suffers for his association with Henriksen. Look out for the witty visual homages to both LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962) and OPERA (1987), demonstrating Woo's mastery of the visual medium and his appreciation of movie history.",2.0
"The plot of ""Hard Target"" has been summarized in previous reviews, so I'll limit myself to discussing my favorite part.

""Hard Target's"" claim to fame when it came out was that it was John Woo's first American film, and that's certainly a big deal.  (I just saw ""Hard Boiled"" the other day, and I'd need seven dictionaries to describe that glorious mess.)

But it boggles my mind that Lance Henriksen's jaw-dropping death scene doesn't land right at the top of every review of this movie. I mean... (spoiler alert) the dude has a grenade dropped into his pants.  He manages to get the grenade *out* of his pants before it explodes.  And then he throws it away from him, right? Wrong!  He UNSCREWS the grenade, hoping to separate the fuse from the explosive.  And he DOES separate them before the grenade goes off and starts laughing in triumph.  But he holds the fuse like two inches from the explosive and... THE SPARK JUMPS ACROSS!  Funny enough already, but L.H. makes this shocked ""Whu..."" sound that is more hysterical than the entire first season of the Daily Show.  Right before blowing up.  It's absolutely brilliant.",2.0
"Action Director John Woo's first attempt at making a good American action movie fails with Jean Claude Van Damme (Bloodsport, Sudden Death) on board as the lead hero who jumps over police cars, punches venomous snakes in the head, hops on motorcyles balancing himself on it while he flips over a truck and lands on the ground...kicking a gasoline tank at a guy while he shotgun blasts it and soving a grenade down the pants of evil bad ass Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, The Terminator). Hey, when isn't Henriksen a evil son of a bitatch? Yancy Butler (Drop Zone) is Van Dammes love interest protecting her from the villains trying to kill him and Wilfrod Brimley (TV'S Walker, Texas Ranger) plays Van Damme's southern fried canjun Uncle who rides horses and shoots arrows with his bow while trotting off after his country house blows up. All in all, it doesnt become the worst movie ever made, its only presence if the style John Woo brings to his action scenes...his lingo in the art of which he creates. Also starring Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy and The Mummy Returns) as Henriksen's right hand man. Ah, gotta love the scene where Van Damme has sexual chemistry with the snake while punching it out",2.0
Not special,2.0
"With the exception of some interesting fast balls and watching Kevin Costner sweat a great deal, this film is the story of an off again on again shaky relationship  between Billy Chapel(pitcher for Detroit)(Costner) and his want to be Jane, played by Kelly Preston. Congradulations to Costner who manages to maneuver his way through the entire film without cracking a smile.  Whoops maybe when I took a bathroom break once.
Preston does deserve an award herself-a best agonizer of the year trophy.  Lots of facial distress and we don't even know her real problem until half way through the film.  Lighten up Kelly.  Lighten up Kevin. Is this acting?
The baseball scenes appeal to baseball fans.  I looked at my husband, the great Seattle Mariner fan.  He was captivated by the pitches during the big game(Detroit vs NY) and in the end he shed a tear or two.  Really.  Obviously  it works better if you love baseball.  The story line--wait a minute, I think there is a story line there somewhere.  Oh yes, it is about trust and about trust and about trust.  So trust me when I say  'for love of your money' rent ""Field of Dreams"" instead.""  Or  a great baseball story which is also a great story with wonderful acting. (You even get Madonna in that one) Not to mention Tom Hanks in a momumental role as the boozing manager of a lady's baseball team during the second World War.  "" A League of Their Own.""",2.0
"It's really a difficult movie to watch.  It's like pile and pile of cliche and which is fine if it wasn't topped off with more cliche.  And the music is incredibly awful, not that the songs are particularly bad, it's just way they were assigned to the scenes are horrifying.  I rolled my eyes so many times during the movie that I think I developed a much stronger eye-rolling muscle.  And you know what, I can't really watch Hugh Grant without thinking about a BMW and blowjob anyway...  Really only reason I watched this movie is because I hadn't, and once I start something, I kind of have to finish it.  It is a cute movie, so to speak, but an exhausting movie.",2.0
"Getting ready to watch a Kevin Costner movie is like preparing for a siege: one needs to stock up on a hefty assortment of supplies because, if there is one thing we can be sure of, it's that we are in for a very long  haul. Actually, as Costner movies go, this 138-minute film is relatively  short - though its glacial pacing makes it seem eternal anyway. For sheer,  unadulterated tedium, this movie is, at the very least, a match for  Costner's previous romantic opus, ""Message in a  Bottle.""
Directed, shockingly, by the normally astute and insightful  Sam Raimi ( a bizarre capitulation on his part to slick, empty commercial  moviemaking), ""For Love of the Game"" seems like a film caught in  a movie genre limbo. Half reverential baseball movie and half sappy  romance, it seems catered to satisfy two widely disparate audiences that  wouldn't be caught dead standing in the same line at the local cineplex.  Perhaps, this is a pitch to come up with the perfect date movie (though  ""Titanic"" beat them to it - romance and Leonardo Di Caprio for  the ladies, sinking ship and mass death for the boys).
Costner, in  another of his near-catatonic performances, portrays Billy Chapel, a  40-year old, soon to be over-the-hill pitcher for the Detroit Tigers who,  in a single day, learns that his team has been sold, he is about to be  traded to the Giants and his girlfriend of five years is leaving right that  very moment to start a new career in London. This set-up might have  resulted in an incisive study of a man caught in an age-limited career  learning to cope with the inevitable trauma of saying farewell and moving  on. Instead, the writers settle for a stale movie romance, with Chapel  standing on the mound, pitching his final game and flashing back like mad  to the happier days of ballfield triumphs and blossoming true love. The  film is ostensibly concerned with Chapel's success on the diamond but he  soon learns that even pitching a historical no-hitter and being carried  around in triumph on the shoulders of adoring team members and diehard  admirers is mere ashes without that one true love to share it with. The  screenplay, in fact, is so heavily weighted in the direction of the affair  he is having with Jane (Kelly Preston) that baseball fans are sure to feel  slighted - until the very end.
Even in the ballpark, though, the film is  a failure. Why do so many movies, including this one, treat baseball as  some sort of holy rite, some sacred mission replete with corny imagery,  nauseating pep talks and cliched, slow motion views of tear-soaked faces  amid the euphoric masses? The detrimental effect of ""Field of  Dreams"" cannot be overestimated. Just once couldn't we see a film that  treats the sport for what it is - a fun pastime, completely devoid of  sentimentality?
I will say one thing for this movie though: in  comparison to itself, it does make baseball look like a fastpaced sport!",2.0
"For Love of the Game has its moments, but overall disappoints.  The love story is cliched as hell, but some will enjoy it.  The baseball scenes are good, but the players just didn't seem like major leaguers to me.  Also, I  found the announcers at the game (Vin Scully and someone else) kind of  annoying.  Their banter just didn't ring true.
Costner's performance is  marginal.  One of the central plot elements is his character's balance of  the two loves of his life--Preston's character and baseball.  Baseball has  always been the clear number one, but he finally realizes during his final  game as a player that, hey, maybe he does have room for a woman.  Convenient timing there, Kevin!
If the movie was around 1:30 long it  would have been a whole lot better.  The simple plot just didn't support a  two hour plus run time.",2.0
"For the Love of the Game is about Detriot Tiger's pitcher Billy Chapel. He is in the twilight of his career. His team is in last place, the owner sold the team, his girlfriend is leaving, and he has to pitch against the hated  Yankees.
Billy has a difficult decision to make whether to play another  year or retire. During the game he reminiscence about the good and bad  experiences about his relationship with his girlfriend Heather.

"TL;DR Hugh Grant is charming as usual and has some funny lines, but I don't see the draw to Julia Roberts in this one.

This is supposed to be a romantic comedy where the unlikely pair of main characters are cosmically drawn to each other. The problem is I just don't buy the characters attraction to each other, which the whole movie hinges on. He's a little charming but she relies on her fame to keep him interested, with very little substance. The best movies like this make the viewer fall for the lead, the mediocre ones at least get you to root for the couple. With this not only was I not rooting for the couple, I wanted Hugh Grant to realize his infatuation with Roberts because of her fame was unfounded and find his real true love.

Grant provides a little comedy, as does his disgusting flatmate (though he made me angry more times than made me laugh). I didn't personally find any of the other supporting characters appealing, although it was cool to see a young Hugh Bonneville (from Downton Abbey). I liked seeing sights around London since I am visiting there soon; otherwise the movie was disappointing.",2.0

Let's take some of the best elements from THAT hit, she'll be American, but a movie star- Julia Roberts!  We'll get Hugh Grant to reprise his role.  We'll throw in a like bunch of eccentric, funny friends, some pathos (someone wheelchair bound, a celebrity with no privacy, whatever), a mad, comic rush through London traffic, and the obligatory warm/fuzzy wedding scene at the end, it can't miss!""

I HATE being manipulated, having my chain so shamelessly jerked.  I left a review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-ve-Got-Mail/dp/B001N3LLH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You've Got Mail</a>&nbsp;some time back, noting some of the same tendencies, but I didn't mind quite as much because it succeeded, OK, you GOT me (palpable chemistry between Meg Ryan & Tom Hanks, for one thing)- but this movie DIDN'T get me, just too much to overcome.  For starters, almost no chemistry between Roberts and Grant (largely the lacklustre script's fault, a good script could've generated some). Love 'em both, but not here, together (odd how two people sans chemistry become LESS than the sum of their parts).

Julia Roberts hasn't nearly enough to do, MANY reaction shots, tremulous, tearful smile after tremulous tearful smile [SIMPERING]- Please!  Go in for all the closeups you want of her ""enchanting"" smile, I (and Hugh Grant) need more than THAT to fall in love.  And, we're to believe she's a stunning beauty.  She's not- wonderful, lovely, engaging, definitely, like no-one else, but a great, classic beauty she isn't.  Most importantly, she has FEW decent lines, character development is sadly lacking.  WHY is she with brute Alec Baldwin (whom she whines about, and incidentally, LIES about)?  Plus she alludes to other abusive relationships, past heartbreak, but no details or explanations are forthcoming.  She's a mega-star, one of the wealthiest and most sought-after women in the world, and we're to pity her...WHY?  There are MANY problems with the script, too many to list.  Just one example: they overhear some blokes in a restaurant saying she's a cheap tart, Grant steps up to defend her honor, what does she do?  Makes an insulting comment about the size of their penises(!)- yeah, that should do it- ""SO sorry, our mistake- you're a class act after all.""  Hardly.

Julia drops in on Hugh Grant whenever it suits her fancy (on the flimsiest of pretexts), flirts, kisses, even makes love to him, and then disappears again; every time (except one) he is delighted to see her, smitten, regardless of what she's done or why, how she uses him, an utter doormat.  At one point we're supposed to feel sorry for her because she did naked photo shoots and possibly some porn early on, that have since surfaced, damaging her reputation, and what's more, GRANT is supposed to feel sympathetic about it, and incredibly, DOES.  And BTW, he's the proprietor of a small bookshop, but never seems to be minding the store.  Roberts's mood swings make little sense, they're mere plot contrivances, and lousy ones at that.  The highly contrived press conference scene (supposed to be the affecting emotional slam dunk, with cloying closeups of their patently ingratiating smiles) left me COLD- PLEASE.  What would this spineless doormat and shallow narcissist find so irresistible about each other?

Maybe if I thought about it real hard, or, had a better imagination, I could think that the underlying theme of the film is that a jaded female star, hardened by years of being in the tough, crass film industry, is redeemed by the love of a good man.  But if this was the case it was too subtle for me to see, to feel, should have been played up much more.  If it had, the press conference scene could've been a powerful one in which she's overcome by the fact that someone really, truly loves her, a miracle.  As it was, such an assumption would be pure wishful thinking, because there wasn't enough to base it on, not enough meat, enough meaningful interaction between the two.  Roberts should have been more off-kilter, Grant firmer, more forceful, less tolerant of her movie-star sensibilities and egocentric ways.  Then, when they came together it would've been more powerful, more meaningful, for me anyway.  As it was, I think too much time was devoted to comic elements, plus, too much of an effort was made to make both main characters ""likable"" and appealing, and the filmmakers were largely unsuccessful on both counts.

If there's any reason to see this it might be Hugh Grant, as charismatic and winsome as always (though perhaps a little tired, and as I say, lacking in testosterone).  There are a few funny and endearing moments- the Horse and Hound bit, the personalities of the great supporting actors who play Grant's friends and family (who overcome the material they're given, shine in spite of it, to their credit).  One of these is Hugh Bonneville, Lord Grantham on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B007SQAIN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>, in an early role as an adorable fat loser.  For me, though, the handful of sweet funny moments and even Grant's deft touch aren't enough to offset the myriad flaws, and I won't be suffering through this again.  Instead I'll watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-New-Leaf/dp/B007R2MJXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A New Leaf</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-s-Just-Not-That-Into-You/dp/B002BBJ52U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He's Just Not That Into You</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prelude-to-a-Kiss/dp/B00D3LA6SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prelude to a Kiss</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Time-After-Time/dp/B001BLM15O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Time After Time</a>, all overflowing with chemistry and romantic promise between the leads, and splendid.

It took a lot of will power for Will to tell Anna he wasn't going to let her prance back into his life and break his heart again. Then he goes back to her anyway, and they're in love forever. BS. If the author wants the viewer to believe any of this he should have emphasized that the painting Anna gave Will is an original and she brought it from the US with intentions of giving it to him and making amends (when she sees a print of it at his house earlier in the movie she could have said she has it at home!) then again, it's her last day of filming so when was she intending to give it to him anyway? And why wait until she's filming in Britain again, when it's convenient, why not make a special trip? But alas, instead of emphasizing the paintings significance, the author emphasizes Anna's line ""I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her"" which screams problems and baggage!! She just wants to be loved by a boy, she's not in love with Will!",2.0
Notting Hill is a very overrated and mediocre film.  1999 was a very strong year for films but this was not one of them.  Roberts and Grant played themselves and that is about it.  Its a wacky British drama that is totally unrealistic and not very believable.  I was glad when it was over.  No movie star is going to pick up a book seller in England and then marry them.  I agreed with the film's portrayal of the media but that was done better in films like Network and SFW.,2.0
"I had heard so many good things about this movie, but I didn't like it.  The filming and scenery were lovely, but overall I thought the story was just not a great story - mainly because the character Julia Roberts played was so self-centered and rude, according to her mood.  I had real trouble believing in any real basis for the attraction of the two main characters, especially after Julia Roberts' character had an extremely unjust and childish tantrum that rendered her character almost revolting.  At the end of the movie, I wished Hugh Grant's character had hooked up with the ""nice"" blind date, who seemed a far better person and fit.",2.0
"A by-the-numbers romantic comedy, ""Notting Hill"" is however one of the most overrated movies of its genre. Sure, the lead stars (Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts) have some charisma, Roger Michell`s directing is smooth and subtle, the story has a couple of funny scenes and most of the (very british) cast delivers highly convincing performances. Still, this modern fairy tale about a love relationship between a movie star and an ordinary, middle class guy is not only unrealistic but also almost 100% predictable and unsurprising. The plot shows little original ideas, offering a set of cliches and ""been there, done that"" situations. ""Notting Hill"" is definitely a well made, professional product nonetheless, yet the overall result doesn`t rise above average and uninspired material, a rehash of old ideas and concepts. It`s an alright saturday-afternoon innofensive flick, providing a mildly entertaining cinematic experience that helps to pass the time. A competent Hollywood piece of fluff, but very far from a classic achievement.
An ordinary feel-good movie.",2.0
"None of this rings true, a sentiment apparently endorsed by Roberts who did not believe in a lot of her character's actions, especially over the old photographs. This may explain the lack of chemistry between the two stars and Robert's curiously stiff and un-attractive performance. I didn't believe in the press scrum outside Grant's front door, either. For a start, the police wouldn't accept an obstruction in a narrow street like that, but I won't carp on. There's the odd laugh.",2.0

"I only watched this movie because I was a prisoner on a very long and boring transatlantic flight. Otherwise I would never have bothered.  The  acting wasn't bad, but it was very predictable and both Julia Roberts and  Hugh Grant played their typical typecast parts to the hilt.  I'm getting a  bit tired of Hugh Grant's fumbling, ain't-I-a-kinda-cute airs. But  apparently his affected charm is working.  Julia Roberts stars as Anna, the  beautiful, rich  actress  looking for the audience's sympathy for her  terribly ""difficult"" life. I have a feeling that most women will  love this sappy movie and will be running for the kleenex box big time! I  would  not consider buying this soap opera, but fans of Grant/Roberts might  appreciate it.",2.0
"Wow!  I never wanted a film to end as much as this one.  I know now why it didn't get rave reviews in theatres.  It takes forever to go anywhere and once it ""arrives"" it's leaves you saying, SO WHAT.  The ONLY  bright bit of acting in this movie was Hugh Grant ~ great in his stammering  and perfectly-timed line deliveries and wonderful in the role of the well  meaning, cheerful and simple fellow who falls for the unattainable lass,  Ms. Roberts.  Julia could have done much more with this role, but her  performance left me wondering why she chose to play it like an actress  asleep in front of the camera lens.
Supporting roles were good, i.e.,  Grant's kooky sister and his roommie, Spike.  The soundtrack is nice, and  fits the mood of the story, but if you're looking for a Julia Roberts love  story to end all love stories, I'd pass this one up and rent Pretty Woman  instead.  Sorry folks, just my humble opinion!  She's a good actress and  wasted her talent in Notting Hill.",2.0
"There was a lot of hype before this movie came out about how it reunited Hugh Grant with the creative talents behind Four Weddings and a Funeral. Given that, I was really disappointed by this film. First, having Julia  Roberts essentially play herself while Hugh Grant plays a  ""nobody"" was weird; that scene at the end where they're supposed  to be at one of her movie premieres just looks like they'd shown up for the  gala opening of this movie! The pace of the film is deadly slow and,  contrary to other reviews I've seen, I just don't see any chemistry  whatsoever between Hugh and Julia. They looked like they'd be more  comfortable discussing the size of their cut of the movie's gross than  playing love scenes. Compare their scenes with those of Hugh and Andie  Macdowell in Four Weddings and you'll see what I mean. The supporting cast  of fine actors is reduced to stupid, self-pitying cameo scenes, except for  Rhys Infans. Just not much of a movie, romantic or otherwise. Only gets two  stars from me for the all-around level of competence of most of the cast.",2.0
"Julia Roberts character to me was so unsympathetic that I didn't feel that she deserved to be with such a nice guy as Hugh's character is in this film and I was personally hoping that Hugh would stick to his guns and not go  crawling back to her because the way she treated him was not very  nice.
My girlfriend thought that Hugh's flatmate was funny.  I found him  to be ignorant and boorish in the extreme.

"No, I wasn't foolish enough to buy this movie.  It was on ""free"" TV, and I forgot to change the channel.  So in the backgound I had to endure this stuff.

I always wonder:  Didn't writers or directors ever go to high school?  'Cause if they had, they would know that all of these movies - well, at least most of them - are so fake and unlikely that those writers and directors would cringe themselves if they knew the truth.  Let's see; what's the template for these movies?. . . .

Geek dude meets hot chick; hot chick warms up to geek dude; a contrived scenario ensues allowing hot chick to realize geek dude is actually a good guy; geek dude ends up with hot chick.  OK; so maybe the dude doesn't always end up with the hot chick, but he has a chance.  (And no.  This is not a spoiler because you've seen this film before a thousand times, even if you haven't seen it even once.)

And why do people like films such as these?  Well, I don't like them, but some people must because they keep getting made.  But I have a theory:  guys want to at least dream that they can trade up to a babe; and women want to feel better about themselves - precariously through the female lead - feeling as if they actually have a heart, and actually are willing to look past weaknesses that guys have, and might be willing to go out with them.  In real life, they might even marry them!  Yeah.  Happens all the time.  Not.

Phooey.  Should we go one star here?",2.0
"I only give this movie 2 stars because of Hayden Panettiere was in the movie. Otherwise, this is a 1 star movie.

This movie isn't as good I thought it would be. It had a good story line, but the movie just wasn't done well. There wasn't any memorable moments that I could remember. The jokes were kind of dull. The movie was kind of boring. The main stars just seemed to get there way too easy. Then, at the end they end of together and that is that.

No one should ever buy this movie, and this one is a rental at best.",2.0
"""I Love You Beth Cooper"" is a comedy film starring ""Heroes"" ingenue Hayden Panettiere in the title role. The film's pitch may have sounded great on paper-- Nerdy high school senior Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) declares his years-long crush on popular cheerleader Beth on their graduation day, invites her to a party that no one is really coming to, only to have her show up, and all sorts of wacky misadventures ensue.

Indeed, it apparently sounded good on paper since the screenplay was adapted by the novel's author Larry Doyle. That being the case, the excuse of having an unsympathetic interpreter doesn't apply here. The characters are, of course, stereotypes, but for the most part they're not particularly entertaining stereotypes: Denis, despite his temporary boldness in his valedictorian speech, comes across as relentlessly wimpy for the entire rest of the film; the same goes for his best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter), a film-quoting geek who can't help but give the IMDB-rundown on every line he clips from a film character; it's not until the end when this character finally gets some backbone..

As the title character, Panettiere's Beth Cooper is the typical vapid and so-popular-i'm-really-depressed Dream Girl that populates these kinds of movies. An aside about a deceased sibling is vaguely touching but it comes far too late to justify why Denis would pine so long for someone who quite literally didn't know he existed until that day. Ms. Panettiere is as cute as a button, but she really isn't given much to do here. Beth's best-pals are even less-developed. Beth's rageaholic (and apparently drug addict!) boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts) slightly resembles a young Bill Paxton. Alan Ruck, an alumnus of the conceptually similar ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" plays Denis' wants-to-be-cool dad (champagne is made available for Denis' party), though it's surprising that no lines from ""Bueller"" were clipped here for comic effect.

before the end of the film, entire houses are casually destroyed, reckless drivers menace the road, and nary a police officer is called, apparently.

"Just another teenage graduation night film?  Or something much better?

""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" was a film that debuted back in the Summer of 2009 and is based on a 2007 novel by writer Larry Doyle (""The Simpsons"", ""Beavis and Butthead"").  With a screenplay adaptation from the novel by Doyle, the film would be directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", the first two ""Home Alone"" and ""Harry Potter"" films), music composed by Christophe Beck (""The Pink Panther 2"", ""We Are Marshall"", ""Elektra"") and cinematography by Phil Abraham (""Mad Men"", ""The Sopranos"").

Larry Doyle has mentioned that his inspiration for the story was films like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" and his take on graduation night and the adventures of five teenagers.

The film revolves around Denis Cooverman (played by Paul Rust, ""Semi-Pro"", ""Inglourious Basterds""), a valedictorian at his high school who is planning to go to college at Stanford University.  A smart student, he has his life going for him.  But if there was one thing that he regrets, it's the fact that he has always had a crush on Beth Cooper.

He hangs out with his best friend Rich Munsch (played by Jack Carpenter, ""The Return of Jezebel James"", ""The Journal"") who gives him a pep talk that because it's graduation day, if he has things to get off his chest, let it out with no regrets.  Tell Beth Cooper how he feels and  for Denis, this stays in his head but instead of telling her face-to-face, he figured why not tell her on graduation day during his valedictorian speech.

As he gives his speech and talks about living life with no regrets, in front of everyone at the graduation, he tells the popular cheerleader Beth Cooper (played by Hayden Panettiere, ""Heroes"", ""Shanghai Kiss"", ""Malcolm in the Middle"") that he loves her and how he has always loved her.  But somehow along the way, his speech starts to go downhill as he takes a swipe on fellow students such as his his best friend, Rich (who he tries to give a hint that its time to come out of the closet), a swipe at the school bully that has tormented him throughout their school years,  a hint to the girls who has an eating disorder, a swipe that men shouldn't be dating high school students (a dig at Beth Cooper's boyfriend Kevin, who is played by Shawn Roberts) and a dig on a popular but yet shallow student.  Of course, no names are being said but high school students start to judge who may be the person Denis is referring to and thus changes the jovial graduation to a graduation full of discomfort and confusion.  Needless to say, students who think Denis was talking about them, give him the stare of death after the graduation day.

Denis doesn't realize the severity of what he has done but for Beth Cooper, she was very much appreciative of what he had to say, although her military boyfriend Kevin is not and really wants to beat Denis up.

Fortunately, this causes problems between Beth and Kevin and sure enough, Denis is able to get her to possibly come to party he is hosting at his house.

Since Denis and Rich are not exactly popular students and very much are nerds, his parents (played by Alan Ruck and Cynthia Stevenson) leave the house for some R&R and hope their son has a great party. Of course, during a man-to-man talk with Denis and his father, his father tells him and Rich that if needed, there are condoms in the drawer of his bedroom.  Of course, Denis is happy his dad is giving his blessing to get lucky tonight while Rich wonders if the condoms are meant to be used on each other (furthering Denis's feelings that his friend is gay).

So, while the two wonder if anyone is going to come to their party, Beth Cooper and her two popular cheerleading friends Cammy Alcott (played by Lauren London, ""90210') and the bubbly yet not-so-smart Treece (played by Lauren Storm, ""Flight 29 Down"", ""The Game Plan"") come to the party.  With no one else coming, both Denis and Rich try to entertain the ladies but meanwhile, Beth tries to make her ex-boyfriend Kevin jealous by telling him that she's spending her time with Denis.

Next thing you know, Beth's ex-boyfriend Kevin and two of his military friends go to Denis's home and so livid that his girlfriend is spending time at Denis's house, they start trashing the place, while Kevin's mission  is to literally beat up on him.

Denis tries to fight and defend himself and of course, it leads to nothing and thus both he and Rich end up escaping the house through the window and falling to the ground.  After sustaining some injuries, the two manage to join Beth Cooper and friends on an adventurous graduation night which leads them to bare Beth's bad driving,  buying beer at a convenience store, going to a farm  to tip cows, going to a graduation night party where a lot of the high school kids are at and avoiding destruction on the roadway while trying to have a good graduation night and for the most part, to be out of the way of Kevin and his friends.

But through the night, Denis who feels that he knows everything about Beth Cooper starts to see a side of her that he has never seen before.  A good side but also a bad side.

Will Denis survive the night and will Beth Cooper get to know the real him?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (AVC@33MBPS).  For the most part, picture quality is pretty good as the film is featured in the sunlight.  But the film pretty much takes place during the night.  During the day, colors are vibrant, during the evening the blacks are nice and deep and I saw no visual artifacts or banding.

For the most part, the film looks very good.  But to tell you the truth, I didn't notice too many details that stood out.  The truth is that there are not exactly a lot of memorable scenes as most of the action takes place inside Denis's home or inside Beth's car.  Seeing the scabs or blood all over Denis's face is something I wasn't really trying to look for detail but if there was one scene that stood out, it was a breathtaking scene overlooking the lake and mountains near the end of the film.  Picture quality is good for the film on HD.

As for the audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also in Spanish, Portuguese and French 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily a dialogue and music driven film and are front and center channel driven.  There are some scenes that utilize the surrounds such as crowds heard or the various crashing of cars or during the more action-based scenes.  Probably one scene where you get the most action is when Beth Cooper literally crashes to a home where party is being held. But for the most part, the film is literally more about the dialogue and the music and the lossless audio definitely showcases the modern music of this film.

Subtitles are featured in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and Cantonese.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" was like a mashup of my favorite teen/young adult films that I have enjoyed in the past and present.  A little bit of ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Say Anything"", ""American Pie"", ""Superbad"", ""Go"", ""Nick and Norah's Playlist"" to name a few.  With each of those films, there is a sort of redemption with the characters or some type of happy ending.  I suppose you can say that with this film, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"", it's more like a one night stand that really doesn't go anywhere after that.  I couldn't help but feel that perhaps there were major differences between the novel and the film version.

As for the main characters, it's not that they are unlikeable but Denis and Rich are your stereotypical nerds and with this storyline, you sort of think that this film would predictable in that the nerd gets the hot girl at the end or meets some success, whether redemption against the bully or possibly even getting a new girlfriend.

If anything, for most teen films or similar style of films, the main nerd characters always gets the better end of the deal at the end of the film but in this case, I felt that redemption was given to the Denis's best friend Rich (who is just a supporting character) and he gets to have all the fun at the end and somehow, that just didn't seem right to me.  Somehow the main character, Denis Cooverman gets lots in the shuffle and by watching this film, you can't help but feel sorry for him.  He literally becomes the human punching bag and you wish for that ""3:00 High"" moment of redemption of where he would defend himself.  It's important to note that there is an alternate ending included on the Blu-ray via the special features where Denis does get that redemption but unfortunately, the final cut chose not to go that direction.

""I Love You, Beth Cooper""  is not a bad film nor is it a spectacular teen film.  But  I'll admit, I did enjoy it.  I enjoyed the nightly adventures by the five characters (granted, it helps if you had a wild experience during your graduation night) and the crazy adventures they endured throughout the day and night.  There are some comedic moments courtesy of the character of Rich and Treece.

And fortunately there are some shining moments with Paul Rust as the main character of Denis.  If anything, he is a good hearted guy.  Nerdy..but a good-hearted guy who is not all that good with talking to girls. Rust captures that feel of the character and that awkward nerdiness.  Hayden Panettiere is very good at playing the popular cheerleader who likes to have fun and party but also likes to have some danger in her life (sounds similar to her ""Heroes"" counterpart but really, it's not).  And it was great to see Alan Ruck as Denis's father in the film, 23-years later after taking part in his own successful, teen adventure film as the best friend in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".

But it's that one scene that was changed in the film from the novel (the convenience store scene) between Denis and Beth Cooper that was so important but in order to not get the R rating and keep it at PG-13,  I felt would have really made sense to the audience of why Rust's character starts to see things differently with Beth Cooper.  In my opinion, that was one scene critical to the novel that brings a turning point to the storyline.  So, it's unfortunate that version of that one scene was not used.

Overall, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is an entertaining teenage graduation night film but nowhere near being classic.

At the end of the day, you can see how Chris Columbus and even Larry Doyle tried to bring that John Hughes style to the film.  But Hughes was a master in character development and knew how to take those characters to the craziest and more touching moments of the film.  We see the adventure, we just don't feel captivated by the characters.  Again, the film has its share of fun moments but it's the final payoff that you expect from these type of films is what is lacking from ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"".  In the end, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is a fun popcorn flick but nothing more than that.",2.0
"What, I ask you, would be accomplished by humiliating your high school classmates during a graduation speech? And I mean other than making everyone hate you. In ""I Love You, Beth Cooper,"" valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) uses his final speech as an opportunity to say what he has been longing to say ever since his freshman days, none more important the five words that make up the film's title. Other than her, he mentions no one else by name; he only alludes to specific people by describing obvious character traits. You can be sure that everyone knew who he was referring to, and that brings me back to the question I posed at the start of this review. When you use your graduation as a platform to put other people down, you should not be surprised when they get very angry at you.

""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" opens on a wrong premise. The entire film is wrong. On every level imaginable. It's not funny. It's not cute. It's not even remotely engaging or clever in its approach to the story. It's a brainless, mean-spirited film that treats comedy like a second-class citizen. It's appalling that it was directed by Chris Columbus, who once proved he could be entertaining with such fun fare as ""Home Alone,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" ""Rent,"" and the first two ""Harry Potter"" films. For ""I Love You, Beth Cooper,"" the Directors Guild of America should have done him a favor and resurrected that old standby Alan Smithee, a pseudonym for directors who didn't want their real names attached their films.

Having been embarrassed in front of the whole graduating class, Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) and her dimwitted friends decide it would be funny to go to Denis' house, where he and his friend, Rich Munsch (Jack T. Carpenter), host a pathetic post-graduate party that absolutely no one wants to go to. Does Beth like Denis? Not really. But she does find him amusing. Her boyfriend, a testosterone-pumping, cocaine-sniffing military brute named Kevin (Shawn Roberts), does not find him amusing at all. In fact, he would like nothing more than to slowly and painfully kill Denis, preferably when it also involves the destruction of private property. Hoping to escape Kevin, Beth takes Denis and Rich on an all-night road trip in her mini hatchback. Maybe ""road trip"" isn't the right term--Beth has the driving skills of a chimpanzee.

Along the way, Beth and Denis begin the process of getting to know one another. More accurately, Denis tries to survive Beth while she stands back and watches him continually make a fool of himself. I guess we're supposed to sympathize with her somewhere along the way, seeing as she gradually reveals her emotional side, calloused over after years of being used by other boys. Did Columbus and screenwriter Larry Doyle (who adapted his own novel) actually believe that this movie could make us care about her situation? When you willingly include a scene in which tampons are used to stop a nosebleed, you can't believably pause to make a meaningful statement. You definitely can't hint at the possibility of a sweet teenage romance.

Most importantly, you can't begin a story with an act of stupidity and then expect the audience to blindly accept everything that happens afterwards. In all honesty, part of me sided with Denis' classmates--God knows I'd be mad as hell if I was outed in front of everyone. There's absolutely nothing to be gained by pointing out someone's eating disorder, exposing the emotional turmoil raging within the school bully, or encouraging your best friend to come out of the closet. I'm referring to Rich, who constantly quotes from movies and has the uncanny ability to name the actor who said it, the movie it was said in, and the year the movie was released. If there's one thing most people can't stand, it's when someone goes through life as an unwanted human encyclopedia.

I can already see the comments this review will get. ""God Chris, it's a comedy. It was never meant to win awards. Not everything has to be an art house movie. Get a life."" True, I'm being hard on this film. True, I believe it's a shallow and juvenile story that will never win an award (except, maybe, for a Razzie). True, an art house movie in all likelihood would have been an infinitely better choice. But you know what? There is such a thing a good escapist comedy. I gave passing grades to both ""Balls of Fury"" and ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" two films that most critics dismissed as cinematic garbage. I felt they had ambition. ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" most definitely did not. It only wanted to be a mindless farce about idiotic people. Denis, who clearly doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut, is the most idiotic person of all. Then again, maybe that distinction belongs to Columbus, who seems to have forgotten what a movie needs in order to work. Let's hope he gets his memory back.",2.0
"This movie is without blood and without the satirical bite that I had hoped for. A number of good ideas are introduced, but none developed, most salient of which is the character portrayed by Sean Connery. There is way, way too little of him in this movie and way, way too much of John Lithgow's ultra-lame British Accent. The protagonist is a dud too. I was hoping for something on the order of Evelyn Waugh, or at least White Mischief. Instead I got something about as adroit as a Meryl Streep stand-up. This movie just sort of lays there for a while (too long a while) and then just dies.",2.0

"Jim Carrey stars as Andy Kaufman in this woefully dreadful movie. Carrey does capture the essence of Andy Kaufman, but this is the only redeeming feature of this ponderously long and distressing  movie.  As this film so dutifully conveys, Kaufman was a true enigma.  His greatest pleasure in life it seems was putting people on - playing jokes on them and then laughing about how clever he was.  Self-absorbed? - perhaps.  Insecure? - Maybe.  Narcissistic? - Who knows?  Unfortunately, one really does not learn anything substantive about Andy Kaufman the person by watching the story of his life.  Remarkable really - not one ""real"" moment where we see the inner soul of andy Kaufman.  I actually learned more about his life by reading a Wikipedia article about him, and from that single article, I found many factual discrepancies in the film. Perhaps Andy Kaufman never wanted people to know him, so he invented his strange characters to hide behind.  Again, Kaufman is a mystery wrapped up in a secret, wrapped up in a charade, and this movie does nothing to pull away the veneer.  As a fan of Andy Kaufman, I was greatly disappointed in this production.

This movie deserves a 1-star rating if not for Jim Carrey's portrayal of Kaufman.  Carrey nails Kaufman to every twitch and mannerism, but it is not enough to rescue this pathetic film.  My advice is this - ""Don't waste your time!"".

I thought this would be centered more around Andy Kaufman's experiences in Taxi. I wasn't expecting a somewhat boring role to role that he potrayed,2.0
"As a lifelong fan of Andy Kaufman, as well as the bizarre circus known as pro wrestling, I remember being very happy to hear about the then-upcoming biopic, 'Man on the moon'. When I heard it was directed by Milos Forman, creator of 3 of my favorite films ('One flew over the cuckoo's nest', 'Amadeus', and 'The people vs Larry Flynt'), I started chomping at the bit. I saw an early clip of Jim Carrey's astounding imitation of Kaufman, and at that point was prepared to give it early entry into my 'Top 40 films ever' list, without even seeing it! This, to me, appeared to be the definiton of a 'can't miss' movie.
  Sadly, I was way off. Just as Forman and, in the end, Carrey himself were in the making of this huge disappointment. In the 3 Forman films I listed above, as well as 'Ragtime', another critically lauded picture of his, the last description i ever expected to attach to the Acadamy Award winning director's output would be ""by the numbers"". But that's exactly what this formulaic, phony feeling effort is.
  Besides numerous gaffes, which is unforgivable in as bland and distant as this film feels, the movie does the one thing Kaufman himself NEVER did-become predictable. In the end, the only memorable thing about the entire project is Carrey's impression of Kaufman, which is a sad statement indeed. Andy deserved better.",2.0
"It was too bizarre for me, Jim is a Good actor and He did a good portrayal of Mr. Kaufman but I didn't think much of the movie nor Am I obviously a fan of the person. Others should see the movie and decide for themselves.",2.0
"""Man on the Moon"" is, as you undoubtedly already know, a film biopic of the late comedian/entertainer Andy Kaufman, with the irrepressible Jim Carrey in the starring role.  The film for the most part covers Kaufman's public life with sparing glimpses of the decisions and maneuvering that went on behind it; thus we are treated to his early routines on the stages of comedy clubs, his stint as a regular on the sitcom ""Taxi,"" his performance of the fictional lounge singer Tony Clifton, his foray into professional wrestling, first as the ""Intergender Wrestling Champion,"" then as the gadfly for the more conventional male wrestling star Jerry Lawler.
Anyone looking to relive the truly odd, off-center entertainment that Kaufman provided, however, would be much better off finding a compilation of his best filmed performances.  Too often, this movie degenerates into just that, reaching its low point with a montage of scenes from ""Taxi"" that could have easily been lifted from a typical sitcom retrospective.  Anyone who is surprised by the ""revelation"" that Kaufman and Lawler were actors, and their rivalry a calculated fiction, or by any of the other behind-the-scenes portions of the film, is at the very least guilty of not paying attention during Kaufman's lifetime.  Given that this film provides no additional insight into Kaufman's life or personality, its value as biopic is questionable.
Perhaps the biggest problem with the film, surprisingly enough, is Jim Carrey.  He inhabits the role as well as can be expected, but in the end he brings out more of the dark side of Kaufman's career than of a balanced portrait.  Kaufman's act was essentially one of ""I'm smarter than the audience""; his basic premise was to trick the audience into reacting as he wanted them to, and he rarely intended to entertain anyone other than himself.  For all of that, his physical aspect--most notably a round, cherubish face--projected just enough guileless innocence that he was able to carry it off more often than not.  Carrey, on the other hand, for all of the work that must have gone into perfecting his imitation, has a sharply angular face that always appears devious.  He is more at home in the persona of the endlessly obnoxious Tony Clifton than the ""who, me?"" Kaufman, and as a result I'm not sure how someone who never saw Kaufman in the first place would ever understand how such a man could make a career with such an approach.
Other quibbles are more minor:  the casting of several celebrities as themselves, despite the passage of nearly two decades between the events depicted and their re-enactment for this film; the intermittent descent into hagiography (Kaufman's soon-to-be manager:  ""You're insane...but you might also be brilliant."")  Regardless, I found more to dislike in this movie than to like, and found myself bored with it less than halfway through.  I cannot recommend it.",2.0
"The reviewer ""Heather from California"" is most likely working  for the publicity department at Universal Studios.  She gives a raving  review to a very bad movie about Andy Kaufman.

I loved Andy Kaufman's brand of humor and I still feel  the world misses him.  This movie, even with the amazing Paul Giamati,  could not bring Andy to life any more than a shot of adrenaline could for  his corpse.  Carrey gave a nice, if not completely flat performance.

"Review of How to Make an American Quilt
Hot Toasty Rag, July 25, 2017

Ill save you some time. Gents, feel free to skip this movie. Based off the Whitney Otto novel, How to Make an American Quilt shows the audience a confused woman and the journey she takes to find herself as she talks to the women in her knitting group. If you like those kinds of girl power movies like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood or Fried Green Tomatoes, youll definitely want to watch this one.

I don't happen to like those kinds of movies, so despite the large castWinona Ryder, Afre Woodard, Jean Simmons, Anne Bancroft, Ellen Burstyn, Maya Angelou, and Kate NelliganI didn't like this movie. Many women will find this movie touching and heartwarming, but it did nothing for me. The overriding theme is that every woman is a patchwork product of the other women in her life, so when we choose our path of love, its not really because were choosing it; its because all the other womens experiences in love have taught us and shaped us. Ive never been a huge fan of estrogen-fest films, but if you like them, rent this one with your girlfriends.",2.0
"Personally, I was disappointed in this film, since I was hoping to see something more on the lines of Little Women (also starring Winona Rider and Claire Danes).

"forces of nature is a movie that just isn't very good.  The plot seems ok at first but as the movie progresses it doesn't really build up to an anticipated climax.  The relationship between Bullock and Affleck is forced  and does not come naturally.  It seems as if there is not much passion or  forbidden love between the two the way the movie builds it up to be.  I  think Affleck made the right choice at the end though, because the girl he  chose was prettier and seemed like she would be more stable and faithful to  her man.",2.0
"this movie is a triumph of cliche: the plot is one you've seen so many times before that you can't believe anyone would flog it one more time(a road/buddie movie where the leads are of opposite temperament and gender,  and end up (surprise! ) entangled). the characters are similarly  stereotyped: the blonde-next-door sweetheart, the befuddled, bewildered,  stodgy male, the whore with the heart of gold who sets him free (to return  to his sweetheart as a wiser and deeper man). the dialogue,the  situations,the plot twists, are all so predictably stale that you're not  sure if you've wandered into some three-digit channel at 3am. the basic  fallacy behind this movie is the ""what do you do with a dead  horse?"" answer: ""pump him up with air and he'll float.""",2.0
"This is the kind of movie that you see, and after you've seen it, realize you ought to have read the book instead. The characters were just too much for the director (or screenwriters) to handle.
This is the story of a young woman named Finn (Ryder), who is feeling overwhelmed by her university studies and commitment-ready boyfriend. To get away from it all, she spends the summer with her grandmother and aunt in a very small California town. Her grandmother, aunt and their quilting circle get together to make Finn's wedding quilt, and share stories of their past (and current) loves.
Some of the acting is quite good (e.g. Rowlands and Bancroft). Ryder is too languid to convey any real sense of suffering or anxiety. The women's stories are interesting, but lack depth. On the positive side, there is the nice use of flashbacks into different times and places; and I think this movie is just as much about how men relate to women as it is about women trying to deal with their men.
But overall, I was disappointed with the film. It is rather like a few intriguing patches being sewn into a pretty, but unimaginative quilt.",2.0

"Not about love at all.  The character of Sara needed a likeable actress like Sandra Bullock.  Sara was a hot, unholy mess and if it weren't for her good looks and Ben's character, Ben, being so moronic there'd  be no story.  Any normal man who hadn't grown up in a bomb shelter for 28 years would have met plenty of women like Sara long before now and not been impressed.  He'd have learned that fun and crazy can loose you money, sanity and get even the nicest guy locked-up in jail for almost choking a crazy b-out.  SPOILER ALERT****A twice married, once divorced chick whose kid at the age of 6 left HER to stay with the dad is telling.  I did like how the movie didn't hide the results of her disastrous behavior, but the way it interjected her exuberant nature to almost dismiss the horrible consequences of her actions was forced. What every undiagnosed mental problems Sara had they were nothing to be ignored.  The puppy dog love of Ben's character and his final choice to marry his fianc&eacute;e was peculiar. This wasn't even about soon to be married guy getting cold feet. If you have cold feet you run off with an unencumbered hippy chick in her early 20s or maybe even the stripper at your bachelor party (if you're feeling particularly nasty and your pockets are deep...strippers cost money...they don't love you..sorry to break the news.)  Sara had  MAJOR baggage and was old enough to be weighed down by it, shifting her into quick depression.  The writer(s) of this movie must have just gotten a divorce for the 3rd time, because he  hates love, marriage, and couples in general.  I don't know what the reviews were when it came out, but this movie is friggen depressing .  Ben and his so-called true love declaration  to his fianc&eacute;e is disingenuous... almost tacked on by the cynical writer just to please the initial testing audience.  I kind of hated this movie. You can feel a sneering creepiness, hatred,  and condescension for the viewing audience who actually came to see a romantic comedy from the writer(s) who delivered a cess pool of cynicism. I forgot to mention terrible blue lighting to add fantasy or magical or ( I don't know the @@#4) what to this movie.  If Ben was so enamored by Sara, what's to keep him from leaving his wife if she comes back into his life again when his marriage gets boring or stressful?  Nothing.  French Kiss is a better movie about a putz  getting cold fee and drops his long term fianc&eacute;e for a new hot chick--at least the fianc&eacute;e wakes up to the recognize the kind of idiot she almost married...and it's actually a funny movie.",2.0

If you want a great Sandra Bullock film then check out 28 Days or Practical Magic, leave this one on the shelf.",2.0
"Do you remember when that woman in tie dye puts up her left leg in that one tide commercial??? That's EXACTLY what this whole movie is like.  Sandra Bullock, as usual, put up a very strong performance, but Ben Affleck (who in this movie was KINDA HEAVY AND NOT TOO SWEET) was a weak point.  But anyway, back to the Tide analogy.  So in the commercial, the woman gives a little scream, sways back and forth, looks like she's going to be sick, and then instead pulls a rabbit out of the dryer.  Just like this movie because it's not that good until the end, and then JUST LIKE A MAGIC TRICK it all works out in the end.  Still overall, I would call this a weak movie that should best be avoided.... unless you use tide and love rabbits like ME!!!!!",2.0
"I disagree with virtually all of the reviewers about this film.  It was touted as a comedy and ""outrageously funny"".  Well it wasn't overly funny and it made a real effort to be funny but the ""funny"" scenes were so obviously forced and so obviously dumb that they just came across as stupid. Finding a rental car is not that difficult and that is the basis for this movie. I can't believe that anyone is as stupid as these people were supposed to be. Bullock is supposed to be a free spirit but she comes across as immature, undisciplined, and self absorbed.  This was a total waste of talent and Affleck and Bullock did their best but why people of their abilities agreed to appear in this film is a mystery.  I think what put me off of this film is it's totally unrealistic view of marriage.  Of course these are all Hollywood types where any marriage lasting longer than a month is viewed as unusual.  This film would have you believe that every marriage is at its core -- unhappy and that most people are divorced or adulterers. Men and women are unhappy with their partners and anyone who gets married should expect to be unhappy -- that is the message here, but it is also how most Hollywood types view marriage. Beyond that we have the usual Hollywood view that EVERYONE smokes Marijuana or takes drugs of some sort -- EVERYBODY DOES.  Well I don't think so and I thought this film was simply not funny and I don't see anything humorous about being arrested for drugs.  At no level was this film realistic and none of the actions were logical or believable (imagine holding an outside wedding even though hurricane flags are flying -- is anyone really that stupid?)  I gave this film 2 stars only because I watched it to the end -- why I have no idea because it wasn't worth it.",2.0
"If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell.

Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning.

Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle?

The acting in this movie is ""meh"", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part.

The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you.

You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable.",2.0
"There's nothing really more irritating than sitting down to a movie that you think is going to be good and ends up falling flat on its face. ""Forces of Nature,"" while trying to be funny and cheerful, succeeds only in achieving this goal, and, I must say, very admirably. Promoted as a bright and sassy comedy about a guy trying desperately to get to his wedding, it ends up being more, so much more, in fact, that it bogs the film down in a blithering mess of subplot and washed up one-liners which carry on for too long.
The husband in question is Ben Holmes, who hates bachelor parties and can't wait to get hitched with his soulmate sweetheart. Of course, they both live in New York, and since the story needs a great deal of distance to separate our two love birds for a long period of time, the wedding is going to take place in Savannah, where her parents are planning a very festive celebration. Ben's parents want to marry him off for some reason not discussed in the plot. She flies down before him (why not together?), and he soon boards his own plane which has an accident on the runway, leaving him and his seating partner Sarah stranded. Sarah is a bit wild and evasive, without a care in the world it seems, though her admissions will later prove otherwise. Thus begins the wild race down to Savannah, involving natural and human disasters which stand in his way, not to mention his undeniable attraction to the illustrious Sarah.
The story seems like it has a lot going for it. So why does it fail in so many places during the movie? Well, there's a lot of things wrong with it: the contrivance of the plot, the bad execution of most of the key scenes, the let-down ending, and most of all, the character of Ben.
Throughout the entire movie, our two little nomads run into one problem after another, from things like stalled planes to switched train cars, from stormy weather to geriatrics on a travel bus who believe the lie about Ben being a doctor, Ben and Sarah run into just about anything you can possibly think of. While this may sound amusing, it gets to the point where you keep wishing he'd do one of two things: call his parents and get their credit card number to purchase a ticket to Savannah, or screw Sarah like he knows he wants to, call his fiancee and break the wedding off, and run away into the sunset and never be seen again.
The way some of the scenes in this film were carried out, as well as their content, are too contrived and unbelievable to make the movie work. one of these scenes that especially stands out is the trip they take to K-Mart to get out of a rainstorm. Here, they are seen romping through the store, using walkie-talkies to communicate while shopping, sitting in beach lounge chairs having drinks and talking like they own the chain of stores. I'm not sure how they usually operate things at K-Mart, but in my town, they'd be kicked out by management. The ending is the biggest contrivance, and since I cannot give it away, let's just say that there's no way you can have a wedding like that.
The characters of the film turn out to be a major disappointment, especially when they are given the opportunity to shine. Ben, portrayed by Ben Affleck, is portrayed as nothing more than a mushy, whining idiot who you wish would trip and break his face at least ten times throughout the movie. While his inner struggle is supposed to provide a dramatic factor for the movie, it does nothing more than make him and the story more annoying and unbearable. Sandra Bullock, while charming and radiant, proves that her character is a big fat waste of talent. Her free-spiritedness and wit grow even more tired than Affleck's whining, though she does have her monents of hilarity. The saddest waste of actress is Maura Tierney, who plays Ben's fiancee. During her stay in Savannah, awaiting the arrival of Ben, all she can do is pout about his inability to reach her sooner, get drunk with friends, be seduced without success by an old high school male friend, and listen to her parents gripe and complain about her fiancee's tardiness.
One an even worse note, I must comment on the decision to try and have a parental storyline going on in the midst of everything else (as if there weren't enough to keep up with already). Tierney's parents turn out to be separated, while Affleck's are happily married. They keep popping up just when you think they've been obliterated by the scriptwriter who was deciding to give us a blessing.
My summation: too much plot going on, hardly a shred of believability, even if you suspend disbelief, and less-than-amusing characters, all combined into one large mess that makes ""Forces of Nature"" a very confused and sloppy attempt at a romantic comedy. To thou who wouldst see this movie, I charge thee beware endless subplots and annoyances that make your own life's discord seem like posies in a breezy field.",2.0
"Affleck and Bullock play mismatched travelers to Savannah, Georgia; he, to his wedding, and she, well, she has her reasons. The two have zero chemistry together; Steve Martin and John Candy had a lot more in the  similar-themed Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987), which was a lot  funnier as well. Even a scene where Affleck dances in a gay bar, which has  potential for laughs, falls flat. At least Steve Zahn, as Affleck's best  man, is funny. A waste of time and talent.",2.0

"primarily about society's discriminatory issues with homosexuals, but many other social ills were also catalogued.  However, neither those things, nor great production values, does a great movie make.  I thought this when the movie came out and nothing about it has changed for me on this second viewing, almost 20 yrs later.  On top of those things, there is the pedophilia issue of Mena Suvari probably being under age, or at least looking all of 13, and Kevin Spacey, in his 40s, which just made me squirm.  And I am no prude nor am I in any way conservative.  But that was over the top.  No amount of good production values and, at that time, groundbreaking ideas in film, were able to rise above all the titillation in this film  Perhaps it was a device to showcase a proper gay couple against a very dysfunctional traditional marriage, but I think it could have been done without all that, although it may not have gotten the audience it did without Mena Suvari writhing around, or gasp, Annette Benning with her legs in the air, screaming in sexual ecstasy (nothing I wanted to see then, or now).  At its best, it gave Thora Birch a vehicle for a top notch acting job (pretty much the only nuanced performance of the bunch) and highlighted society's failings by using most of the plot of Catcher in the Rye.  But in 1999, the 60s were over and we'd seen it all before, albeit without the blatant underage component.  Skip it and go watch The Graduate, which tells the same story but in a much classier and truly award winning manner in all areas. Or Philadelphia, a much better commentary on how we treat homosexuals in our society.",2.0
"What a crazy piece of work this is. I do not mind remakes so much, but really this is too much. Whole scenes have been copied directly from the original Peckinpah movie and nowhere is there any improvement. On the  contrary! Basinger is not to bad, but I liked Ali McGraw better in the  part. Steve McQueen was a hundred times better than Alec Baldwin, Donaldson  is no Peckinpah and through it all I missed Quincy Jones' excellent score.  The story is practically the same, but without the taut suspence of the  original. Michael Madson and Jennifer Tilly steal the show and while they  do a good job, they are not supposed to carry the movie. Now you start  thinking them the interesting part and the bit about the McCoys running to  Mexico with all gangland USA on their tale becomes an anoying sideline.  Don't bother to watch this one. It is nothing better than any other action  movie. Stick with the original!",2.0
"Probably one of the most depressing movies that I've ever watched!  Not sure why people liked it so much.  Yeah, the themes may touch on the more disturbing side of our nature but there is not one uplifting moment in the entire film..ugh.  Really make you want to take a Prozac after.",2.0
"Thieves/gangsters are involved in a heist involving a Mexican. As the police move in a couple of the American thieves leave the one behind. He goes to prison. He hatches a plan to get himself out of a Mexican jail by sending his wife to another thief/gangster who supposedly is so powerful he can arrange for the guy to get out of the jail. He does. So they start off on a new heist. This time things turn even bloodier. Everyone starts killing each other after the heist. And a chase ensues.

Umm. I have no idea what the appeal is about this movie for anyone. All the characters are horrible people. There are a couple of sex scenes with Bassinger and Baldwin where she is completely naked. Is that it? Who knows what drives people. I was sitting here thinking how odd a real-life couple would do that on film. How a husband would want his wife filmed like that. Sickos. Anyway even those scenes were passionless. There was just no chemistry. Bassinger didn't come off as believable in any of this. Baldwin is his usual so-so actor self. The others are odd.

It is sad though. This could have been one of those go-to movies to frame Baldwin and Bassinger's marriage. Maybe it did. But wouldn't it have been nostalgic and romantic if they had made this great movie together--capturing it on film--before they divorced to make people wish/hope that they would get back together? Oh well.

But if you don't want to take my word for it just know that that weirdo Jennifer Tilly is in this movie. She has such a high creep factor that you know this movie is just bad by her association.",2.0

"The remake of this classic film is O.K.  It certainly doesn't leave you with that lingering sense of having just witnessed one heck of a prize fight like the original movie, which starred the ineffable Steve McQueen.  Without a doubt, the action scenes of this remake are enjoyable and the acting is decent, but what it lacks is a quality you can hardly blame Alec Baldwin for lacking.  It lacks the unflappable, self-composed nuance and aesthetic action appeal that Steve Mcqueen brought to every role he ever encontered.  This is not to say that Alec Baldwin isn't good at the roles he typically takes on, that is, the role of the villian; but when recruited to play the hero, no matter how hard one trys, one just simply does not find himself rooting for Alex Baldwin.  Perhaps this is because Baldwin plays himself, just as Steve McQeeun played himself; but there is no doubt that the measured and controlled hard-guy approach of McQueen is far more compelling as the hero than is the inflated braggadocio and swarthy arrogance of Baldwin.  Nevertheless, even with the bad casting of the lead role, the remake is entertaining.  However, the better choice for your entertainment dollar will always be the original.",2.0

"Don't waste your time on this movie.
There are some good actors here, but they didn't have anything good to work with, and so they did their best.
I love Steven Rea.

SPOILERS..

Annette Benning plays psychic.
She sees little girls get kidnapped, but she gets the psychic clues much too late to save anyone.

She sees clues on the kidnapping of a little girl, and, too late, she realizes that it is actually her own little girl who gets kidnapped and killed.

It is never explained how the little girls are killed, they are just found dead somehow.

It really bothered me that Annette and her husband didn't seem to mourn their own little girl.
They did some screaming when she first was found dead, but that was all.

Annette has visions of her husband and dog getting killed, but again, it is too late, and they are both murdered.
She does not appear to mourn them.  She is too focused on her visions.

She even has visions of her own death, and, at the end, she also dies.

The movie started out really interesting.
I love psychic movies.
But after her own little girl is killed, the movie takes a turn, and it just becomes ridiculous.
The story went out of control, so that the kidnapper was able to read Annette just like she could read him.
The kidnapper leads Annette right to him, where he was holding another little girl hostage.

I didn't find anything scary about this movie.
The movie tried to be scary and tried to make the kidnapper look really sick and twisted and nuts, but it was just too ridiculous.
The psychic images were really good at the beginning, until the story began focusing on apples and water.

It was never explained how and why Annette and the kidnapper could read each other.
It was loosely explained that the kidnapper wanted a family because he was abused and abandoned by his parents, so he kidnaps little girls to be his family, and then kills them, but it is not explained how or exactly why he kills them.

Little girls die.
Annette dies, her little girl dies, her dog dies, her husband dies.
Two men who innocently pick up hitchhikers (first the kidnapper and then Annette) both die.
The last kidnapped girl and the kidnapper survive.
Annette's maid survives, but she was obviously left without a job now that the entire household was murdered.
The psychiatrist and the mental hospital do not seem to get into trouble for not doing their jobs, by letting both the kidnapper and Annette escape and by not protecting them and everyone else.

I thought that it was strange and funny and ridiculous that the kidnapper's name was Vivian, and yes, he was a man.
How can a man be named Vivian?
And why wouldn't he give himself some kind of a nickname with a name like that?

I actually laughed at the end, which was clearly supposed to be sick and scary, but instead, was, again, ridiculous.

The talent of Steven Rea, as the psychiatrist, was wasted.

This was a very surprising film because I really like Annette Benning and Robert Downey, Jr. - normally!

The story was disjointed and the script was predictable but the acting was ""surprising"" at best. Benning was not convincing in her role however she definitely had moments. RDJ was as strange as possible in a role that was scripted one half psycho and one half psycho on steroids. This was one of his early films so that accounts for something I suppose but the script he had to deal with was a huge hinderance for an actor who could have done much more.

Ah, the production - over the top to say it mildly. Any pretense of elegant tension was quickly dissipated by the gore associated with RDJ's actions. I mean, come on folks, having Adian Quinn's face eaten off by a starving dog (his dog I might observe), is reaching to once again, put it mildly. By-the-by, Quinn's role/script was even more off-putting than Benning or RDJ.

"In 1999, there was this guy who went completely off the rails.  He was a squatter, did drugs, and was a nightmare for everyone around him.  It's amazing how art can imitate life.

Well, luckily for us, Robert Downey Jr. turned his life around, while not so much can be said about the character named Vivian that he played in this film.  Vivian is surely a psycho, but the question is, how could any sane real-life actor want to play this character after taking a peek at the screenplay?  Or even want to be involved in such an ill-fated project?

And this goes for Annette Bening, who's done some very nice work over her career.  It even applies to Aidan Quinn, an actor that I believe hasn't quite gotten enough credit over the years.  I think that, while you surely can't bucket him into that ""great"" actor category, he surely is only a notch or so below that.  He was really good in ""Stakeout,"" but I also really liked him in ""Benny and Joon.""  And he's kind of got that ""everyman quality"" that people can relate to, even though most likely most women find him to be attractive.

With regards to this film, the screenplay is absolutely nonsensical.  I was laughing most of the time, which surely is a bad sign.  This was supposed to be either horror, or some psychological thriller, right?  Well, it was horrifying, call it more of a nightmare that never seemed to end.  And it's running time was only 98 minutes, but it sure seemed much longer than that to me.  After I had wasted a half hour or so of my time, I decided to stick it out.  Well, as a smart guy once said to me, ""Don't throw good money after bad.""  Wish I'd listen, even though this was on ""free"" TV.

Thinking about the question, ""Why did the actors even want to be involved in this ill-fated project?"" I did come up with a theory.  It was 1999 and a recession was just on the horizon.  The DotCom bubble was about to burst, and money was going to be tight.  Well, both the Robert Downey Jr. and Annette Bening characters were supposed to be psychic, so maybe they realized in advance that they'd need the work and the money.

In addition to that, the woman who plays lead characters spends WAY too much time screaming her head off and never acting normal even for a *second* so the entire film ended up giving me a headache.

I understand she'd freak out during one scene involving her daughter by a lake, but for the most part, she was extremely hard to deal with thanks entirely to her nonstop screaming.  It was completely out of control to an annoying extent.

Sometimes I just don't get what the writers are going for, and this *extremely* confusing storyline is a perfect example of ""I don't get it"" that I've ever seen.  You just don't know what's going on half the time... no no, make that 25% of the time.  It's all a big bundle of confusion and it never really stops being confusing either.

A shame, because the acting was excellent. If only the composition had matched the effort of the actors",2.0
"Movie: *1/2  DVD Quality: ****  DVD Extras: ***

Don't be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members; ""In Dreams"" is without doubt THE career low for director/screenwriter Neil Jordan as well as actors Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and even Robert Downey, Jr. (who's made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career).  The film aspires to be a psychological mystery-suspense-thriller in the vein of ""Psycho"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but is completely undone by a cut-and-paste script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters; uninspired direction; shallow performances; choppy editing; and a grossly ineffective musical score.  Only one scene in the movie is played convincingly, and that's the one in which Annette Bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally; pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion, Bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie.  Unfortunately, that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other 97 minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile.

In terms of technical quality, the DVD presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable.  Picture quality is clear and sharp; the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots, but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers - I was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that I didn't stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question.  The DVD extras are so-so: thumbnail cast and crew Biographies that mention much better movies; several lackluster screens filled with ""Production Notes""; and finally, the Theatrical Trailer, which is probably the best thing on the disc because it's short and features quick flashes of the film's visual highlights.  ""In Dreams"" is not recommended viewing, even for those viewers who enjoy bad movies for their camp value.",2.0
"'Good on you', Annette. She really puts her all into this movie. Sadly it's not enough. The rest of the cast seem to sleep walk through the entire length of the film.  Hello! Stephen Rea - I swear to God his performance was so wooden, I doubt he even bent at the knees as he crossed the screen. The Cinematography is lovely, especially the underwater town (I'm a diver) but the story really goes awry, the characters show little concern for the plot, and Robert Downey. Jr plays Psycho like Bob Dylan, sans Guitar.  The finale is straight out of a soap opera (did they run out of film, couldn't afford a less hammy performance?) Honestly, if you appreciate good mysteries and a good tale, if you want to be scared and convinced that something terrible is happening, then watch Alley McBeal, it's right up there with 'In Dreams'.",2.0
"What a stinkeroo! What a waste of time, talent, and energy! But if you crave a good horror movie, see ""The Ugly."" Then see ""In Dreams."" Then compare them. Put simply, there's no comparison.

Well, there's a nice  performance from Toby, Annette Bening's dog, who's more convincing than  Robert Downey's villain. Another plus is when the film is over and Roy  Orbison sings ""In Dreams"" over the credits. It's hard to believe  this film was directed by Neil Jordan, the same bloke who did the  undervalued Bob Hoskins' starrer, ""Mona Lisa.""",2.0
"I remembered seeing this movie about 30years ago and enjoying it, so bought the BluRay, assuming that this would be a better experience than the standard DVD. Big disappointment: the colors are rendered extremely artificial, with washed-out blues and tress that look like they have been painted a lurid green.

 The story behind the cinematography explains how so much time and effort was wasted on a few small scenes, and it shows: great set pieces cobbled together with almost ""found footage"" makes for a very uneven scrapbook of a film.

"This review is for as far as this movie getting an academy award and great praise.

Characters personalities don't add up. The supposed 'psycho' son is all sensitive and sentimental, and his father shows genuine concern and care for him despite regularly beating him up hard.
The lead family's daughter plots to have her father killed simply because she isn't proud of him which is a weird motif, and gets her ""psycho"" boyfriend to agree to do it, but wait, it's actually the psycho son's abusive father that pulls the trigger because he thinks he's gay?  So out of the blue they decided the dad should pull the trigger because he's homophobic, meaning two people want to kill a father, one for not being a good father, the other for being 'possibly gay. Talk of weird motives for murder.

A sentimental and sensitive psycho who's also a drug dealer. A suggestive virgin, an emphatic abuser, not sure how a supposedly great movie doesn't even get basic personality traits right,  these make no sense even by comic book standards.

The sentimental psycho neighbor's son ends up rebutting  his fathers attack (as in a 'the final revenge', which seems to confuse the film's message unless it  wants to tell 10 messages at once) and moves out after getting a last severe beating by his father, and does so in the middle of the night, and his mom doesn't even raise an eyebrow but casually 'understands', and out he moves, as if they put no consideration into the magnitude of events, at all.

The homophobic neighbor dad then breaks down to the lead character  dad  whom he later kills because he hates gays even though he'd just came out to him as gay himself, that's a conflict that makes no sense. He has to be either 100% machismo or 100% soft (breaks down, tries to kiss a man), nothing in between? It's as if a baby put together the characters - ""hey, we must show the audience that this guy is a closet gay, so why not have him try and KISS his male neighbor"", duh, not exactly subtle for such a 'crop of the cream' film..

And the lead dad  has to be dead with a bullet hole in his scull before his wife may finally show some minimal affection. Way to evoke 'thought', bluntly.  All these shock scenes are padded with excessively long, mind numbing trips mired in sentimental drivel and music, aka fluff, wherein the 'psycho' son gets exceedingly sentimental, talking about outright love and beauty, turning the film outright pretentious. It's basically a long emotional trip, as are many music videos btw. NOT a great movie, certainly not Oscar worthy by any means.",2.0

"I'd heard a lot of good things about this movie, including the ""Best Picture"" Oscar, but I'd never seen it until recently.  Surprisingly, it was pretty disappointing because of all of the stupid little things that didn't make sense.  When I watch a movie, I am perfectly willing to buy ""the premise,"" and to suspend my disbelief and pretend that I'm watching some actual story, not just a bunch of actors on a set saying lines.  So, when the movie begins, I'm really willing to give it a chance until....until.....the movie gets to some point where I just say to myself ""Yeah, right.""  Which means that whatever just happened has violated ""the premise"" of the story (probably because of the writer's laziness or poor editing), and is making the story unbelievable, unreal, contrived, and frankly, just stupid.  So that was my problem with this movie -- too much stuff in it was just plain STUPID.

So, where to begin?

Well, this movie takes itself so seriously that it actually comes with its own built-in hype, which TELLS you, in kind of an unofficial subtitle, to ""look closer.""  Okay, fine.  So you meet the Burnham family right up front, and within seconds all three of them come off as superficial, shallow, empty, bored and boring people.  Then the movie goes on, and on, and on, and what happens?  These characters have a bunch of little episodes that reveal each of them as -- shallow, empty, and boring people.  That's the result of ""looking closer,"" which is not what you expect.  Because when someone says ""look closer,"" aren't they implying that you will see something deeper and more meaningful and more important than the appearance you see at first glance?  Sure they are.  But here, when you ""look closer"" at these superficial people, YOU SEE EXACTLY THE SAME THING -- SUPERFICIAL PEOPLE, EXCEPT AT A CLOSER RANGE.  So what?

I guess to be fair you might say that Spacey's character finally shows a LITTLE depth at the very end of the movie, and apparently ""grows up"" a little bit when he decides not to sexually molest his daughter's friend (how NICE of him to decide not to commit statutory rape, eh?) but really, there isn't much more to it than that.

But besides the characterization problem, there are just lots of stupid little things that are very distracting, and show a remarkable sloppiness.  Why the other reviewers chose to ignore these things is puzzling to me.

Some examples --

The family's house -- they live in this weird house that is like a reverse Tardis from Dr. Who.  That is, from the inside it's a rather modest two-bedroom house, but from the outside it's a rather large 4-5 bedroom house, at least double the size that the interior shots reveal.  Whaddup widdat?  Another thing about the house is that, from the outside, where it appears huge, it would seem to be way more expensive than the Burnhams could afford, especially since Spacey has some dead-end job where he works from a CUBICLE.  What does that mean?  (Come on, LOOK CLOSER.)  It means he doesn't make much money.  So how can he and his wife afford that $500K mansion?  Yet another weird thing about the house -- it has all these wide-open windows, without blinds or curtains, even in the garage, so that the neighbors can conveniently watch (and film!) things that happen in the house.  Yeah, right -- happens every day.  So, so ""real,"" huh?

Spacey's sexual fixation on his daughter's friend, Angela -- I guess it doesn't bother Spacey that Angela is a minor because she projects a lot of sexuality.  Okay, fine.  But then he fantasizes about her while he's lying in bed, and what's his fantasy?  That she's lying in a bed of rose petals, with various petals strategically placed over her otherwise naked body.  Yeah, right.  As if that's the way he would be imagining her, with stupid rose petals covering her up.  Yeah right, raised to the tenth power.  No man on earth would have that fantasy.  In fact, no man since the beginning of the human species would have that fantasy.  Period.  But the strange thing is, that near the end of the movie, when he is finally about to have sex with her, she actually does expose her breasts, which was totally UN-necessary to the scene or the story.  Purely gratuituous nudity, and thus insulting to the viewer.  But when Angela's nudity WOULD have been perfectly appropriate, in the fantasy sequence, THEN she's covered up.  Makes no sense.

Speaking of nudity, there is also a brief shot of Jane in a topless state, also purely gratuituous, but not only that, the shot shows how extremely well-endowed she is, and yet she is saving up her money to have breast enlargement surgery.  Huh?  After Jane's nude shot, I had to rewind to the beginning because I thought, ""she must actually want a breast reduction, right?""  But no, in the beginning of the movie she is worried about being under-endowed in the breast department -- but by her nude scene, she has the over-developed body of a Vegas stripper.  Didn't anyone read both parts of the script?

Going back to Angela for a minute, at the end of the film Spacey is apparently going to have sex with her right there IN HIS LIVING ROOM, when his daughter and her boyfriend are upstairs and when his wife can walk in at any minute -- yeah, right.  It's not stupid enough that he's going to risk going to jail for rape, we're supposed to believe that if someone walks into the room, he'll just ignore them, right?

There are so many other stupid things like that.  The drug-dealing neighbor kid hides his pot in a drawer with a fake bottom -- as if nobody would EVER think of something so clever to hide stuff, especially his suspicious father.  But on top of this, the kid also keeps small containers of ""clean urine"" in the refrigerator in his room -- NOT HIDDEN AT ALL FROM HIS NOSY FATHER.  Why does he hide the pot, but not the urine?  Yeah, right.  Speaking of the father next door, apparently he is a Shao Lin monk in disguise, and can therefore ""walk through walls,"" because at the end of the film, although he is SOAKING WET from the rain, he's able to walk right into Spacey's kitchen, come right up behind him and shoot his pistol, all with such absolute silence and stealth that Spacey doesn't know that the dripping wet father is standing there, inches behind him.  Yeah, right.

One of my favorite stupid scenes, though, is when Bening comes home and sees Spacey's new classic muscle car, which he just bought because it's something he ""always wanted.""  Then a few minutes later, he is reprimanding Bening for having bought a $4,000 silk couch, telling her that it's just ""a thing,"" and not important, and that his new non-material viewpoint allows him to see this profound truth, etc.  Well, what about the $25,000 that HE just spent on that ""thing"" in the driveway?  What's the big difference?  And then, Spacey gets a ""fun"" and ""carefree"" job at a fast food place after he quits his old job -- as if that kind minimum wage job is anything but pure drudgery and hard work, not ""fun"" at all.  Why isn't he shown mopping the floors and emptying the trash into the stinking dumpster out back?  That's what he'd really be doing in such a ""fun"" job.  And why don't they show him getting his first fast-food-job-paycheck, for less than he used to make in one day at his old job?  I guess he has no worries about his only daughter's possible college plans, eh?  No, nobody with a single teenage child worries about that.  Yeah, right.

How so many reviewers can see this as some kind of ""gutsy"" or even ""artsy"" film is beyond me.  It had some promise, and I actually did like some of the insights that the neighbor drug-dealer kid imparted, but there are just too many ""yeah right"" moments otherwise, from beginning to end, to make this worthwhile.  I guess there were not that many good movies in 1999, relatively speaking, if this one got an award for being ""the best.""",2.0
"I am dismayed to see how beloved this movie is (and mortified that most of the negative reviews focus mainly on the quality of the product, not on the film itself, though that of course is a legitimate thing to complain about).  I give it two stars and not one because it IS a well-made film.  The acting is strong and the director clearly had a vision.

Now the bad news.  I find nothing, NOTHING profound or insightful or moving about this film. As another reviewer pointed out, is it really new news that the pursuit of the so-called American dream is shallow and unfulfilling?  Is it really a revelation that if you took a glimpse inside a seemingly perfect American household you'd find a lot of shocking things?  And the solution -- that we should take time to enjoy life and its little moments of beauty ... really?

[Note: the following contains some spoilers]

Hollywood and the movie-viewing public love movies in which wealthy people are unhappy and can only find happiness by shunning their materialism.  This makes us all feel better:  people who aren't as wealthy as the family portrayed here (which is most of America and most of the movie-watching public) can feel good in knowing that it's OK that they struggle to make ends meet, because, hey, it's better than being rich!  It's the same fake-populist message moviemakers have been throwing at us for decades, and people eat it right up, somehow believing that the family in this movie is ""just like us.""  I doubt that.

What's more, again as another reviewer pointed out, this movie should have been titled ""American White Wealthy Straight Male Fantasy.""  This is one of the most misogynistic movies I've seen in years.  Annette Benning should have won the Oscar just for being a good sport in allowing her character to be portrayed in a spectacularly unflattering way.  The ambitious middle-aged career woman is portrayed as a monster, while her daughter is portrayed as more of a female ideal. Why? She falls in love with the boy next door, whom others think is creepy but of course she sees through that and allows him to watch and film her disrobe.  How good of her to enjoy being objectified.  When they agree to run away, she sweetly offers the small amount of money she's saved up.  He smiles protectively and says that's OK, he's made enough money selling drugs to take care of the both of them.  Enlightened viewers are supposed to go along with this and think it's cool and delightfully subversive that he's a drug dealer, and if you have a problem with that you're too morally upright because who is he harming?  Uh, how about all those people who are killed during drug trafficking?  But that's OK, because it's more important that these uptight, angst-ridden American suburbanites are able to cut loose and get high.

And then there's the dreadful cliche of the ""bad guy"" of the film being a repressed homosexual.  The film wants to show how enlightened and tolerant it is by having a nice gay couple in it and having the Spacey character befriend them.  But including this stereotype subtley suggests that homosexuality is shameful and messes with your head.  I know this was unintentional, but if you're going to make a film that's Oscar-worthy, you can't be that sloppy.

I could go on but have gone on too far already, especially since I know all this will fall on deaf ears.  Make a beautiful-looking movie, cast great actors, and make it seem like you're revealing something profound when you're really just slinging the same tired message that is so comforting to audiences -- badaboom badabing, award-winning success.",2.0

"It's BOTH.  It's a well-scripted, contrived and slick piece of film propaganda that's acted out by talented actors.

I really loath this movie, despite the fact that it is entertaining and won an Oscar.  I loath the fact that it is so manipulative.  I hate the fact that very talented people created a script that has such a depressing and hateful ""moral"" agenda. This movie is very Alinsky-ite to me.  It is cynical to the fifth power, and all its cynicism is directed towards breaking down our repect for the American middle-class nuclear family, as well as other institutions such as free-market businesses and the American military.  American Beauty almost drips with hatred at the white, suburban American family.  Everyone in the movie is selfish and pathetic, except of course, the neighborhood gay couple, who are charming, well-adjusted and happy!  Everything is so contrived and absolutely manipulative.  I can't see why people like it, honestly, unless they just remove their moral sense and totally give in to the movie-makers' agenda.

I loath the fact that the protagonist's (Kevin Spacey) daughter seems to care so little about her father, near the end of the movie (more on that below), and loath even more the depiction of the toxic family that her boyfriend/neighbor has.  I hate the poisonous way that the American Job is depicted: either a cynical place that Spacey's character extorts for severance pay, or a depressing place where his wife chases a big Real Estate score and then has an affair with her boss.  Inexperienced and impressionable people who watch this movie may be dissuaded into working for the private sector, and instead seek out paper-pushing bureaucratic jobs in government, because of the toxic nature in which private business is portrayed.  (And NOW we see that private sector jobs are steadily shrinking -- and do YOU things getting better or worse?)  Young people may watch the poisonous and loveless families in this movie and not want to get married or form families (And NOW we see that nuclear families are steadily shrinking, with a tsunami of single-parent families dependent on the government -- and do YOU think things getting better or worse?)

< Spoilers Below >

The absolute worst part of the movie shows the pot-smoking neighbor boy being browbeaten and physically abused by his over-the-top ex-Colonel father.  The writers then make the Colonel, who warns his son against ""going gay"", out to have secret gay tendencies.  Let me tell you, I guarantee that men who have risen to Colonel in the Army or Marines are quality people and not this kind of pathetic, loveless, dead-end hypocrite depicted here.  I guarantee that the vast majority of families with fathers in the military are good families where their kids love their parents, and their Mom and Dad love each other.  NOT in this propaganda film!  And of course, the adults in the movie are slaves to their sex drives:  Spacey wants to bed his daughter's hot cheerleader friend, his wife has an affair with her boss, and the Colonel wants to act out his homosexual urges.  In the liberal world, sex is our God and we are just helpless pawns to it!

There is one scene that I like in the movie where Spacey becomes an adult, but it's followed by a scene of utter loathsomeness.  The one good scene is where Spacey gets his big chance with his daughter's friend, he discovers that she's a virgin, and then he refuses to go through with her sexual molestation, and instead comforts her.  Then unfortunately, he is shot in the head (by whom I won't say).  After he is shot (in his own house), I hate it that the writers show his own daughter simply looking at him with cold amazement, with less emotion than she would have if a dog got killed.  Absolutely no love for her father is shown. No family bond or warmth.  (VERY unrealistic and loathsome. Think if your father got shot!)  Are American teens so much into themselves that they wouldn't even mourn the murder of their own father??? I don't think so, but the cynical writers of this film think so.  Utter cynicism and poisonous contempt of the basic building block of our society:  the American Nuclear Family.

So in summary, American Beauty is an engaging yet loathsome piece of propaganda, in which its creators slickly pedal the tenents of their destructive, Alinskyite values:  a) the American Family is a loveless sham; b) all adults are slaves of their sex drives; c) the Military, and the values of discipline that the Military believes in, is to be trashed; and d) Free-Market private enterprise is a corrupt institution and likewise to be trashed.",2.0

I have waited a long time to get a worthwhile home video version, but this DVD is not it. For a start they should of released a widescreen version. Even though it was shot in 1:1.66 (not 1:1.33 as someone said) ratio as lots of films are it was obviously not intended to be shown, theatrically at least, in that ratio.

"Five Osars??? This movie got FIVE Oscars? How sad is that? This is the culture we are exporting. This is why they hate us. Okay, I can see that some people like the idea of the poor, put upon patriarch finally standing up to his unappreciative family. Lots of deep, dark, disturbing images - we in America seem to like that sort of thing for some reason. What is it that makes it OK to celebrate old men seducing little girls? Okay, so he doesn't follow through - when she tells him she is actually a virgin. Would it have been okay if she had not been? Does that make it okay that he gets killed? That the only decent relationships the man seems to have is with children? And we're supposed to have COMPASSION for the character?

Kevin Spacey has taken some risks with his career, most of which I have great respect for. I have to say this one makes no sense. Sexy naked teenaged girls and images of Annette Bening with her legs in the air may make a lot of money, but there's plenty of that on the Internet.

The violence, the homophobia juxtaposed with homosexual imagery that only contributes to the phoniness of what passes for ""family values"" - perhaps it is the hypocrisy above all that so many could relate to.

I'm glad I saw this movie just so I can say I saw it, given that it seems to be such a cultural icon. Now I can discuss it if I have to. But it's a sad day when a movie likes this says something this important about who we are as a culture. A sad day indeed.",2.0

The very last scene of AB is the true tip-off to the reality of the rip-off, compare the camera's heavenwards pullback and Spacey's final voiceover monologue. The lovely poetry of BLISS' last scene will, if you have even a vague pulse, bring real soul-tears to your eyes. You tell me.

"Beauty"" begins with Lester Burnham (Spacey), so beaten down by lifeless routine, that he has lost even the ability to feel pain or anything.  Lester's harpy of a wife Carolyn (Benning), a status-hungry real-estate velociraptor is only capable of dishing out bile.  Between the two suffers Jane, their self-loathing daughter (Thora Birch from ""Ghost World).  We also meet those who surround them, a gay couple; a retired homophobic marine; his catatonic wife, their seemingly psychotic, voyeuristic and pot-selling son Ricky, and Jane's obviously psychotically vain friend Angela.

Lester's cozy suburban home encloses his frigid wife and remote daughter, and for him it's a loveless shelter when he's not at work in his dead-end job.  Then something happens: On the verge of losing his job, Lester quits and blackmails his boss for a generous severance package. Now free, after a fashion, he entertains lustful thoughts of Angela while buying weed from Ricky, who unbeknownst to Lester, has become Jane's lover.  Freed from the daily grind, and with Ricky and Angela seeming to urge him on, Lester recreates himself as a teenager, directionless and determined at the same time. His approach to life disdains the carpediem that typified Hollywood ""Dead Poets"" rip-offs of the early 1990's for something more along ""let the day pass you by."" His wife, determined to succeed in real estate, is revealed not just amoral, but stunningly shallow - a walking manifestation of sheer materialism and ostentation. All who populate ""Beauty"" live in some illusion - Lester with his renewed youth, Carolyn and her dreams of success, Ricky and Sarah and their fantasies of a future together, Angela's fantasy of herself on the cover of ""Elle"", Ricky's father's mirage of the all-American family..etc. After meandering, the script decides that somebody will have to wake up and take reality on the chin for everybody else - and the script settles on Jane and Ricky.  Bad move: Jane and Ricky prove so mature in their love for each other, that they prove better able to wake up and smell the coffee than the rest of the cast.  Instead of a searing portrait of the disintegration of family life, Ricky and Jane prove that love and the family is alive and well.  The closer they get, the more we realize that Jane won't be destroyed by her self-loathing, and that Ricky's not really a psycho at all.  (If children are our future, then we could do far worse than Ricky and Jane.)  As Ricky and Jane straighten themselves out. The rest of the flick seems out of whack - as if the script suddenly became terrified of its capacity for mass destruction and wanted to turn into a sunny parody of its earlier self.  Jane contemplates life without bust enlargement; Carolyn's crass materialism, never disavowed, is mollified by her affair and possible love for her competitor in the real estate market (surprisingly refreshing Peter Gallagher); and Lester's attraction for Jane's friend is more mutual than irony should allow.  The only constant in this perfect storm is Ricky's father, a die-hard Marine whose only apparent role is to set the story firmly in America (apparently the only Western nation that British-born director Sam Mendes can conceive of teeming with right-wing, jingoistic, homophobic, militaristic robots).

The script's sudden risk-shyness infects the characters so, that by the end of the film, all they can do is feel satisfied with each other. Even Lester, the most beaten down of them all, feels fine.

I enjoyed the leads of this flick enough to overlook how otherwise overrated it really is. ""American Beauty"" never exploits its fictional setting to achieve any sharper edge on a now well-worn theme of the darkness underlying American family life. Surprisingly, it never explains the film's core plot point: Burnham's dramatic character shift (occurring in the film, but apparently late in life).  We get the idea that people have treated him like dirt for ages, yet in the first shot, he's already equipped to turn the tables on his boss and his wife, and attract Angela as well.

What undermines the film the most is the persistent hint that those on the other side of the camera may be in thrall to the greatest illusion of all - that this really is a deep look at the shattered psyche of the American family that hasn't been done to death decades ago.",2.0
"Besides the funny moments in this film, there is nothing good about it. Kevin Spacey delivers some very funny moments and the music in the movie is good but the movie itself isn't good at all. First of all, it's nothing about beauty. So don't expect this movie to be beautiful. It's disturbing and grotesque. I'm sure that everyone probably agrees with me that there is normally a protagonist in movies. Well, not here. There are no heroes but only perverted and strange people.

There's the frustrated dad who doesn't get any sex from his wife and whose daughter hates him. He only is freed from his problems with his family when he falls in love with his daughter's best friend. I know, that's disgusting. So now, he's working out, blackmails his boss, smokes pot and does whatever he wants. No hero there.

The girl that he falls in love with is obssessed with sex and finds herself to be ""not oridinary"" and beautiful. She's very dirty and isn't a hero.

Then, there's his wife, the realtor who likes material possessions and cheats on him and doesn't seem to care. She calls herself a victim, and may I ask: ""of what?"" You're rich, you have a family, how the hell are you victim? And then she even considers killing her husband because she's a victim. And she doesn't even know that he is fantasizing about someone. Wow. No hero there.

Then there's their daughter who hates both of them, especially her dad. For what reason? I don't know! She even jokes about wanting to kill him. That's not a very pleasant joke! She wants breast implants even though she has large enough ones. (She flashes her boyfriend). No hero there.

Then, there's the daughter's boyfriend. He's a psycho who films everything and sells pot secretely. When you're supposed to like him, it's hard to.

Then there's the boyfriend's dad who is a veteran army lieutenant. He's abusive and very violent and mean. And he has some skeletons in his closet. No hero there either.

See, the movie was hard to watch because you don't like any of the characters in the movie. It was depressing to see our society shown as it is and without any character that you like, well...

The movie had too many sex references and also had lots of uneccessary and weird stuff. Like when Kevin Spacey's character fantacizes, WEIRD!

The worse for me though is that I had lots of high expectations for this movie and it ended out being nothing spectacular, just a mediocre and not memorable movie. The acting is good as are some jokes, but it really isn't what everyone says it is. It's not original and is very strange. There were also many random scenes in it and well...

I don't even recommend it for a rent unless you want to see what the fuss is all about but the academy must have different opinions than me because this movie didn't deserve best picture. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey as usual in a very strong performance but the movie wasn't strong or interesting. It was about a man breaking free thanks to an 18 year old girl that he falls for but unfortunately the movie didn't do what I thought that it would.

"It must have been ESP which kept me from seeing this movie for so many years as I found it extremely disappointing and incredibly overrated.  Although, it is undeniable that Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are wonderful in their roles, and that the camera work is quite impressive.  However, these are the few elements in the film that actually do impress.

The amount of mindless cliches inherent to these characters is appalling.  American Beauty never fails to present people through the looking glass of trendy, political correctness.  Nowhere is this more true than with the gay couple, Jim and Jim.  They are the only normal adults in the movie.  By depicting them as a picture of stability, normality, and kindness, it is apparent, amidst the dysfunctionality everywhere else, that the creators are more concerned with trying to make a positive statement about homosexuality than present a meaningful film.  If all gay men formed the strong bonds these two possess, then there would never be any stigma to homosexuality in the first place.  The fact is that only within the gay male population do you find, when polled, anyone who's ever had 10,000 or more lifetime sexual partners.  Of course such a level of promiscuity is not the norm, but the majority do not live in mansions out in the suburbs with tax attorneys. What we see here, unfortunately, is pure spin.

Even worse, and completely inexcusable, is the rendering of the Marine Colonel, Mr. Fitts.  Unlike the role model gay couple who, despite being a statistical abnormality, are actually representative of some gay Americans, I'm willing to bet that the Colonel is like no military man on this earth.  Certainly, he is nothing like any that I have met in my 35 years.  Fitts is an utter fiction produced by the mind of someone who hates this nation and our armed forces.

The Colonel's method of leading his family is to beat him son and force him to take semi-annual drug tests.  His wife is even less a real person than he is.  She's a refugee from Valley of the Dolls and has been demoralized to the point of appearing a zombie.  From the moment we encounter Fitts, his accent and style of speech should alert anyone familiar with Hollywood's methods that he will be an example of intolerance.  Whenever one hears rural inflections on the big screen, one must realize that the individual will be endlessly derided by the tofu mandarins who intolerantly judge the rest of us from their perches on the left coast.  After all, in the moviemaker's configuration, only sadistic, close-minded, evil men would ever volunteer to defend the United States in the first place.

That they could actually try to pass off this World War I drill master as a Colonel, let alone an actual human being, speaks volumes of how little they know about the armed forces and the disdain they have for the brave individuals who guard us while we sleep.  One cannot avoid having the impression that the director and screenwriter had never previously even met a member of the Marine Corps.

The Colonel comes straight (sic) out of the GLSEN handbook for homophobia.  He is a caricature, the type of person ""whose hate will not save him.""  We discover, just as the politically correct manuals would predict, that he himself is secretly gay.  Well, of course he is, isn't everyone who disagrees with gay activists?  His existence is meant to dupe us into thinking that homophobia is not really a hysterical fabrication even though the character they choose to convey this is unquestionably a fabrication.  He is a creation stemming from heterophobia and paranoia in regards to masculinity.  The Colonel would rather kill his own son than allow him be gay which should alert every viewer that the film is utter propaganda  The last thing American Beauty wants to do is say something important about human nature.

Just for the record, homosexuality is not something an officer in the Marine Corps would find very earthshaking.  How could he given that the Colonel was immersed in a male only culture for the majority of his professional career?  Fitts probably had to first deal with it a month after his enlistment began.  I bet he would have gotten over its uniqueness by the end of basic training.  We will soon have more opportunities to judge this director's opinions as he has just finished making the film ""Jarhead.""  I have no doubt that in it he  will more fully manufacture negative imagery regarding the world's most selfless soldiers.

This horrendous portrait of suburbia never fails to disappoint.  A world that is steeped with narcissism, materialism, and constant sex is definitely an accurate snapshot of the mandarins dwelling in Hollywood, but it has no correlation with the great number of Americans who choose to live outside our major metropolises.",2.0

My original review must be erased because it was overly pious and advocated outright rejection of the perverted hoodlums of Hollywood.

"4 stars for the crisp cinematography, flawless performances, and incomparable artistry.

0 stars for the mindless message.

Poor Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). Society pushes him to the breaking point and then punishes him for breaking. Can't a guy just be left alone to pursue his own depravity (taking drugs, having sex with children) and not have to worry about responsibility? This is all ""the man's"" fault.

"This is suburban life? How many books do you see in the Burnham household? The mother and the father have absolutely no interest in anything outside their jobs, i can hear people saying 'well isn't that what suburban life is like?' no, it isn't, oh well, Hollywood has misrepresented every other group in society over the years i guess we can't expect them to do any better with the middle classes. The only moment where Spacey's character touches reality is when he bemoans having to miss the James Bond marathon on tv because of his daughter's cheerleading. Come on, the mother listens to South Pacific at the dinner table, we're off in Hollywood lala land...
The screenplay is one of the laziest most hackneyed pieces of writing i've ever come across, veering between shallow and predictable teen soap opera and something akin to american pie. The 'at least i'm not ugly' 'yes you are, you're ugly on the inside' moment is as cheap as they come, it even brought a celebratory roar out of the audience and a few springeresque whoops. Also, the screaming of ridiculous things at the point of orgasm is as tired a joke as they come, it got the biggest laugh in the cinema. And of course the [friend] is really a virgin, and when he finds out Lester Burnham decides not to do her right there on the sofa.
The film could prbably get away with it if it did just declare itself to be american pie lite, but it doesn't, it makes sure you don't leave the cinema believing it to be anything other than an 'art' film by slowing the pace and holding sterile (but beautifully composed!) images for an eternity. It reminded me a bit of Zabriskie Point in that respect.
Irony of this movie is that the shell shocked wife and the homophobic husband next door are more endearing than the central family, that is until he turns out to be an abusive repressed self hating homosexual homocidal nazi fantasist (doh). Can't Alan Ball write an oppressive and domineering father without adding these ridiculous traits? What kind of idiocy is this? I always thought that the mindsets mocked in Woody Allen films were a myth, turns out they exist! They belong to Hollywood writers. Kids, if your father is strict PLEASE take heed of this film, check under his bed for the copy of the protocols of the elders of zion and examine your shower unit because the moment he hits you when he finds out you're involved in drugs he's not far from shooting someone dead. I'm only being as immature as the script.
You can argue that the scripts childish exaggerations are necesary to make the film's points hit home (what points?) and create some kind of violent dramatic finale where the protagonist is gunned down (even good american films like Affliction will resort to this, fine, because in that film it is justified) and life affirming realisations and epihanies occur. But really it's an awful lot easier to write such ridiculous characters than actually writing anything genuine and of substance. One can entertain the notion that it is a witty subversion, or a parody of sorts but the truth is its just a very weak piece of self adoring (without any concievable justification) satire with ideas above its station.  it's a smug, facile mediocre comedy that believes itself to be important, its not 'art' (or even very entertaining its so torturously slow and self impressed), it's not anything approaching the 'truth' and it sure isn't a 'wake up call' to any nation.
And as for the plastic bag in the breeze... Dude, deep, metaphorical. 'Look Closer', tried, nothing to see here, move along. And they reckon foreign language films are pretentious. The thanking of the plastic bag (apprarently without irony) upon the award of the oscar was truly hilarious. There was gushing, crying and hugging that somehow avoided the mockery that Halle Berry, Gwyneth Paltrow and other embarassing blubberers provoked. Only the 'Life is beautiful' 'director' and his academy award winning performance (and no i am not talking about his acting in the film) have nauseated me more, and to be honest i suspect that was more to do with the film than his live antics. Nice to see quite a few positive reviews of this film on this page resort to abusing (sometimes with name calling! oooh! others with Oscar Wilde) those that didn't find it to be the masterpiece they maintain.
And as for the drug dealing teen, i'm sure all of you suburbanites out there knew drug dealers when you were younger, were any of them like this guy? Did they have everything together? Were they competent and business like? Not the ones i knew, they were walking a tightrope most of the time, totally disorganized in all aspects of their life. He's been in a Psychiatric institution for a couple of years and as a result he's totally at ease with himself (?)
Really if it weren't for a couple of excellent comic performances this film would be utterly worthless. Mendes next film 'The Road To Perdition' with its reverent self importance, silent gun battles in torrential rain and 'carry on dillinger' second half was pretty awful too, but he's young, handsome and british with a theatrical background who pened his film career with a massive success, so he's a big talent who will be around for a long time doubtless continuing to receive mindboggling comparisons to Orson Welles for as long as his critical stock lasts (hm, apart form anything else i thought Citizen Kane was a box office flop?). Kevin Spacey has since made one of the worst films of its decade 'Ordinary Decent Criminal' and some of us have sat through the excruciating 'Pay it Forward' on vhs, does this guy need a wake up call or what? He's fast dissappearing up his own oscar. But he is critically untouchable it seems, these films didn't even register.

"Granted, it would have been nice of Universal to release the relevant disks in this set in the original 3-D; after all, 13 Ghosts, for instance, can be viewed at home as its director intended. However, I'm willing to make allowances based on the fact that there's really not a whole lot of 3-D product out there. No, my complaint is based on Universal's having released the set in the wrong aspect ratio; the releases are presented full-frame, despite the theatrical releases' having been shot (and exhibited) widescreen (naysayers can confirm by checking out DVD Savant's review). Would it have been so much trouble to have released nice, correctly cropped, anamorphic prints, especially since they would have cost no more to produce than pan-and-scan? Add this to your list of complaints to Universal--maybe they'll at some point start releasing product with the respect it deserves if enough people gripe (although I, for one, doubt it).",2.0
"American Beauty is perhaps one of the best examples of the fact that if you can be ""counter-culure"" then you will always have the sympathy of the critics.
The story is essentially what teen-agers used to refer to as ""Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll"". In fact, the story has the feel of what a teenager would write. This is supposedly a critique of suburban culture, but other than being set in suburbia, there is little here that is particular to suburbia.
The story's central character is a father who is disatisfied with his life. He lusts after his daughter's friend, his wife is focused on her career, and his daughter has the usual teenage angst over life, etc. His neighbour, who is not the business type, inexplicably reads the Wall Street Journal, (which any young person can tell you is the mark of an evil man). The neighbour's son sells drugs, so that makes him sympathetic and also means that he has a deep understanding of the human condition. Of course, the writers must have realized that drug dealers are not necessarily sympathetic characters to those over 20, so they made sure that the father (remember he reads the Wall Street Journal), is a man who viciously beats his son. In addition, there is another twist to his character that is straight out of an episode of Oprah.
Our protagonist, disatisfied with his life, decides to quit his well paying job, which he felt was de-humanizing, and get a job at a burger joint (which is apparently not de-humanizing). He starts to do drugs and listens to classic rock tunes and his life is suddenly better. (See what I mean about the type of story that only a young kid can appreciate?) Alas, his wife doesn't go along with this. She wants to do well at her career and doesn't like it when our hero isn't careful to not dirty the furniture. Clearly, she is not ""with it man."" (Forgive the 60's phraseology, but that is where this movie belongs).
One tired cliche after another is brought out to prove what is wrong with America, though frankly, none of the things they are criticizing are particular to America. (Oops, I forgot: Wall Street Journal = Evil).
So why 2 stars instead of 1? The acting is quite good, and there is a certain dreamy like quality to the directing that hides some of the juvenile nature of the plot.

"I have purchased the original Monster Legacy Set and plan on getting the next three installments to complete the set when released.  While it would be nice to have busts for The Mummy, The Invisible Man, and The Creature From The Black Lagoon; what is far more important is that Universal finally does The Creature installment justice and offer it as it was shown originally in theatres.  If this volume to The Legacy Collection is not offered in this manner, it will be a very huge flaw to an otherwise perfect collection (the Abbott and Costello films don't belong here because they are untrue to the intent and spirit of these characters).  I am asking that everyone interested in The Creature From the Black Lagoon and/or The Legacy Collection in general go to the web site [...] and e-mail the company and demand, as I have done, that they offer The Creature in a dual 3-D/regular black and white option format.  As I had stated to Universal, I am willing to bet that the large majority of fans would be willing to pay a little extra for this option.  Please do it while there may still be time because if enough people demand this, it may work, even if it means that The Creature's release is delayed until say December.  With the 3-D option available my rating would subsequently increase to 5 stars pending further review.",2.0
"If it wasn't for the cinematography and acting, would this be considered a great movie?  I don't think so.  To me it's mostly style over substance, and derivative and imitative as well.  Examples:  A middle-aged suburban guy discovers his life is empty and his job is demeaning.  Wow, there's a new one.  Second, the teenage daughter hates her parents and feels unwanted.  Gee, how original.  Third, the wife is frigid and controlling - there's some imiginative thinking for you!  And the kid next door is a loner and considered weird, but turns out to be sensitive and wise.  Again, what originality.
Most every scene is predictable and hackneyed.  Example:  The retired Marine next door is greeted by his gay neighbors with a welcome basket (fruit, of course).  The SECOND he opened the door for these two gay neighbors I knew the tough-guy, homophobic Marine would turn out to be secretly gay himself!  Trite and obvious.
And what about the similarities with Fast Times at Ridgmont High??  Yes, you heard me correctly.  Examples:  The most beautiful girl in Fast Times (Phoebe Cates) claims to be sexually active, yet is not!  A.B., same story with the luscious blond cheerleader.  In American B., we have an honest, ordinary guy searching for meaning and his place in life (Kevin Spacey).  In  F. T., same role played by Judge Reinhold.  Isn't Kevin Spacey just playing the grown-up Judge Reinhold?  In American B., there's the dark-haired loner dude, who finds true love in the end.  In F.T., same story with the wise-cracking Italian kid!
The only character in American Beauty who pulled me in and made me care, the only character who was unique and intriguing, was the Marine's wife.  What a lonely, defeated woman.  I wanted to know more about her and a lot less about the other characters.
And the ending involves a gun and a shooting.  Boy, that's a first!  No originality there at all - very disappointing.

"The best description of this movie is it is a cartoon.  Kevin Spacey seems to be acting with his tongue in cheek.  Annette Benning over-emotes to the point of being laughable; the makeup on her lover is so ridiculous as to seem to have been for a high school play.  As for the story, Mendez seems to have been making it up as he filmed it, and when he doesn't know what to do next, he throws in a sex scene. Most of the sex scenes are okay, that is they stop short of really grossing you out. I think everyone misread this movie.  It seems to aim to be a satire, but turns out just to be a lame comedy.  You can't really like anyone in the story, certainly neither of the teen-age girls, who are probably pretty typical, nor any of the adults.  The young drug dealer turns out to be the most likeable, and he's got problems. (...)",2.0
"First, I love American Beauty.  In recent years, The Matrix and Crouching Tiger are the only other films I've seen more than once while still in first-run theaters, and American Beauty has much more substance than either of those.  This movie is not an ""ugly look at life"" as some have said.  It is an extremely hopeful look at life.  Lester is a very real character that can be easily identified with, and everybody who feels that in some way their life has become a pathetic routine of dull existence can find assurance in the message that there's always time to make something of your life.  The opening narration very clearly states this as Kevin Spacey says:
""Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and they're right.  I have lost something.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated.  But you know what?  It's never too late to get it back.""
This movie is an inspiring message wrapped up in fun humor, great music, and beautiful cinematography.  The director states that it is a movie about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment.  I'm shocked at the number of people who just don't get it.  The people I know personally who don't like American Beauty aren't actually friends of mine, and they generally have that cranky, going-nowhere attitude about life.  (...) Does Lester's mundane life hit a little too close to home?
The closest thing to a legitimate criticism is that the movie glorifies a would-be pedophile.  People who say this need to pay more attention.  Lester is a middle-aged guy who isn't getting any at home, and Angela is constantly giving him eyes.  He even hears her shouting the obscene things she wants to do to him.  She claims to have had more sex as a teen than Lester has in his whole life.  Then Lester finds out his wife is ""getting nailed by the King of Real Estate.""  It's understandable that his affection shifts from his wife to Angela.  Once Lester finds out the truth about Angela, we see a nice guy who wouldn't think of touching her.  Lester is a normal man who shows a moment of human weakness when a young girl is coming on strong.  If you think that makes him a pedophile, I'd hate to see your opinion of Kuberick's Lolita, where an even older man is very actively pursuing an even younger girl.  Just look at the facts.  Mena Suvari was 20 when the movie was made.  She plays a high-school girl who is old enough to drive, meaning her character is between the ages of 16 and 18.  16 is above the age of consent in 39 of 50 US states.  This film does not glorify a pedophile.
(...) Yes, it is somewhat unpleasant seeing Lester get his brains blown out, but if they wanted gore, they would've shown the exit wound and made the blood darker, instead of making a bright puddle to match the red theme of the film.  Yes, the movie shows young girls' breasts, but I don't see anybody accusing Traffic of being child pornography, and that has graphic depiction of a teenage girl whoring herself for drugs.  The beauty lies in the transformation of Lester.  I feel sorry for anybody who doesn't fill with joy at the beginning of chapter 21.  I'm not a big fan of The Who, I don't run marathons, and I don't aspire to flip burgers, but when the film cuts to Lester running down the middle of the street to &#8220;The Seeker,&#8221; it makes me glad to be alive.
Anyway, the DVD itself is a real disappointment.  Look at the name of the DVD.  ""The Awards Edition.""  It should've been called the (...) Edition.  This DVD was specifically made so that fans would end up purchasing the DVD twice when the REAL version is released.
OK, maybe it's not that bad...  It DOES have both DTS and Dolby 5.1 audio, and it is one of the few DVD's that doesn't make you sit through a minute of obnoxious ""don't copy this"" warnings.  It DOES have two trailers, audio commentary, a featurette which just says, ""This movie is great!"", and a ""storyboard presentation.""
So let me tell you what the problems are.  Just try to watch the hour-long storyboard special feature.  Particularly annoying is that it is one single 61-minute chapter.  It's really just a 49-image slideshow being discussed by the director and cinematographer.  The first 22 minutes of the presentation are spent discussing chapter 1-4 of the DVD.  The rest of the presentation skips around discussing chapter 5-18 of the DVD, and it ends abruptly without touching on the last 10 chapters.
The most important flaw is heard when listening to the director commentary.(...)
If you listen to the commentary, it's obvious that a ""deleted scenes"" section has already been compiled and prepared for the DVD, but they chose not to include it with ""The Awards Edition.""  Nobody in their right mind would say, ""I think people would rather see this horrible and incomplete storyboard discussion instead of the deleted scenes.""  It is clear that Dreamworks just wants to force the true fans to buy the DVD twice to get the version with the deleted scenes.  Expect to see &#8220;American Beauty: Special Edition&#8221; in a year or two.",2.0
This movie was good but it rip off one of the best movies of the 90'es a film called Happiness. A brillent protray of the dark side of Suburbia. I will admit American Beauty had better photography but thats about it there are so many things the same with both movies. The only two difference is Happiness came out a year earler (thats why its riping it off) and Happiness is way more contreversail and is for adults only before you watch American Beauty watch Happiness than you decide.,2.0
"I have to say honestly that this movie upset my stomach.  I know that many will say that the symbolism and lighting among other production qualities were magnificent, but when you get right down to what the characters are doing--the plot, I was pretty disgusted.  The dream scenes and the reality scene were basic child molestation.  I believe this movie was nothing more than art for art's sake.

"Yes, everyone is having some type of crisis in this movie, after all they live in Suburbia don't they?  The actors do a good job with the material provided, but the script is so loaded with cliches that no amount of acting ability can bring the characters to life.  'The Ice Storm' provides a more detailed (and believable) look at suburban families in crisis.  'American Beauty' on the other hand tries to substitute cynicism for insight.  This is pretty commonplace these days.  It gives screenwriters the chance to congratulate themselves for 'deep' material and film critics the chance to use terms like 'dysfunctional family'.  It doesn't make a great movie however.  Worth a rental if you haven't seen it, just to see what the buzz is (or was) about.",2.0
"Pitch-perfect dialogue, amazing performances, solid direction, glowing cinematography - American Beauty has all of these things.  Yet the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It aspires to European complexity while paradoxically wallowing in American sensationalism.  It tries to paint a subtle moral landscape with a gallon of latex semi-gloss and a roller, with lurid supporting characters that could have come from Ricki Lake's green room.
By now everyone knows that the story centers on Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), whose life has become an empty, materialistic nightmare with his disrespectful daughter and frigid wife (Annette Benning).  He changes things - a bit too drastically - and ends up becoming a blackmailer, a drug user, and a would-be pedophile.  That he changes his mind at the last minute and doesn't have sex with the teenaged girl, that he ends up martyred because the next-door neighbor thinks (through a bizarre misunderstanding) that he's been taking sexual advantage of his son, that he has some New-Aged revelation about the Circle of Life as he's dying...well, all that's supposed to make him OK.
If American Beauty had committed to making Lester either a villain or a hero, it might have worked better.  Instead, it asks us to see him as a flawed, complex man - and forgive him.  That might been possible, had this loopy, creaky, arbitrary series of plot devices not been employed in place of a real story.
For every theme explored in American Beauty, better films exist.  Either film version of Lolita, for example, develops the theme of middle-aged crisis coupled with pedophilia far more logically and empathetically, and without resorting to an unconvincing, last minute change of heart to ""redeem"" the main character.",2.0
"As always Kevin Spacey does a great job but in my opinion it doesn't deserve an Oscar!
Oh yes after you see the movie, you know that such stories usually get Oscars. But no one can understand why! If you analyze the movie deeply you'll see that it has to do with Hollywood stereotype against a specific type of discrimination! This is becoming the ""American Beauty"" trend since the early 90s!
I give one Star for good acting + one Star for a nice way of telling a bad story with a shocking tragical ending... that is all!",2.0
"'American Beauty' is just complete rubbish from beginning to end.  It pretends to be deep and profound, but it is actually shallow and manipulative.  It tires to find quick and easy solutions to people's problems and does not consider the long term conquences.  For example, the main character (Kevin Spacy) quits his professional job to work in a fast-food resturant.  At first he may enjoy it, but how long could he sustain that lifestyle.  How long could he be happy working minimum wage.  Also, his daughter is ready to run away with her drug-dealer boyfriend.  How long do you think such a relationship could last?  The movie does not consider these consequences.  Think about the characters' actions and apply them to real life and you will realize 'American Beauty' is full of crap.",2.0
"What ""American Beauty"" is supposed to be about involves a dysfunctional American suburban family who suffers uncommon everyday social problems. The idea of the dad being attracted to her daughter's friend is more frequent in real life than most people believe. But, I don't think it was done right when Kevin Spacey did drugs and other things to impress her. This didn't show any reaction from his daughter. This was a lot like a Jerry Springer episode.
 The entire main idea of this movie was very flawed because reaction to the situation was only seen through the eyes of Kevin Spacey: not of his wife or his daughter. It's like your looking for the hamburger buns and you're obviously in the dairy section. If you study this movie after you watch it a few times, you'll probably get the REAL idea of it.",2.0
"I heard so much hype about this movie in the fall of 1999! Even in Russia! I knew that I had to see it. I saw it, and vowed to never watch it again. The dialogue and acting was beyond superb but the storyline was not very good. The fact that it explored suburban dysfunction was nice, but all of the sex and vulgarity turned me off. There were a few funny moments in the movie, (ex: The family eating dinner together and Col. Fitts 'homophobe-ness'). Overall, not worth all the hype.",2.0
"This film has been so immoderately praised that it is time, perhaps, for a more sober assessment. And when you get below the hype there is not much here to get excited about. Take the acting. Kevin Spacey does not act particularly well in this film, in fact he hardly acts at all - he walks through the part, looking every bit as smug as he does when interviewed. To suggest that this role merited an Oscar is to lose any sense of what acting is all about. Similarly with the script: it is not bad, but hardly a masterpiece. In fact it is full of tedious, shop-worn, caricatures, the most unpleasant of them being the martinet father who turns out to be a repressed homosexual (natch!). Shades here of Lawrence's Prussian Officer. But if a writer has to resort to this kind of easy target then he is really not working hard enough. But then the whole script is just too easy. Does the film end up telling us anything new about a mid-life crisis? Not really. Poor Lester Burnham rediscovers the power of lust and a good workout. Good for him. Only the cinematographer, Conrad Hall, really deserved the Oscar that he got. The film looks good - unfortunately this beauty is really only skin deep.",2.0
"I don't want to just rehash what has already been said (and there are already over 500 reviews on this movie) but I did want to give my impression of the movie in a different way.
When I first entered college, I took an introduction to psychology course, taught by an especially gifted teacher.  Almost everyone in the class (myself included) was overcome by the ""Freudian Syndrome"" of believing every neurotic symptom described in the book applied to our lives.  Our teacher cheerfully explained this common phenomenon would occur and only those on the extreme end of the spectrum would be considered truly sick.
This movie is one giant Freudian Syndrome.  The characters somehow connect with us because we have experienced their traumas at one point or another in our lives.  I tried not to be cynical, but I found it difficult to sympathize (or empathize) with any of the characters due to the fact that they are all so far ""out there"".  Not to mention, many other reviewers have already pointed out the numerous ""common sense"" problems of who they choose to interact with and the reasons given in the movie as to why each person made the choices they did.  In other words, these people aren't real - they're cartoon characters.
This movie was the introductory course (rental material).  If you liked this movie and you want the advanced course, then buy the movie that should have won Best Picture - Magnolia.",2.0
"Look closer... at what?  With all of the aclaim that _American Beauty_ has gotten, I was really expecting a great movie, complete with moving characters, a profound message, and a story line to stay with you long after the movie is over.  Most of these things are in _American Beauty_, except there is one glaring hole... the story line is sick and contrived making life seem like a whole soap opera-ish mess.  Kevin Spacey's character starts the movie by telling us he's dead.  This is a surprise, not many movies are told from the grave.  Then we are taken to the shower scene where Spacey's Lester Burnham is ""saying hello to his monster.""  In Lester's own words, it goes downhill from there (he may be talking about his day, I'm talking about the movie).  Lester's family is a complete wreck.  He's a wimp, his wife's an overzealous realator who's hopelessly miserable, and their daughter, Jane is the only normal person in the house.  She's a teenager going through the most aweful time of her life, so, needless to say, she doesn't help the family atmosphere too much.  Life gets a little more interesting for Les when he discovers his daughter's friend, Angela, and starts lusting after her.  Some say he falls in love, and I wonder where they got this idea.  Anyway, the movie goes on and on, Les drooling over Angelina, Jane falling in love with the interesting drug dealer next door, and Annet Benning's character finding that the way to wind down after a long day at work is to go to the shooting range and fire off a couple of rounds.  There was no point to the story line.  Most of the movie just depicts suburbia as a miserable place where no one is ever happy, and when they are, they are wishing they could screw a girl young enough to be their daughter.
The only, ONLY, redeeming thing about this movie is the message about beauty in our world.  The drug dealer next door sure got it right, but I really hope that there's not a message going out that the only way you'll really see beauty is if you're constantly high and you have a camera glued to your eye.  Seriously though, the filming the dead bird because it was ""beautiful"" was very touching and that will probably stay with you for at least a little while.  Probably the best part of the movie was that short scene with the little plastice bag dancing in the breeze.  If _American Beauty_ had focoused more on the beauty in the world then on the hate of one strange little town, it definitely would have been five star material.
All the actors and actresses were wonderful and really fulfilled their roles well.  And, the tiny message snuck in about beauty was wonderful.  However, all of these things did not make up for the strange and extremely lacking plot line.  If there had been something to care about and people that were interesting, _American Beauty_ would have been much better.  Save your money and your time.  If you wnat a message about true beauty, open your eyes a little more... this movie is not the way to get it.  If you think that way, I really feel sorry for you.",2.0
"All the raving about the film itself is well deserved.  If you're looking for great DVD picture quality, however, you'd best stay away from this one.
The encoding job is horrible, and glitches pop up all over the place.  Note the flickering mini-blinds in the for-sale house, jerkily-moving backgrounds during various pans, mirage-like effects on supposedly straight lines.  If you're a purist and care about picture quality, you should wait until they distribute a better version.  This disc demonstrates how DVD technology is not yet ready for prime time.",2.0
"It's a tragedy that this film won Best Picture (just as it was a tragedy that Shakespeare In Love one the year before, and even worse, Titanic the year before).  It's also a tragedy that this film was incredibly overrated by its viewers.  What does it say?  That so many people can ""relate"" to the desperate and pathetic characters of this suburbian hell-reality?
I thought some of the themes in this film were worthy of presentation.  How ridiculous society (not just middle-America) has become with its over-indulgence of material goods, loss of immaterial and spiritual wealth and wholeness, lack of closeness within the family unit, complete voidness of morals of values...it certainly is a shame!  But the danger of the message in the film is its existential ending, its answer being utter hopelessness and helplessness.  Please.  There are solutions to all of these problems, but unfortunately, neither the makers of the film nor the fans realize this even though they continually ask us to ""look closer.""
There is some unrealism that should be pointed out in the characters.  I didn't buy the whole ""closeted-homophobic military man"" character.  I'm not denying that such contradictions in human character exist, however, the film portrayed the character as someone who was mainly concerned with his son, not personal egocentric struggles.  I interpreted Cooper's character's final actions to be purely empathetic and wrathful.  When he kissed Lester Burnham, it was to empathize with his son whom he thought was engaging in homosexual activities with Spacey's character.  When he killed Burnham, it wasn't out of rejection of his homosexual pass, but out of anger for the prostitution of his son.
Certainly, the movie deserves some praise for its content, although it is not as original as people claim.  If I am not mistaken, ""Ice Storm"" incoporated similar themes, and in some ways, was a more successful film in representing society's moral grayness.  I thoroughly enjoyed Kevin Spacey's sarcastic, hedonistic character, (though I do not think it was Spacey's best performance as some have stated.  The deception he created in The Usual Suspects and mystery he upheld in Seven were, in my opinion, more oustanding, substantial, and challenging than his role in American Beauty will ever be) and did empathize with him in the end.
It is not surprising that this was a directional debut, as the director overwhelms the audience with its directed narration, leaving no intuitive challenge for the deeper viewer.  I personally desire movies that carry more subtle themes, challenging the audience to understand the meaning of the piece.  With American Beauty, the messages are so naked and apparent that it only encourages brainlessness viewing.
Overall, an average movie challenging deep themes.  It deserves this heavy criticism in order to counterattack all the false acclaims it has been given.",2.0
"After viewing ""American Beauty"" for the very first time, and I found myself confronted with the most viscerally negative reaction I can ever recall experiencing toward a film. Two words immediately spring to mind: DISAPPOINTMENT and OUTRAGE.  DISAPPOINTMENT, because the film simply lacks the requisite quality for the manifold awards and laurels it has received, and OUTRAGE, because this movie is billed as a ""provocative and wickedly funny"" satire, and a ""defining achievement in cinematic history."" Provocative, indeed, it is; ""wickedly funny,"" and ""a defining achievement,"" it most certainly is NOT!

""American Beauty""  is a film which purports to make a stinging social commentary about the barrenness of American life at the dawn of a new millennium, and the need for people to wake up and see beauty in their surroundings.  The vehicle for this message is ironically a pair of dysfunctional suburban families.  Meet the Burnhams:  Lester, a middle-aged ""burn-out"" at work; completely alienated from his hyperkinetic and overambitious wife, Carolyn, and his moody teenage daughter, Jane.  Meet also the Fittses:  Frank, a retired Marine Corps colonel - a rabid homophobe and an abusive ""control freak"" toward his voyeuristic, detached teenage son, Ricky, and his semi-catatonic wife, Barbara.

In a film which somehow seeks to educate its viewers on the beauty of life, we have scenarios like these placed before us:  Lester lusts after his daughter's girlfriend, a teenager with a wildly scatological mouth. He quits his $60,000 a year job and  takes a  job flipping burgers at a fast food joint, he buys his ""dream car,"" and he begins smoking pot.  Carolyn begins a torrid affair with a rival real estate agent, a fact which doesn't seem to bother Lester at all when he finds out about it.  Frank forces Ricky to give urine samples to test for drug use, and, fearing that his son is gay, beats on him repeatedly.  Jane begins sleeping with Ricky, and suggests he put her lecherous father ""out of his misery.""

All this in the name of ""beauty.""

""American Beauty"" is billed as a ""wickedly funny"" satire.  Now, when I read or hear the word ""satire,"" I immediately associate it with the word ""humor."" That humor can be black, acerbic, biting, ironic, or dry...it doesn't matter.  My point is, I believe that satire, in order to be effective, must be imbued with at least a modicum of humor.  And humor is one quality ""American Beauty"" does not possess.

I find nothing funny about  a 42-year old man engaging in overtly lewd daydreams about, and sexual overtures toward, a teenage girl;  nothing funny about  a homophobic, bigoted father forcing his son to give urine samples to test for drug use, or repeatedly beating on him for infractions of his ""rules;""  nothing funny about a man threatening violence toward his wife by throwing a platterful of asparagus at the dining room wall;  nothing funny about a teenage daughter wanting to see her father dead.

The only scenes in the entire movie which rise to the level of humor - albeit humor of the blackest variety - are the sex scene between Carolyn Burnham and Buddy Kane, the ""Real Estate King."" That, and the scene when newly cuckolded, burger-flipping Lester catches his wife with her aforementioned partner. Those scenes did, in fact, evoke from me a wry chuckle or two.

Now, I will concede, that ""American Beauty"" is an artistically and technically brilliant film. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, and Wes Bently all excel in their roles. Spacey may even have deserved his Oscar. The cinematography is superb. The screenplay is eloquent and lyrical.  Put these things together, and what you should come up with a masterpiece. Film critics, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the public at large all seem to think that's exactly what they've got...a masterpiece, I mean.

Alas, I do not share in that sentiment. For the life of me, I cannot understand why ""American Beauty"" remains such a critical and box-office success. Throughout this film's two hour, two minute running time, it remained for me little more than a lame attempt at witty social commentary, and a plodding, dreary film which was a drudgery to sit through.",2.0
"The only reason I gave this two stars, and not one, is I was intreged enough to watch it all the way through, though it took me two settings to complete it. The reason I had to watch it in two settings is because is was so completely depressing and going nowhere.  I was really annoyed by the Father who was love w/ a teen, (and not with his wife), the hysterical wife, and the doldrum daughter. The whole family wouldn't give the time of day to each other. The disturbing way the Colonial treated his son and others was also not inspiring.  Really, I can't remember when I was so depressed watching a film. I was puzzled beyond belief at how this movie recieved such possitive attention.",2.0
This movie is so overrated. The acting is good but its not that good. PLease how do people see beauty in a dead bird and a mans head shot with  blood coming out. The nudity was pointless and disturbing. Underage girls  breast is not beauty in this way more disguisting.,2.0
"I found this movie condescending and predictable. The notion that middle-aged folks in the suburbs can't see how unhappy they are has been  re-hashed by Hollywood so many times this movie hardly registers as  original. The cast is purely steroetypical fare: The mid-life  crisis-plagued Lester, his neo-Nazi ex-military neighbor, the baracudda  wife. The only character who deserves any sympathy is Lester's daughter,  who thanks to years of neglect is so starved for attention of any kind she  becomes involved with the drug-dealing death-obessesed boy next door.
What saves the vanilla screenplay is the fantastic acting and directing.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning turn out terrific performances. The  supporting cast is top-notch. The director keeps the movie interesting and  watchable but ultimately can't hide what it really is at it's core:  Hollywood's inability to understand the common man. Most of us regular  folks already know money isn't everything. We already know the importance  of being able to stop and smell the roses. But thanks for bashing us over  the head (literally) with your message.",2.0
"Much more fascinating than this film is the public's reaction to it.  Unlimited praise and a Best Picture Oscar made it seem as if there was no  one who didn't love this movie.  Perhaps it was because of this hype that I  was left disappointed by American Beauty.  I tried to see the genius that  was described in rave reviews and by everyone who had seen it, but all I  saw was a long string of cliches in a film that was far too long itself.  American Beauty was hailed as showing the truly shocking side of American  suburbia.  But there was nothing true or shocking about the portrayal of  family life in the movie.  Every character is extremely cartoonish, and  it's difficult to care about any of them.  Though I was supposed find  Lester Burnam appealing for his frustrations with middle-age life, his  character was self-centered and very irritating.  Luckily he wasn't as  irritating as Annette Benning's character, whose shrill voice and  cartoonish personality made for a highly overrated performance.  It's  disappointing that an actress of such talent was given such a  one-dimensional role.  The film deals with issues that are old and  overused, and it says nothing original on these issues.  With this film,  there is one word that sums everything up: overrated!",2.0
"After watching David Lynch's masterpiece A Straight Story I had the misfortune of sitting through American Beauty.  I liked Kevin Spacey's  performance, except for his idiotic monologue at the end.  This is one of  those movies that make me talk back to the screen, with insulting remarks.  Move it along, director!  Shoddy work can't be excused by inventive plot  twists.  Yes, it's politically correct to dislike the ex-marine who smacks  his kid around, collects guns, and is a hard nose, and sure it's easy to  take the cheap shot at this caricature and call him a closet queen.  You  may think this is cutting edge, but I think it's just a cheap shot at an  obvious target.  I couldn't stand the movie before most of this happened,  so my dislike goes deeper than just this.  This is just not a quality job.  The director just did a lousy job.  That's my reaction.",2.0
"First of all, I think that it's pretty sad that a movie about a disfunctional family would win an Oscar for Best Movie!  Now that I got  that off my chest...I've seen 4 of the 5 movies that were nominated for  Best Movie of 1999. Out of the 4, American Beauty was by far at the bottom  of my list. I strongly feel that The Green Mile or The Insider should have  won, followed by The Sixth Sense. I've watched American Beauty twice, and  if it weren't for Kevin Spacey, then I probably wouldn't have ever seen it.  Kevin Spacey is by far one of the best actors out there. His brilliant  performance as Lester makes this average movie worth watching at least  once. He definetly steals the show! Other then that, in my opinion, this is  an average movie. There was nothing exciting or climactic in the movie. The  best part of the movie had to be the last 15 minutes of the movie.  Everything throughout the movie all came to one.",2.0
"An entirely adequate movie that raises a lot of hot subjects (male mid-life crises, pedophilia, voyeurism, homosexuality, murder, etc.) and  then dances rather coyly around them for two hours, and then tacks on a  nice and uplifting message about the need to see the beauty around us.  That way, the foks at the mall can feel good about having sat through a  movie featuring blackmail, murder, and (gasp) sex!!!
This film owes a bit  too much to other much darker films, specifically The Ice Storm and sex  lies and videotape and Lolita and Happiness and Blue Velvet.  That American  Beauty is more accessible and less interesting than these films should come  as no surprise, I suppose, considering the quite unwarranted success of the  film.  American Beauty is Independent Cinema Lite.  It takes no hard  stance, takes no chances whatsoever, at least none that have not been taken  several times before by other, far more challenging films.
The best thing  about American Beauty is the high quality of the acting, in particular a  splendid performance from Wes Bentley, who really should have been  Oscar-nominated.  If I see American Beauty again, it will be to watch his  work.",2.0

"An American neighborhood, shown for what it really is, by an expert Hollywood eye: the miserable businesswoman putting on a phony, cheery face; the ""successful"" businessman whose life is collapsing; the  degraded husband suffering an extreme midlife crisis, who fantasizes about  his daughter's girlfriends; the girlfriend, a nymphet who likes to seduce  older men; and best of all, the new neighbors, the family of a retired  Marine Corps colonel. Since the colonel moralizes endlessly about the  abominations he sees around him, he's of course a neo-Nazi, his homophobia  a front for his closet homosexuality. Oh yeah, there are good guys -- the  one gay couple on the block are as sweet, virtuous, decent, tolerant and  well-adjusted as everyone else is screwed up, mean-spirited, and  phony.
Bad enough, that Hollywood ignorance and arrogance presumes, in  the persons of director Sam Mendes and screenwiter/co-producer Alan Ball to  be telling ""the truth"" about suburbia, but they think they're  doing Billy Wilder proud. They said so openly at the Oscars. This is clear,  as well, through the gimmick, copied from Sunset Boulevard, of the dead  protagonist's opening and closing narration. Mendes and Ball aren't fit to  carry Billy Wilder's director's chair.
For one thing, Wilder --  considered anything but subtle in his day -- wore silk gloves, in contrast  to the hamhanded doings here. More importantly, as cynical as he often was,  he didn't constantly remind you how superior he (thought he) was to his  characters. Well, at least we know that this picture's creators have  healthy self-esteem.
Every character in American Beauty is  one-dimensional, a prop in the filmmakers' anti-morality tale. The latter  apparently have an adolescent notion that people are good, only to the  degree that they do whatever they feel like at any given moment.
And yet,  the screenplay does have its funny moments, most of which involve Spacey,  the one character (the gay couple can't be counted: their brief,  superficial presence exists only to emphasize the homophobic colonel's  wickedness) for whom Mendes and Ball feel any sympathy. Much technical  skill is in evidence. And the cast does marvelous work. Kevin Spacey, in  particular, gives a performance for the ages, in this otherwise  conventionally PC, Hollywood concoction.
Having spent my entire childhood  in suburbia, I know its problems all too well. But Mendes and Ball don't.  Their movie is jaundiced, without the clear-eyed view typical of Wilder in  his prime. American Beauty is an ignorant, self-righteous exercise in  bigotry. In a just world, suburbanites would be able to make movies mocking  Hollywood hypocrisy, something like, ""Hey, I  Spend My Free Time and  Influence Getting Murderers Paroled ... So They Can Kill Again!"" Oops,  I forgot. That's not a movie; that's real life in Hollywood.",2.0
"I rented this movie expecting an insightful piece commenting on the state of American suburbia.  Instead I wasted 2 hours of my evening watching an average piece of drivel not really worthy of my time.  I am not complaining  about the portrayal of underage sex or the use of drugs or even the fact  that Hollywood portrays every ex military person as a closet homosexual  homophobic.  That is so common in movies today that it doesn't really  affect me.  What bothered me is that the script was so contrived and  formulaic.  I have heard so much about the beauty of the words and the  complexity of the story and how you don't see the end coming.  Please, you  know at the beginning that he is going to be dead and you know that the  killer will either be his neurotic wife or the psychotic marine next door.  And the phrases that I hear everyone quoting sound like they came off an  Oprah episode or a Hallmark card.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning did  give excellent performances and I did find myself laughing at parts of the  movie.

"This was a ridiculously written movie that shows the trouble that occurs when the children of the mega-rich 1% of the country, grow-up to become young Snooty-McUppity White College Grads obsessed with their ""High-Society-Male White-Privileged"" lives, to the extreme that they even get hung-up jealous of the quality of each other's business cards---even to the point of murder!  These are extremely arrogant, pompous, self-righteous morons who don't even have respect for their own White women---treating them as pieces of meat for their own selfish, sexual lusts with no regard to these White women's feelings or bodies; even having no qualms about injuring them sexually.  They also tend to lack respect or regard towards the women they're actually married-or-getting married to.

  With that being said, the absurdity in Christian Bale's character Patrick Bateman in his sociopathic & psychotic interactions with others in his Apt building, at his stock-trades job, & in his uppity community, are totally ludicrous & defy all common sense.  For example: How the hell could Patrick Bateman drag a huge duffel bag (with a chopped up body inside) across the lobby of his Apt building while leaving a solid-trail of blood in its path, during the wee hours of the morning---and right past the front-desk of the night doorman out to his car---without ever getting arrested?!  No police are ever called to check the blood-trail in the lobby?!  No security-cameras ever lead the Police to this monsters door?  Its an insult to the viewers intelligence to leave that obvious Forensic Evidence & Homicide Investigation out of the script.  The only Investigator thinks of Batemans co-worker as being on vacation---with all that blood on the lobby floor and DNA Forensics being as advanced as it is today where they could have easily  cross-compared the co-worker's medical records & DNA with the blood on the lobby floor of Bateman's Apt building?!  Again, it defies logic.

  And ridiculously, no one in Law Enforcement ever comes to ask any questions to the other Apt-Tenants about the White female prostitute (who Forensics would quickly show, was just treated a couple of days earlier for severe vaginal-injuries that Bateman caused), laying at the foot of the spiral staircase with a huge chainsaw sticking in her side, that Patrick Bateman murdered late at night as well?!  Again---its an insult to the viewers intelligence to leave that obvious kind of Forensic Evidence & Homicide Investigation out of the script.  This isn't the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where people were out in the middle of nowhere being butchered by Leatherface with nowhere to run.  All these events are happening right in one of the wealthiest communities in the big city of New York!  So all of this crap clearly defies logic.

  Im unapologetically disgusted with this movie, and thought by its title & trailer, that it was going to be a well-written script.  Instead I was disappointed and annoyed with the extremely selfish mentalities of these mega-rich White men and their backwards White-Privilege mentalities, coupled with the rich-sociopath whobecause of his White-skin & wealth--- conveniently gets to keep on killing with no ramifications whatsoever.  Clearly if it was a Black-or-Latino guy doing this, they would have locked his behind up with the very first killing of his fellow-wealthy male co-worker.",2.0

This movie is so over-rated... Bale was not good enough rate this anything above a two star SNOOZER!,2.0
"An oxymoron, I'm aware, but it's certainly the case here. American Psycho stars Christian Bale as an executive from the 80s who likes to kill people that he despises, which is mostly everyone. Don't worry, you won't feel too bad about it because there's nary a single character in this movie you'll like. That's American Psycho's biggest problem, there's no character, no rock on which to cling, to help you wade through the stream of inane dialogue and predictable plot progression. Everyone in the movie is either wholly unlikable or just too bland to even remember. So what's left then? An unforgettable performance by Christian Bale and some good cinematography, without a doubt. Unfortunately, that's not enough to save this shallow criticism of Reagan-era elites. By the time the plot twist in the final moments of the film occurred, I didn't care enough about the movie itself to even try to suss out the meaning of the ending. It's just a boring film. A technically well-done film, but very boring nonetheless. Don't waste your time.",2.0

Wasnt really a fan... didn't really make sense too much and disappointed with the ending,2.0
This was a very strange movie; not at all what we were expecting. Be ready for a commentary because Christian Bale narrates the entire movie.,2.0
"An energetic and committed performance and some cleverness throughout make this a mildly entertaining experience. However, the film itself is too prone to openly exposing its shallowness. It has the ingredients to make the social and psychological commentary it wants, but the film never delves as deeply into them as it could. Things get a little redundant after awhile, because for whatever reason the script doesn't seem too concerned with developing things beyond surface-level. Bateman's development over the film goes like this: murderous psycho to suddenly extra murderous with side of unraveling. Just like that. That's how it works. It's an abrupt shift that doesn't feel quite right. The ending too abruptly switches gears and lends itself to what I think is supposed to be surrealism, but it's almost too literal. It screams ""DELUSIONAL. HEY, DO YOU KNOW HE'S DELUSIONAL? OH, MAYBE HE'S REALLY THIS AND THAT."" Harron's approach doesn't strike the balance between psychological horror and biting satire very well. It's all sort of empty in the end. There doesn't seem to be a lot of point to it when the film can't effectively tackle things and, even more so, give depth or reason to what it's trying to say. That and there's no emotional depth to it, which might not have been a problem had the film had more depth in general.",2.0
"I just want to provide a review of the bluray quality for fans who were looking toward purchasing this movie for their collection.  Id have to say the bluray transfer is not as good as it could be. I was personally very disappointed when hoping for a HD version. Right off the top of the movie, there are lots of pops and marks that appear from the film transfer. As far as the clarity of various actors skin and clothing, its all VERY blurred and smudgy compared to what Ive seen to date. Its definitely better than a dvd, but not as good it should be. Im sure there will be a better transfer in the future, so Id wait until then to purchase this version.",2.0
"The plot was weak, the acting was strange, and I had to watch Equilibrium after this just so that Christian Bale could redeem himself.",2.0
"Director Mary Harron unleashes a major disappointment. ""American Psycho"" (2000) loses its satirical venom at the halfway mark  degenerating into slasher-movie clichs. A tour de force portrayal from Christian Bale is not enough to sustain this uneven adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial 1991 novel. The film's limp conclusion only emphasizes its wasted potential.",2.0
its a very superficial movie about the life of a sociopathic killer. not a whole lot of character or storyline depth,2.0
"I heard good things about it randomly on the internet so decided to give it a watch.

The way the main character acts is very.. interesting to say the least. I recently finished watching movies with the Hannibal Lector character who is also psycho. That character in that movie was great and spooky. This character is extremely random and constantly energetic. It's actually kind of boring for me to see someone so jumpy that is psycho because it almost makes the mood seem happy even though it should feel somewhat suspenseful.. It's not eerie at all.. not scary in the slightest. It does make you want to finish it to see what the hell is going on, but in the end, nothing is answered. It's so open and unsatisfying that it's just.. sad realizing that I watched the whole thing.",2.0

Christian Bale as of late has come into his own I love the movies he head been in and he always plays his role with a great amount of care and is very convincing. this movie shows how an actor fine tunes his skills with roles and movies as they are added to their resume. didn't like it it wasn't his best work done the story line was not gripping.,2.0

"The premise seems forced and overdone, the ""twist"" was predictable, and no real social commentary was achieved.

"The funny thing is, when this movie came out in the movie theaters, it rated only 2 out of 5 stars. It received the worst reviews of that year. All of a sudden, people are giving it 5 star ratings??? C'mon, people. The movie is TERRIBLE. It actually makes fun of itself (the scene where Bateman shoots and blows up the cop car, and he stares at the gun, for example). The movie never really makes sense.
HOWEVER.... I happen to love this movie! It is absolutely HYSTERICAL. It was supposed to be some kind of thriller, but it ends up being just a really dark comedy. After all these years, and having been probably the only person laughing out loud in the movie theater on release night (people were actually walking out of this one), I have seen how this movie has become a cult classic. But, that doesn't mean a cult classic is actually a good movie.
Buy this movie if you like dark, REALLY dark humor. There are scenes that will have you cracking up whenever you even think about it (the menage trois scene, for examply lmao). As long as you don't take the movie seriously, you will definitely love it.",2.0

Like Hitchcock after Psycho, this film feels tired and bloated, and incoherent too boot.  I remember seeing this film in real time, and feeling the same way, although I was a mere slip of a lad who still had hair.  Well, John Forsythe in a hat is always a welcome presence, and Dean Wormer (John Vernon) as Fidel or is it Che, remains riveting.  But, this film doesn't go on any all-time lists.",2.0
"As much as I would have liked to have given this film 5 stars because it was the only one to have been critical of the dictatorship I cannot do so in good conscience. Incidentally, the plot of this movie was based on a true story of espionage: a Russian high official defected with his family and fingered a spy ring in the highest level of France.

All right, why did this film lack the usual Hitchcock touch? Unlike Psycho, the score was terrible as was the dialogue. There were spots where the acting was wooden. Karin Dor's acting was at times overdone. Several times when suspense was going to build up simply failed to do so. Having said that, there were several very good spots scattered here and there.",2.0
"I love this movie, I have since I rented about 5 years ago.  I dont' really understand it, I guess I should read the book, but I think It's a really well done movie.  Of course Bale is great, i love him as bateman and I also loved the period of the film.  The special features on this edition are a different story.  The version I already had only included one short featurette that was interesting, but short, and left me wanting more.  So, naturally I thought I struck gold with the ""uncut killers edition"".  Too bad most of the special features have NOTHING to do with the movie.  A group of about 20 totally random people comment, one at a time, on new york in the eigthies for about an hour. I know that sounds weird, and it is, but its true.  TOTALLY RANDOM  people that had nothing to do with the movie (most of them). Honestly, I haven't watched the movie yet, the special features were all I could handle at the time.  There are 5 deleted scenes that add up to about 2 minutes, so this was barely worth it, only because I love this movie so much.",2.0
"I'm a little ticked at LionsGate, I thought the shaky picture quality of the first wave of Blu-ray's was a thing of the past, now this. There is ""ringing"" and dirt in this transfer and I think given the limited number of Bluray titles out there, they ought to make a more concerted effort at keeping the quality higher than this. I guess I was expecting more, and reading the faint praise of the other two reviews, I see it's not just me.",2.0
"I am a huge Hitchcock fan but this one is a definite clunker.  Too many characters, too much meaningless dialog and really bland acting.  I can't imagine what he was thinking.  He really made some masterpieces, and I have all of those on DVD at my house. This is not one of them.",2.0
"I tried, I really did. In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack redeemed it, and I love 80s pop.  The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die.

I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end you just can't care. Live? Die? Whatever - just get to the bloody point already.

In the end, you'll feel exactly what the main character feels -- nothing.",2.0
"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

Made after Torn Curtain, Topaz is Hitchcock's return to the spy genre. However, the film fails to generate any real suspense, unlike his earlier films, which are masterpieces and the mostly abysmal Torn Curtain (which had at least one good sequence that had plenty of suspense in comparison to the rest of the movie). I liked John Forsythe (who would later play the unseen Charlie in Charlie's Angels), and Frederick Stafford was very good as Devereaux. The film was also much too long than it should have been, in my opinion. Could have had a better plot and a much better screenplay, though. In my opinion, Torn Curtain was the beginning of the end for The Master Of Suspense as far as suspenseful motion pictures were concerned...

In my opinion, Marnie was Hitchcock's last great movie.

Rated PG (mild language & violence and a brief love scene).",2.0
"Read no further, if you are concerned about ""spoilers""....

The IMDb explains that this film concerns ""Cold War politics,"" including parts ""leading up to the 1962 Cuban Missle Crisis.""  Being a Hitchcock fan, I'd been eager to see this film, after learning of at least one scene filmed in NYC.  Unfortunately, this film does NOT measure up to Hitchcock quality.  A review on the web site of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops describes it well:
* ""The dialogue is mostly banal and the action largely unconvincing, but there are occasional glimmers of the Hitchcock touch in subtle plot twists here and blind alleys there....Some physical and psychological violence and a lot of confusing intrigue.""",2.0

"This movie was such a disapointment. I thought it was going to be so voilent but it wasent. Only 2 murder scenes. There was more sex scences than murder scenes. The murder scenes didn't even show anything. In a later scene they show dead bodies all over the house but it never showed him killing them.

Christian Bale is naked alot in this movie. Which was the only reason to watch this movie. His acting as a psycho was scary though. The ending made no sense. It was like he fantasized the whole thing. Confusing. Horrible movie, big let down.",2.0
"I was so excited to watch this movie- well I wasn't impressed at all. The entire movie was predictable- and the fact that it was all in his head wasn't a very good ""twist"" at all. Besides Christian Bale, every other actor and actress was very annoying in this movie. In the end he goes on a killing spree that is more hilarious and over the top than shocking and horrifying like this movie wants you to think it is.

I think this movie could have been made much, much better- the killing scenes could have been more violent- the sexual scene in there I thought was totally unnecessary, the girls weren't even pretty. Although I do have to say the sex scene does get the point across how sadistic and disgusting Bale's character really is- and that is what basically is the only good thing about this movie- Christian's character and the way he plays it. The plot line is bad and needs to be redone or made better.",2.0
"I bought this film for a good price having heard alot about it and with the word psycho in the title, I just had to see it. The only good thing about this movie is the bloody killing scenes.

If you like the serial killer type movies, you might like this one but don't be prepared to be blown away!",2.0
"It became generally assumed after ""Torn Curtain"" and even more so after ""Topaz""  that the great Hitchcock had finally fallen victim to the march of time.  It turns out what he had actually fallen victim to were idiots at Universal Studios who insisted he hop on the ""evils-of-communism"" bandwagon.  The results turned out to be exactly what these meddlers deserved.  ""Topaz"" is, simply put, a misguided failure on just about every count.  Hitchcock loathed location filming, and this film required extensive location work.  Music had always been an integral part of the Hitchcock ""recipe"".  Since he had lost his favorite composer, Bernard Herrmann (again precipitated by studio meddling on ""Torn Curtain"") the score was composed by the fine Maurice Jarre who, unfortunately, just didn't seem able to fill Herrmann's shoes.  It is obvious in scene after scene that Hitchcock just didn't give a damn about this film.  And the lesson cost Universal over $4 Million, nearly five times as much as Hitch had spent on ""Psycho"" a few years earlier.

The fact that Hitchcock was still fully capable of making a good film was proven when he came roaring back some three years later with the remarkable ""Frenzy"" and, a couple of years later, with his valedictory, the lovely ""Family Plot"".

""Topaz"" is a slight blemish on a remarkable career.  Nothing more, nothing less.",2.0
"hitchcock didn't learn from torn curtain and tried another cold war tale with even worse results. this mess starts with an american and french spys tring to trace leak of info to the russians. the real proplem here is we expect so suspence or thrills from hitchcock and none are delivered and the movie just goes on forever. still some may like and hitchcock fans may even love it, but not me the master has and would do better",2.0

Pretending I have not read the book, I would still give the movie 2-3 stars, for the lack of good acting or pacing.",2.0
"The wooden Frederick Stafford is not the kind of  compelling , complex hero (like Cary Grant or James Stewart) of Hitchcock's  earlier films, and the film (which lasts 127 minutes) seems a conventional spy story except, perhaps, in calling attention to the pile of corpses of those who helped the hero.
Michel Piccoli is a conventional foil. Philippe Noiret is more interesting as a French NATO official, and John Vernon as a Cuban official. The Cubans are not demonized, though Karin Dor does explain her cooperation to him being because Castro has turned the island she loves into a prison.
The film jumps from Copenhagen to Washington to New York to Cuba to Paris. Many of the key scenes are filmed from a distance at which the viewer cannot hear what is said. If the visuals were more interesting, this might work, but as it is, it only makes the characters and their fates seem remote in interest.",2.0
"As much as I love the film, American Psycho, I can't help but feel cheated by this ""Uncut Killer Collector's Editoin."" There is only one minute, and I'm not exaggeration, of extra ""uncut"" footage. Not only that, but the footage is almost unnoticable. The only decent attributes of the DVD itself are the new deleted scenes, however there are only four. The rest of the speical features were junk, a TV special on the 80s, which I didn't care for, and a reading of an essay by some Blonde chic. Huge sell out if you ask me.",2.0

"American Psycho is kind of a dull movie.  Christian Bale's acting is occasionally interesting but the character of Patrick Batemen fails to gel.
The oft-cited satire is played in a ham-fisted manner and comes off more as the usual propaganda from the usual suspects then anything revealing or entertaining.
I felt the movie was overrated first, because of all the talk of violence when the film was released, and secondly because all the glowing user reviews.

"American Psycho is a dull, uninspired movie. A twenty-something upper-class white guy leads an empty, spiritually bankrupt life. Ho-hum. I've seen that motif in countless other movies, and American Psycho offers no new spin on the theme, save the fact that he gets his kicks out of mutilating and murdering people. In the end, the viewer discovers that none of the murders were even real, merely figments of a warped imagination.
It is, however, a mildly amusing movie, has some excellent photography, and Christian Bale does an ok job portraying the main character. But, like the vapid and soulless lifestyle it purports to criticize, American Psycho dances around the same tired and superficial images, content with just looking stylish without tackling anything substantial. It is a frustrating movie because it so desparately wants to be a biting satire, a work of art, and comes pretty close in a few scenes. But true satirical art must be fresh, original, and sustained, not merely stylish and half-hearted. N.B.: the opening credits montage is very well-done and clever, and worthwhile viewing on its own, if you have the will power to stop it once it's finished.",2.0
"Well, if the yuppies who are making thousand or millions of dollars are so stupid and so empty of character as the ones portrayed in this movie, uau, they must be geniuses for being so silly and still marking lots of money....

"American Psycho (Mary Herron, 2000)

Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho is the nadir of the eighties novel; it reads, roughly, like a three hundred page Sharper Image catalog, an endless listing of brand names and prices with nothing even remotely resembling a soul. When the film was released, the critics quickly came to the same conclusion about it. After a few months, however, better reviews of the film began to surface fromindependent critics and the like, calling it a
brilliant satire, wickedly funny, you know, that sort of thing. So I had to rent it. My constant repeating thought was ""it can't be as bad as the book.""

I was right. That's not saying much.

Christian Bale (who's going to be typecast as a sleazebag if he doesn't watch out) plays Patrick Bateman, a man whose obsession with fitting in to the fast-moving upperclass Wall Street society of his father manifests itself both as an obsession with the brand names of the things he utilizes in his daily routine and as an unstoppable compulsion to murder.

Herron, who's certainly no stranger to ultraviolence (she's directed episodes of Homicide and Oz, as well as the cult hit I Shot Andy Warhol), does manage to capture a certain beauty to Bateman's homicidal rage; there's a particular scene where Bateman is chasing a prostitute (Cara Seymour) down a hallway with a chainsaw that's almost hypnotic. Where the movie fails is in the spaces between. It's almost as if Ellis wrote the novel on a bet-- ""can you take a perfectly shallow character and center a whole book around him?"" The result, in both book and film, is painfully obvious; it can be done, but it's not that much fun to experience.

This makes it all the more painful that so many wonderful roles surface in this film, not least up-and-comer Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, a woman who stands out as the true beauty in a shallow world of glamour; Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) as Paul Allen, a business partner of Bateman's; Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's oblivious, apoiled fiancee; and Willem Dafoe, as usual, taking a minor role (a homicide detective) and turning it into something palpably creepy.

When all is said and done, there's just not enough good here to counteract the horrid. * 1/2",2.0
This movie is still entertaining after several years since it was made.  A good mystery/comedy with Bruce Dern doing a great job.  I totally recommend it.,2.0
"When I go to the movies, I can handle killings and murders. I can handle people going insane in their own minds, and people surrounding them suffering the consequences. That's not a shot to me; you've seen one death, the rest all seem like eye candy. What I don't like it killings and murders without a sensible plot. There has to be a motive, or a point ultimately made in the ending, that satisfies me well enough to have understood why the killer does what he or she does. Then, it's a good movie.
""American Psycho"" tried its best to fall into that category, though it succeeded only through its failure. The beginning of the movie was set up quite well, but from then on, all we get is the opinions and actions of a man so obsessed with himself that his motives are so petty and pointless. The movie tries so hard to be a satire of its characters, when in reality, it does nothing but give us a little more bloodshed and massacre than most other movies of this genre.
The movie follows the everyday proceedings of a successful businessman by the name of Patrick Bateman, a commodities broker who has an insatiable lust for murder and an extreme amount of disdain for all of those around him. This contempt he holds for everyone in his life, known or unknown, is the cause of his mental snaps, which leads him to commit one heinous act after another. And that's all the movie really is: his descent further and further as he begins killing more people and covering it up like nothing has happened. I can't go into details about the ending, so really, it's your choice as to whether or not it is a redeeming feature for the rest of the movie.
The only thing that I found admirable about the film is the fact that it is a no-holds-barred deal, and it seems as though it was made with no regard whatsoever about how the MPAA would deal with its extreme level of sexual and violent content. I admire a movie maker who can look society straight in the eye and basically say, ""Hey, this is a movie. Some of it actually does happen in real life. Start realizing it."" This is one of those movies, and for that, I give it credit.
However, I was vastly put off by Bateman's overly egotistical attitude towards everything in his life. It begins in a scene when he wakes up in the morning and takes a shower, and a voice over details everything that he does in regard to washing and cleaning his face, how many crunches he can do (""I can go up to 1,000 now.""), and his opinions on life in general. If they had left it at that with this scene, I would've been okay with it, but instead, it extends throughout the entire movie. Even during sex, he cannot help but look at himself in the mirror and flex his bicep. This is the ruinous feature of the film; there's just too much of it for me, and I'm sure others, to handle.
While the subject matter of the movie is not the greatest I've ever seen, the actors do a terrific job in their roles. Christian Bale is a standout as Patrick Bateman, and plays out the egotistical maniac role quite well. He is the film, basically. He is able to somewhat keep the movie together in certain places where it is needed.
The movie does not have a bad premise to it, but the attitudes and feelings of the characters throughout the film ruin it, so to speak. If they had concentrated more on the satirical nature of the plot, then it would be a far better success than what it really is: bland, and as emotionless as its main character.",2.0
"While I agree that Harron and Turner's adaptation of Ellis' dialogue and themes is masterful, the subsequent presentation borders on the mundane. The writing duo trim the 399 page novel down to a workable film length, but then add certain mindnumbing and distracting scenes which cripple the pacing of the film. In particular, the chainsaw sequence becomes a lengthy chase scene reminiscent of a film student aping Brian Depalma aping Hitchcock. Derivative scenes such as that not only mar the film's pacing, but move the film from dark satirical comedy to ludicrous farce. Maybe Harron was a better choice than Oliver Stone or those pushing for a ultra-violent version, but better is relative and should not be confused with excellence.",2.0
"Christian Bale stars in this adaption of Bret Easton Ellis' story of the same name.  The main purpose of this movie was to tell the tale of a ruthless serial killer that looked like an average guy.  It takes place during the 80's and just as in the book, the movie focuses on greed.  Money is an object that means nothing but can get you everything that you desire.  Drugs, clubbing, eating expensive food, and keeping yourself looking good.  All of these are the items that mean everything to the main character.  What was disturbing about this film was the killing.  It was done with a satire feel, which in itself was interesting and original, but was odd and made you think twice about what you were watching.  Bale does a fabulous job with the role, playing a serial killer/business man to the ""T"".  It was a good movie, you just have to keep an open  mind while watching it.",2.0
"American Pscyho is the most terrifying novel I have read. It gave me a very disturbing feeling that lasted more than a week. The film, on the other hand, fails to convey such a feeling. I don't know know why, but as i was watching the film,I thought it lacked that sharp and disturbing feeling.",2.0
"The only words that were coming to my mind while watching AMERICAN PSYCHO were "" Stop it ! It's too much "". Too much blood, too much satire, too much of everything. I haven't read the Bret Easton Ellis novel but what is certain is that literature allows a lot of liberties cinema simply can not translate in images unless you are Jean-Luc Godard or Orson Welles.
AMERICAN PSYCHO tries to describe a peculiar world, the world of the 1980 New-York yuppies. These yuppies are very snob without the cultural background found in, let's say for instance, the englishmen of the first part of the XXth century. They are like empty shells, living a life of fast money, expensive restaurants and uninteresting social activities. Well, they don't particularly bother me as long as they stay in their artificial world. And I can easily imagine to what kind of excess easy money can drive a man who has not a solid moral history.
If I have understood well the purpose of the authors of AMERICAN PSYCHO, the movie, apart of this harsch critique of the yuppie world, would like to convince us that money and power could eventually lead someone to believe that he can be a new god, deciding who has the right to live and who should die, without being worried by consequences. Patrick Bateman, after a slow start, becomes less and less prudent and finally commit murders in the open light. Like the serial killers he admires, he wants unconsciously to be recognized. The movie often hesitates between the satire, the not so fairy tale, the horror and the moral genre, so feel free to have your own opinion about it.

"They sure changed the flavor of the book that I read! Instead of making the book into a movie .. they made a movie from some highschool girls book report about the book. Being in high school she either .. A) didn't really read the book and only wrote her report about a few chapters or portions of chapters  B) had to leave out the sexy, gruesome stuff or parents and teachers would get upset  OR  C)  Didn't understand any of it so she wrote her book report about only the simplest parts that she did understand. This is what happens when a story that couldn't and probably shouldn't have been made into a movie - gets turned over to a production company that only wants to use the notoriety of the title to sell tickets. Once you are in the theater they can show you any story as long as the names of the characters are unchanged from the book, the locale and key catch lines and phrases remain. Although the acting performances were excellent when judged on their own merit .. American Psycho was so totally sanitized that it came out looking like ""The Shining Does Wall Street"" with an ending plucked straight out of the ""Dallas"" TV night time soap!  Patrick Bateman/Bobby Ewing really didn't do any of those things .. only in his mind/dream. The NOVEL left you UNDECIDED as to the reality of the deeds .. this MOVIE softens the whole thing and all but superimpose an ""IMAGINARY KILLER"" caption over Bateman's headshot at the end. This film should have been called ""AMERICAN PSYCHO LITE"". I realize how distateful the book was but why turn it into a Saturday matinee? I'd much rather they had not made the movie at all than to have to soak it in so much estrogen that it was drained of all its energy. Director Harron should find some windows to wash or cookies to bake ... where are Wes Craven and David Cronenberg when you really need them? If you have not read the book, watch the movie.

"Poor ol' Hitch.  He didn't go out with a bang.  I was looking forward to this film so much, considering it was his last film.  I thought it would be interesting to see how his style would hold up in 1976 compared to his prime of the 40's, 50's, and early 60's.  Even Frenzy from 72 was a far superior film, actually one of my favorites.  But I must say I was highly disappointed in this pitiful film.  The only good part was the down the hill in the car scene.  And Barbara Harris is pretty entertaining lady.  Other than that, it was quite hideous.  ""Frenzy"" should have been his last flick for sure.  The question is, ""Is it a comedy or suspense?""  Well, unfortunately, neither, because it's not funny, suspenseful, or even interesting at all.  No disrepect though because he is still one of the greatest directors ever.....",2.0
"Hitchcock was one of those rare directors I could buy any DVD at the store, without even seeing the film first, and KNOW it was going to be a worthwhile purchase.  Sadly, Family Plot has broken that.

Aside from the opening title sequence, it does not feel at all like a Hitchcock film, but rather a run of the mill talking head detective mystery of the 70s, with rather bland/dry acting.  There is little of the Hitch suspense throughout, aside from a decent ending, it's fairly conventional and doesn't really scream Hitch at all - and in fact at times, feels more like a TV movie.

Frankly I'd say this is a rental only and I'd save the cash for any of the other 60 films Hitch made.  Transfer was a bit subpar as many of the blacks are washed out, which is odd since the film is not that old.",2.0
"It's hard to believe that this is an Alfred Hitchcock film. If this is any indication, Hitch was beginning to lose it at the end of his life, and bowed out just in time.

Even Hitchcock couldn't save a bad script, which is 90% of the problem - his quality control seems to have been totally shot when he read it and thought it was a good idea. It's not so much the structure of the plot -- Hitch could have easily worked within its comedy/drama/mystery setup. Plot holes abound (for example, a jeweler's home with ZERO burglar alarms?), but these could have been tightened up with a few script revisions.

However, the dialogue and characterizations are simply atrocious. The dialogue has way too many profanities and little of the wit, style and real humor of most of Hitchcock's classic scripts. The two ""heroes"" are totally unappealing, and the acting doesn't help. Barbara Harris' Blanche is supposed to be ditzy and cute, but her performance makes her shrill and stupid. George, played by Bruce Dern, comes across as a boorish, vulgar jerk. It's hard for them to establish any romantic chemistry when they spend most of their time bickering.
On the other hand, William Devane and Karen Black, as the villains, come off as wooden and lifeless . My wife was rooting for all four of them to buy the farm at the end!

Hitchcock's direction is uninspired. There is one interesting shot (the graveyard sequence) but, at best, we've seen it before (the out of control car). The film looks like a tacky 70's TV movie or a poor episode of ""McMillan and Wife"", rather than a film from one of history's great directors. And the ending, to say the least, is anticlimactic and dumb.

This one is only for Hitchcock completists and those who want to see every one of his films, like my wife and me. But do NOT let this be your first Hitchcock movie, or you might never want to see another. Go for ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"", ""Strangers of a Train"" or ""North By Northwest"" instead.",2.0
"Sorry, but I have to agree with a previous reviewer who noted the ""sterileness"" of this movie.  The author portrayed his role in such a cold, unfeeling way that I couldn't get into the movie.  And I don't mean the kind of ""coldness"" that a crazy killer is presumed to feel.  I just mean the acting itself didn't raise any emotions out of me other than embarrassment that I was watching it.  The movie appeared to be just a way to get some ""hacking and slashing"" on the screen under the guise of a ""good"" movie.  It fell short for me.",2.0

In a way I'm surprised, positively. 'Cause the film has some good ideas, some good parts. Like the visualization of Patrick Bateman's apartment, or his anger caused by pure jealousy and unfulfilledness.
But all in all, it is not a very good film. The story is reduced to nearly nothing. Some unnecessary (and very poorly done) stuff, like the killing of some policemen, is added which is very annoying to the whole concept. And although Christian Bale starts out well and is well-chosen for the role, he somehow gets too nervous in the long run.

There was no plot, and  when you think you have a chance of figuring out what is going on, the end  comes, and you have no idea of what just happened.

A depressingly formulaic and unappealing movie in which the main character must decide romantically between a suit-wearing bigshot and a soulful poet-writing ne'er do well (guess which one she chooses), Reality Bites should be of interest only to those who want to steep themselves in mid-90's nostalgia.",2.0
"No, this film bites!  Has there ever been another film where the main characters are so unlikable?  Winona Ryder is supposed to be the valedictorian of her class, and her acquaintance Ethan Hawke is routinely described as having a ""high IQ"" - yet they are both lazy, criminally inclined and, well, unlikable.  Ben Stiller plays a buffoon executive who is so inarticulate as to invite audience scorn.

Nor are the situations plausible.  Ryder, the ""valedictorian,"" forgets the final pages of her speech and can't perform simple arithmetic after 3 attempts.  (???)  Later, at work she whines, ""I only make $300 dollars a WEEK!!!""  If the producers had done any research into a typical valedictorian, they might have found out that most get there by hard work and discipline, can actually perform simple math, and have decent starter jobs lined up far in advance of graduation.

But ignoring that for the moment, you still have to wonder why the producers were so off-base on Gen-Xers, presumably their target audience.  If they had bothered to check, they would have found tons of minimum wage earners (which, at the time the movie came out, was LESS than $200 per week!), kids sharing housing with 10-15 friends to make ends meet, second hand cars or no cars at all, no health insurance, or living with mom just to survive etc. - and most of them not going ballistic about it either.  But instead, we have Winona in a professional job atmosphere - no hedge trimming or dish washing here - making a reasonable starter wage, which we are supposed to believe is unbearable.  Apparently since Hollywood types have a tough time making it on $1,000,000+ per year, they figure only the homeless earn $300 per week.

So, Ryder, up to her armpits in ""angst,"" embarrasses the guy she's working for on national TV and gets fired.  She then sits around in her apartment aimlessly, calls the psychic hotline and steals hundreds of dollars from her father.  Yes, this is your valedictorian displaying the work habits that got her to the top of her class.

Ethan Hawke is lazy, criminally inclined, and irritating.  So, naturally Ryder falls for him.  That, I guess, is the only redeemable point in the movie.  When viewers want to know ""how on EARTH could SHE take up with HIM??"" the answer is, correctly, ""hey, reality bites.""

It's too bad to see talented actors wasted in a film like this, because they deserve better.",2.0
"Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of ""X"" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.

It was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass, cruel arena of materialism can be tough, providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies.  Instead we have a swan dive into a Pizza Hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930.

Winona Ryder is winning as Lelaina, but one can only imagine the SATs of football players at a college where she is valedictorian.  Her ""documentary"" is appallingly narcissistic, reflecting the characteristic Gen X notion that - ""if it's about me, it's art, and it's important.""  Ethan Hawke does an excellent job as Troy, the very archetype of self-satisfied, supercilious entitlement.  We are expected to root for him, but it's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus.

Stiller, who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays Michael, the ""anti-Troy.""  Smooth, successful, and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of Gen X culture - if culture is the right word - he's an executive at an MTV-ish corporation.  That he improves Lelaina's preposterous ""documentary,"" rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity, is the film's dirty little secret.

Viewers surprised by who wins Lelaina's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and Liberace was gay.  Indeed, when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie.  Janeane Garofalo is outstanding as always, and John Mahoney shines as the TV morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact, a bastard.  His performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on TV - than the rest of this film put together.

In fact, reality is great, this picture would have benefited from some.",2.0
"Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the ""hero"" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves ""ironic"", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.  Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays.

You know the type--they shop in independant record stores, wear Docs and Birkenstocks, use Salinger and TS Eliot quotes as the ""witty conversation"" portion of a date, and think being seen holding a double mocha latte will make you seem intelligent.

"I had finaly seen ""The Changeling"" after reading some good stuff about it. Haunted houses are always fascinating because the interiors in which the characters move are always ambivalent: doors can protect as well as they can lock up. Long hallways give you a chance to run as much as they can trap you in their labyrinthian web. In the worst case scenario's, the house itself can be possessed and become a character of its own.

Furthermore there is the underlying story which is allways intrigueing: who or what is the spirit that disturbes the piece, why is it doing the nasty things it does, what is its own secret past and what can the characters do to lay it to its final rest. From ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Shining"", from ""Haunted"" and ""The Haunting"" all the way to variations on the subject like ""Ghost ship"" and ""Below"" (A haunted house drifting on or somewhere in the open sea).

In ""The Changeling"" George C. Scott enters a abandoned house after a tragic accident which killed his wife and kid. He is a musician and the house has a wonderul room for him to play the piano and compose new material. To earn a living he teaches at the local university. But soon things happen in the old house. Noisy pounding sounds, a piano key that is struck without a finger is being seen... Soon Scott starts to look into the house's own private history and stumbles upon a family tragedy.

I shall not go into this history myself and not only because there would be spoilers. I won't do it because it isn't really relevant here. Because way before the plot really unfolds I found myself being irritated by the lack of ""good work"" on behalf of the director.

The pounding sounds Scott hears are so loud that they literaly break through the tension, the sounds are almost like a spoiler of their own. Furthermore, because of this ear shattering volume it's impossible to figure out whether the pounding sounds come from the house (and are part of the story) or that they are the results of an all too experimenting movie composer who wants to fill the soundtrack with abstract noises, rather then conventional music.

O, but wait, there is a lot of conventional music in this film; but it is too much really. Whenever something scary or unusual tends to happen, director Peter Medak apparently didn't want anyone to miss the message that the scene was about to be scary or unusual: so when a child's toy, a little ball, mysteriously falls down the stairs, the full string orchestra burst out with `scary howling manic violins and the likes' so indeed no one could fail to understand that what is going on with that mysterious ball is in fact scary and unusual.

Also the camera is a usueful means to underline the fact that something scary or unusual is going on. When Scott leaves the room in oone scene, a piano key is touched by an invisible finger. To be sure that no one would miss it, Medak lets the camera zoom in with furious intend. Leaving the sole key within the frame and the rest of the piano strategicly outside, Medak ensures himself that indeed we won't miss that scary and unsusual moment.

And so on. And so on. No mood, no real eerie creepy scenes, just a lot of unnecessary bombast and just the trustful face of George C. Scott to hang on to.

One thing is remarkeble however: two elements in this movie: a horrible drowning scene involving a little child and a well from which the child's skeleton later is excavated have returned years later in two critically acclaimed and rather successful Japanese horror movies: ""Dark water"" which has an appartment block haunted by the spirit of a drowned child and ""Ring"" (or ""Ringu"") which has the terrifying well in which the skeletonized body of another child is hidden.

These two movies know how to scare the audience and keep them captivated with an eerie feeling throughout. Both have a strong tension that builds up and never lets go. And both have excellent use of locations, be it this time modern day menacing concrete appartment blocks in stead of big old cosy Victorian houses.

So, in the end, this movie may have been of some use after all.",2.0

Where the director miss the point is when a scene become to bring some creepy tension  ... it suddenly cut and jump in time to a boring ordinary scene instead of extending it. All these abrupt cuts ruins entirely all the atmosphere and put the movie to the rank of 'only for the story suspense' instead of real horror film.

"The movie is OK, I suppose, if you read the book and want to now watch some images to go along with that book.  And that is the crux of my criticism; given the dated production, one can only watch this movie and not partake in it.

More specifically, compared to today's productions of Austen, Dickens, etc. from the BBC and elsewhere, this production is rather bland.

The lines are delivered as if they were being read, passion is reserved to the level that one wonders if it exists that all.  There is no heated exchange, no believable human interaction, the scenes are devoid of the dirt and chaos of reality.

In total, compared to today's productions, there is no ""suspension of disbelief"".

The best I can say about this production is perhaps it would have gotten four stars back in 1980 when he was released.

For now, I'll keep it on a shelf while I live the most recent realistic renditions of Austin, Dickens, and the other classics.

"It wasn't what I expected when I got this movie on Blu Ray. Because of the fact that there's lots of greenery in this movie, it doesn't mesh very well. Case in point would be the ravine where they were chasing Rambo with the helicopter. The brush was literally blurred as the camera panned thru the valley. Most of the action as the sheriff posse ran thru the forest was blurred also. Yes, my motion settings were set just fine. In fact, I tried adjusting it on the fly and it didn't help. My other Blu Ray's look really good. This one did not... which is disappointing because this was a great movie.",2.0

But seriously, the director knows how to keep a story moving and Stallone's sympathetic (if over-acted) performance helps but when his character says ""let it go, or I'll give you a war you won't believe"", THE END should have come up on the screen. A nice little 45 minute movie ending satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the film goes on and a man in a grey overcoat and silly beret shows up with a pair of water skis and a rubber shark. This toe curlingly cheesy performance ends with one of the most embarrassing moments in film history. ""Don't do it, Rambo!"" Yells the afore-mentioned Colonel.

"I watched this particular program when I was a small child, and I had great recollections about it, but thirty years can make a big difference. What I expected was a heartwarming, well produced, Christmas special. What  I got was poor, early attempts at blue screen special effects that were  distracting, and poorly executed (the scene where the shepherd boy enters  the gates of Heaven is especially groan worthy). The people who reissued  this video should have also restored color and sound. Time has made a crisp  picture, and bright colors, look faded. Everyone and everything comes out  looking slightly pink or green.  The story is, at 77 minutes  long, about an hour too long. Several of the songs could have been cut  without making a hole in the plot. Still, the story does have a good moral,  and Tony Randall, Cab Calloway, and Fred Gwynne (when he's not mugging too  much ala Herman Munster) give fine, noteworthy performances.  I recommend this clumsy production for the people  who love productions from a time gone by.

"This little television nugget premiered in 1969 on television for one showing only. The show was intended to be an uplifting tale of angels and Heaven. Instead, this pre-teen targeted program scared the bejesus out of the kids by showing them that children die horrifying deaths and are unable to ever speak or hear from their parents again. Apparently, even in those non-PC times parents were horrified by this show to such a degree that they called and complained in droves. To my knowledge it never aired again.

I was seven when this program premiered and I had been through the ordeal of my little sister's death from cancer. I had been through the death of other family members. This program was cold comfort. It traumatized me and I am still affected by it in a very negative way.

Little Michael (Johnny Whitaker) chases a dove sent from God, only to run right off a cliff and die. The angels allow him to return home to retrieve a treasured keepsake but he is unable to speak to his parents and they are unable to see or hear him.

I don't know how this figured as holiday/Christmas fare, but it was presented around Christmas time. I know it has stuck in my mind all these thirty plus years later and not in a good way. I have always found myself worrying about the death of relatives and I'm convinced this film has added to some of that stress.

"I disagree strongly with director and writer David Koepp's belief that he was successful in depicting true-to-life working-class characters from Chicago in ""Stir of Echoes"". There is something very unlikeable and unrealistic about most of the characters in this film. The thing that bothers me the most is the foul language. When Kathyrn Erbe (who plays the wife, Maggie) confronts Tom (played by Kevin Bacon), she crudely confronts him over his vision of a woman who's been haunting their house; she blurts out, ""Did you f--k her?"" Not only does this unsubtle, heavy-handed type of dialogue crop up way too often during the film (and spoken by too many of the characters), it also makes the characters wholly unsympathetic. Don't any of them have any wit or a sense of humor or are they all crude boors who like to get into arguments with one another?

Koepp based 'Stir of Echoes' on a 1958 tale by Richard Matheson (of Twilight Zone fame). The inciting incident, where Tom is hypnotized and begins seeing visions seems quite dated. Hypnosis might have been a big thing for a movie audience in 1958 but by the late 90s it's old hat! I would have liked to have seen something a little more clever and original to propel Tom into his supernatural world.

Many of the characters' actions in this film are way too over the top. I didn't quite believe that the babysitter would kidnap Jake simply because she heard him talking about her missing sister. Most normal teenagers would have calmly told their parents about their suspicions and the parents could have then contacted the police to investigate. Perhaps the most unbelievable part of the film is Maggie's reaction to Tom's obsessions. She visits her friend the hypnotist who advises her to ""get help"" for Tom; but she never follows through. She decides to do everything on her own. Even if you believe that she never notices anything peculiar about her child's behavior (especially Jake telling her to hire the babysitter), she totally ignores everything the psychic cop tells her (spelling it out that her husband has partial psychic powers and the son is fully psychic). She goes home and ends up having another argument with Tom over his visions. It's just too unbelievable that she continues to believe Tom is out of his mind.

Koepp implies that Maggie fears humiliation from her working class friends if word gets out that Tom has lost his marbles and that's why she gains no insight into what's going on. I don't really buy it given all the clues put in front of her but even if one accepts Koepp's scenario, a real person probably would have gone for some outside help.

Koepp settles for some over the top banter between husband and wife with Tom insisting that Maggie has been trying to stop him from discovering ""the most important thing in my life"". In the silliest scene in the movie, Kevin Bacon, sounding like someone who forgot to take his medication, repeats ""I won't stop"" three times as Maggie tries to get him to stop digging up the body. Koepp needs a device to get Maggie out of the house so Tom is left alone for the killers to appear and try and do him in. So out of the blue, Maggie's mother dies and she takes Jake and leaves the house.

Even way before the resolution where the bad guys are dispatched, it seems pretty obvious that a bunch of locals killed the missing girl so I didn't find the film's denouement very gripping. There are a few scenes in ""Stir of Echoes"" that are too drawn out. Koepp could have cut about 10 minutes from the exposition before the hypnosis scene. The same goes for all the digging Kevin Bacon was doing at the end.

Koepp has certainly made a name for himself in Hollywood, penning the the two Spielberg films, 'War of the Worlds' and 'Indiana Jones', which showed a marked improvement over the insufferable ""Spiderman"". Now that he is a prime player in Hollywood, perhaps he might consider tackling subject matter that is intellectually on a higher plane.

Certainly 'Stir of Echoes', his earlier effort, will never enter the pantheon of memorable films in the future.",2.0

"""Stir of Echoes,"" updated from an old novel by Richard Matheson, came out in 1999 soon after the huge hit ""The Sixth Sense."" Whether intentionally or not, the two films resemble each other enormously: the restless dead communicate with a little boy, and an adult is drawn into that communication. ""The Sixth Sense"" (the only truly good thing by director M. Night Shyamalan) is more moody, inventive, and compelling (if a little self-important, like Shyamalan himself); it obviously hit a nerve with audiences and critics. Needless to say, it eclipsed ""Stir of Echoes,"" a decent film but one that treads too well-worn territory. Somehow, the ordinary setting is *too* ordinary. I really didn't care about the dull lives of the characters; they were unappealingly presented. Neither did I care about the ghost, though her victimization in life gave me the same feeling of anger when I hear news items about similar violence against women. The acting is professional but uninspired. It's probably Kevin Bacon's best work, but frankly, that's not saying much. He generally delivers his lines in an uninflected monotone and is stiff throughout; and while Bruce Willis was almost as wooden in ""The Sixth Sense,"" Haley Joel Osment's performance as the prescient child was so overwhelming and expressive that Willis hardly mattered. Here, the kid (played by Zachary David Cope) is almost window dressing so Bacon's dull performance has no help. The direction, by the screenwriter, is unobtrusive at least but it constantly borrows images from other films, often very irritating. Worth a look, but you probably won't want to go back for a second viewing. The extras are plentiful but unbelievably uninteresting. They are presented to look like the analogous features on the DVDs of ""The Ring"" and ""The Sixth Sense."" The distributor, Lions Gate, seemed to think so little of this film's marketability that they felt it necessary to connect it with two more successful--and original--supernatural thrillers of the period by imitating the DVD presentation.",2.0

I purchased this video after reading reviews from other buyers.  I was not as impressed as they were.  Denise and the two backup workout people often become out of sync during the video - so you really need to pick one person and stick with them rather than watching anyone else or it throws you off.  The cues are not timed very well so I had to watch the video more than once in order to keep up.  The music did nothing for me.  I agree that I ended up with a good workout.  I was sweating at the end and I am sure I burned calories - but it is not going to be my favorite workout.

"Stir of Echoes
Score: 41/100
People had been talking about Stir of Echoes around New Zealand, saying it was 10 times scarier than The Sixth Sense and it was very well commercialised. But, Stir of Echoes borrows so heavily from The Sixth Sense that it might as well have been titled The Seventh Sense, and it is a huge disappointment.
Tom (Kevin Bacon) is a regular guy, a utilities lineman, married, with a young son, his wife is pregnant; he hangs out with long-time pals in a Chicago neighborhood. At a party, his sister-in-law hypnotizes him, and he goes into a deep trance. Before waking him, she suggests that he keep his mind open. That night he sees flashes of violence and the ghost of a young woman. His young son, too, is ""a receiver,"" but while the boy is calm and coherent in his conversations with spirits, Tom is confused and agitated. Over time, the young woman's story comes to the surface, and Tom begins a hunt for her body that puts him and his usually understanding wife, Maggie (Katherine Erbe), in grave danger.
Stir of Echoes does not only take scenes from The Sixth Sense, it uses The Shining's story, man-goes-crazy-and-freaks-family-out, and it basically insults the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. Most of the performances are laughable, especially Kevin Bacon and Zachary David Cope in a stupidly over-blown chemistry, but, Katherine Erbe manages to an okay heroine, though she does not put nearly enough effort in to save this film. The easy way to say it is this film is predictable, annoying and boring, and does not deserve the critical-acclaim and large audience it got.
The finale is entertaining and neatly done, but, guess what! It uses exactly the same techniques as The Green Mile did! God, it's becoming uncountable how many movies this borrows from. Stir of Echoes is a passable and mostly lame horror film that always tries to score, and never earns many points.",2.0
"Sure, Stir of Echoes got the shaft because it was released around the same time as the Sixth Sense. However, the very notion that this film was great and would have been a box office smash if not for that unfortunate coincedence.. Well, that's really quite scary.
Granted, some parts were ok, at times even good, but there were a number of distractions. Kevin Bacon's son wasn't exactly easy on the eyes (I hope I don't have to elaborate this, because I don't want to offend anyone). It was also sort of surreal how he (the son) always commented on the dead people around them as if, ""hey, everything is going to be ok"". It's interesting for one person in a movie to be able to see dead people. Several people.. no. Especially if some small child is completely ok with it, and the father is going batty.
The son didn't even play any sort of purpose in the whole film. He just sort of screwed everything up. Kevin Bacon was definitely shortchanged here, as his performance would have seemed a lot better if not for the kid. Why drag the focus off of how frightening and mysterious it is? I swear I hated the presence of that kid in the movie long before the credits rolled by.
Also, the ending was, well, way too predictable. In a psychological thriller, I want to be surprised. I don't want to be yawning, looking at my watch, or looking for the bathroom because I could care less. See? No comparisons to that ""other movie"", though I'm sure you could make some yourself. This ""film"" is just horrible, thanks to a few mindless screw-ups.",2.0
"The Sixth Sense caused a stir with its twisting plotlines and the occasional trip to visit with the dead. This DVD is a little different in  the approach but the formulaic plotline endures.
Kevin Bacon is a Chicago  husband trying to provide for his family, a son and wife, with an accent  that sounds more Bronx than Chi-town. Okay. But why the guitar and  references to his band? It doesnt help the story and it doesn't develop the  character.
Anyhow, he gets hypnotized at a party and begins to have  visions (yeah...not the Fatima type, but of dead, missing children). And  that sets off an addiction (seriously) for Orange Juice. His son communes  with the dead as well...why not?
Nice neighborhood. Seems like two jocks  killed a retarded girl (why she had to be mentally retarded I'm not sure),  and the parents cover up her accidental death by sealing her in a basement  wall (Poe anyone?). You guessed it...the basement is in Bacons home and he  is obsessed with finding the body.

"Unfortunately, this film does not do justice to life and times of Charlie Chaplin. Most of what makes his life truly inspiring is not on here (except for a short little detail or two, like that lunch with Hoover). To make it all even worse, just as one gets into it, the story is interrupted by a present-time conversation between Chaplin and his biographer, which in reality never happened. Why bring an unnecessary gimmick to the film, as if Chaplin's life did not have enough twists and turns to keeps us interested? Beats me.
Robert Downey Jr. was perfect, and that's the only reason I give it two stars. Otherwise, those who truly know Chaplin's life, and appreciate his genius, will be disappointed as this film manages to skip all the glory, and focuses on boring details. How do you turn one of the most exciting careers into such a bore is beyond me. Chaplin deserves much better than that.",2.0

Watch ""The Buster Keaton Story"" and you'll see the same thing: actual elements from a life well-documented that have nothing to do with reality or blended facts to create something they believed was more interesting and watchable. My thinking is, why would you invest money in falsification? What will they do to Paul McCartney after he is deceased and unable to defend himself from these blended fabrications? I had great respect for Mr. Attenborough before this film was made - I lost it after viewing this film. But as a Chaplin purist, these things bother me - as a film lover, the movie itself is very entertaining - I only wish Mr. A had stuck to the facts as there is NO reason to re-invent the Master. In addition, I should say that the score (by the late John Barry) is absolutely perfect for the scenes and reflects Chaplin's mixture of comedy and pathos, which is, of course, why Chaplin's comedies are high above all others as they truly reflect the human condition and not just for laughs.",2.0
"The great failure of this film is not its acting, that is obvious from the talent assembled. It is not in the props. The props are absolutely perfect in authenticity. What sinks the film is the screenplay, Downey's one-dimentional depiction of Chaplin, and a director too clueless to notice what these were doing to his picture. According to his leading ladies, Chaplin was only depressed and brooding when he was creatively blocked. In Chaplin he is depicted as always depressed. There isn't one montage to show him as the directorial dirvige he was described as being by those who knew him. Instead of directing Downey out of this emotional rut, he plods along through Chaplin's life like a man walking from fencepost to fencepost.

"Every film requires some suspension of disbelief, but there is a limit before ""interesting"" verges on ""campy."" The concept of Rekall, where artificial memories of a vacation are implanted, is interesting enough to merit its own movie, as the opposite idea did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eternal-Sunshine-of-the-Spotless-Mind/dp/B001TAJGO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>. Instead of erasing the memory of unpleasant events, people would submit to the addition of fake memories of pleasant events. This could lead to philosophical musings on the nature of the self, the stream of consciousness, and whether this makes a difference - if it matters whether a memory is of a ""real"" event or an artificial one, if it's impossible to tell the difference.

Instead, this is just an introduction for an extended chase, shoot-em-up spy thriller. There are some great special effects for the time - Schwarzenegger removing a golf ball-sized tracking device from his nose, a costume head that forms horizontal slices as it comes apart, the clear outline of a gun against a skeleton on a spaceport monitor. In this future world, the trip from earth to Mars is so routine as to need not a single frame; we go straight from one planet to the other with no intervening travel time, not even one shot of the inside of a spaceship. Once on Mars, the chase is on, in a world ruled by a dictator who turns people into mutants by denying them sufficient air and protection from radiation.

Mel Johnson, Jr.'s character seems to start off as a ""magical negro,"" however, he quickly morphs into a shuckin'-and-jivin' clown before finishing as a treasonous villain. A vicious martial-arts battle between the lovely Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin was groundbreaking for the time - two hot chicks fighting! It's almost as good as lesbian porn. The ending trumps everything that came before it, however - we are asked to believe that the sudden development of an atmosphere would not result in cataclysmic storms; it's no more violent than the effect of putting on a scuba mask.

I am disappointed with the image quality of this release. Sometimes the video is beautiful, but sometimes it's too grainy and I can't accept it. This movie is not old enough and deserves more attention from the industry, which hasn't been showing respect with Blu-ray consumers.",2.0
"Wow. I did not remember this movie being this cheesy. Just saw the new version with Colin Farrell which I totally enjoyed, so I wanted to see how the original compared. Nice to see that some remakes are an improvement on previous versions. I remember enjoying the Schwarzenegger version when it was out, but that was a long time and many great technological advances ago. Still love the full-body scanner scene in this one! I remember is being quite the thing to see back then and I still get a kick out of watching the skeletal images walking thru the scanner.",2.0
"I'm a huge fan of the movie, but the digital copy, like a lot of other digital media offered by amazon has sound issues.  The volume can't be made loud enough to be played on certain media, like my xbox or kindle fire.  It's all there, but for my xbox I need to have the volume on my TV at 99, and I still can't hear some things if there's any other background noise in my apartment, even a ceiling fan.  The problem with the kindle fire can be reduced by putting in my headphones and blasting it to full volume, but without them I have the same problem.  Also it would be nice if there was an option for subtitles.",2.0

"I really for some reason did not like this movie.  Found it kind of boring and just really could not connect with it or the story just did not seem to make sense.

"I am writing mainly for those considering purchasing this blu-ray edition of Total Recall. Don't ; save your money. It is the worst transfer I have seen so far. The picture is constantly grainy and ruins what is otherwise a fine film. It is just outrageous that they would market a film in blu-ray in such poor condition. That accounts for the two stars, which otherwise would have been at least four for the film itself. It still holds up very well after twenty years, is superbly paced with nonstop action, and great effects for its time. Unfortunately my laser disc version of this film is better quality than the blu-ray.  This is totally unacceptable.",2.0
"Total Recall had its controversy in its heyday.  Known for its violent scenes and fast paced action sequences, it was a favorite movie of mine when it first entered the theater.  It was an interesting blend of science fiction, action, and some suspense mixed in together.  One left the movie with many questions that are still being pondered to this day.  That said, the Blu Ray version is a bit of let down.

The film quality of the Blu Ray version is sub par at best, with artifacts and some noise. My Blu Ray player up scales dvd movies with better picture quality than this transfer.  I ended up having to change my picture settings to get a less noisy picture.  This version was a real downer since high definition should look better than high quality dvd transfers. While the $10 price tag (or around this price range) is attractive, if one has a previous DVD version then one should really wait for a better edition on Blu Ray.

On a side note:
This Blu Ray version of Total Recall really shows the need for accurate reviews of Blu Ray movies (instead of dvd versions).  Not all Blu Rays have good picture and sound quality and some are outright poor in these two areas. I would advise anyone to check out reviews, especially those that detail the picture quality, of prospective Blu Ray movie purchases.",2.0
"Everyone knows this is an awesome movie... but the blu-ray has nothing BUT the movie! No director/actor commentary, no deleted scenes, NOTHING! Whoevers idea that was should be fired.",2.0
"I purchased this Blu Ray as one of my first with my player. I turned it on and thought it was the cable or something was set up incorrectly. The brightness in some parts of the screen goes up an down with a white grain - The horse in the beginning looking like she is running in a rain storm. After spending 2 hours trying to fix the new player I tried a different Blu-Ray disc and was incredible.

We tested the HD DVD version of Total Recall and the conversion is like Terminator 2 from the UK that is flawless like a jaw dropping movie effects show where special care was given to the grain in addition to remaster to highlight the shows performance. I am very disappointed with the Blu Ray version. I hope they read this and will fix for future presses as people deserve more like the HD DVD version. This one deserves to be at the dollar store.",2.0
"Total Recall is certainly imaginative. I've seen it twice now, and I STILL don't understand it. I think you could watch this film a few times, and still have questions that you needed answered. But it plays with your mind, and leaves you racking your brains, wondering if what you just saw actually happened.

In my opinion, this is not Arnie's best movie. Maybe it's the character I'm not sure. And normally I love Arnie in movies. Just didn't get this one. Mind you, I don't often understand films that are based on Philip K Dick stories - does anybody? This is based on 'We'll Remember It For You Wholesale'.

Arnie plays Doug Quaid, a construction worker, who's bored with his uneventful life, but not with his nymphomaniac wife (Sharon Stone). For some reason, he's fascinated by Mars, to the extent of dreaming about it. Dreaming that he's there, with another woman. There's a way he can get a 'vacation' implanted into his memory, and with a bunch of extras - like being a secret agent for example.

Once unconscious, Quaid wakes up in a rage, claiming he's no Quaid, but a man called Hauser. (Anne of Green Gables fans, watch out in these scenes, for a character called Doctor Lull, who was played by Rosemary Dunsmore, who played Katherine Brooke in the Anne Of Green Gables sequel.) But the technicians haven't even begun to implant the vacation yet. Blacking out again, and waking up some time later, he's confused. His once loving wife is out to kill him, as well as his colleagues, and he has some unfinished business on Mars. Despite the fact he's never been there you understand.

It's from here that the film skews into a totally different plot and left me completed puzzled. A later scene involves Doctor Edgemar coming into the so called vacation to tell Quaid/Hauser that he's had a schizoid embolism back in the chair when he was getting the implant. This is quite possibly the point where I definitely started to lose the thread of the film - as well as being confused about whether Quaid was Hauser, or Hauser was Quaid, something happens in this scene (I won't give it away) which completely confused me.

In a way, it's good because it leaves the viewer to decide what actually happens. The viewer can decide whether or not the film is a dream, or a reality, whether Quaid gets lobotomised or not, whether Quaid is Quaid or Hauser etc. But for simple minds like mine, it's left totally bamboozled.

Whereas I did enjoy what I could understand of the movie, the reason I'm giving it a low rating, is because it's simply not my favourite Arnie movie.

The movie transfers well onto blu ray, and some additional scenes (more footage of Mars for example) would have looked amazing in high definition.",2.0
"I recived this blu ray version of Total Recall from amazon. To be honest my opinion... it's not worth it to watch with blu ray or pay more than DVD. Graphic isn't change as DVD or DVD is maybe much better graphic I think.

"""Inspired"" by the short story of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick, ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,"" this movie starts off as a mysterious, intellectual, and action packed thriller, up until the line ""Conseeder zis a divohse!""
And then we go down from there.
To its credit, it stays true all the way until Quaid battles his wife. While the story involves more and more possible true/implanted memories in Quaid while he strikes deals with the powerful government, the movie quickly goes to a Doom like shoot em up on Mars. What could have been a sci fi ""Memento,"" 11 years before the fact, turned out to be nothing than a Swarzennager blood bath. A pity.",2.0
"When Total Recall was first released, I dragged a friend to see it. I had seen the trailer and I thought it would impress others as it did for me. Big mistake! The movie started off great. The plot seem interesting and suspenseful. Then, some rubber mutant freaks came wandering and I was left pondering over the embarrassment for recommending the movie. This embarrassment includes a rubber puppet popping out of an actor's chests, a chick with 3 rubber breasts and some other deformed plastic all-sorts walking around the set. If only they hadn't used any mutants in the movie. This film could have been more mature and if it was, it might have been a great all-time sci-fi classic. Instead, it turned out like a kiddie's movie. Personal Opinion! Schwarzenegger still rules.",2.0
"Nobody watches an Arny film for his acting - it's all in the action! So what's wrong with this film?
Paul Verhoeven gives his usual best in sex and violence - problem is with the art direction. The interior sets for the Mars colony look just like that - dressed up sound stages. Compare it to the visual brilliance of films like City of Lost Children, Blade Runner and even Dark City... these films take the audience to another time and place, even after repeated viewings through the years.
Total Recall just looks dated after barely a decade - styrofoam rock walls, plastic-looking doors, outdated hair styles... Just doesn't mesh well with the admittedly great SFX sequences. The magic is lost...",2.0

"Norman and Ethel Thayer are an elderly couple making their annual trip to their summer cottage. Once there, they bicker-quite a lot. Norman acts obnoxious, insulting, and out of it while Ether keeps calling him an ""old poop"". For being major actors, the two leads perform like a bad vaudeville team, and we nearly turned it off.

But the estranged daughter arrives as planned, along with her new boyfriend and his teenage son. After a short time, daughter and boyfriend have to go to Europe while they leave the son at the cottage. It is not too surprising how the rest of the movie goes.

Henry Fonda reportedly won his only Oscar for this movie, which is a shame because he gave far better performances in far better movies. Perhaps because he was about to die and they wanted to give him one before it was too late. There was certainly no other reason that anybody who had to do with this movie should earn any awards.",2.0

"Wonderful film?  Good god no.

It is the film that Spencer Tracy didn't live to make with Katharine Hepburn.  In Tracy's place, we have Henry Fonda.  And it (the film) and he (Fonda) are lousy.

Nothing happens in this film except for Jane Fonda doing a back-flip off of a dock to earn her daddy's love.  It's stupid.

According to legend, la Jane WANTED/NEEDED/HAD TO make this film with her Dad.  It meant so much to her. Unfortunately, it does not mean that much to the viewer.  All it took was a back-flip off of a dock?  What?

For all of the Fonda/Fonda publicity when this film came out, daddy Henry has woefully little to do.  He's Henry Fonda and he isn't acting now.  He's old and feeble and why Jane ""needed"" to do this with him is beyond me.  But she's Jane Fonda.  Egotistical in a way her father never was. But she's struggling through her ""issues"" and it's the 80's when we all had to get in touch with ourselves.  (This is almost ALWAYS the case when children of famous parents hit the limelight.  The parent is almost always the more talented and the offspring have ""issues"").

Since it's the 80's, Jane has some idiot blonde kid (her boyfriend's son) right out of Central Casting/80's sit-com who is too cool for school and teaches the old couple the way the young'uns think nowadays.  Atrocious.  To make matters worse, la Jane has fallen in love with (are you sitting down?) DABNEY COLEMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's the 80's.  It's Central Casting.  It's a sit-com.  It's atrocious.

Katharine Hepburn, in her unprecedented fourth Oscar winning role, dishes up the Fenwickian Hepburn a la carte.  She dives.  She lugs wood. she dispenses wisdom and elegant elderly lady wardrobe.  She's Katharine Hepburn; she doesn't have to act.

There are so many shots of the pond that those shots alone take up about 15 minutes.  The photography is gorgeous but how much is too much?

It's a bore of a film.  Jane whining about why her father hasn't cared enough/loved enough.  Henry just being an iceberg, and the wonderful Kate trying to thaw everyone.  But with diving all over the place and lugging wood and Indian chants, she has quite a full plate herself.

I adore Katharine Hepburn.  But an Oscar for this?",2.0

Wish I had known before purchasing it that it was not the one I thought.",2.0
"I have so much respect for Kathryn Hepburn's work that I was felt sorry for her putting up with this disrespect even as a character.

The language was so foul and assultive (is that a word?) that it was ruined for me.",2.0
"I remember watching this when it first came out. I had just entered my 20's, and at the time I don't think I even knew who Henry Fonda was. I think I knew who Katharine Hepburn was. I can't really remember my opinion of it then, except vaguely I think I thought it was only mediocre.

Now I am 42, and I enjoy classic film. I have seen many Katharine Hepburn films. I have only seen a few Henry Fonda ones because he has never been a favorite male actor of mine. Actually, he for the most part bothers me somehow, and I can't put my finger on it. It is the same way that Fred MacMurray really bothers me. How did these 2 ever keep on in the movies? Very weird icky leading men.

Anyway, my daughter wanted to see this film, to see KH and HF in old age roles. The library had it,  and we watched it last night. My main feeling is the same...only mediocre, nothing that great. Sure, there is some beautiful photography in there. But noone really impressed me with their acting, and I found the story a bore. I don't get into dysfunctional family films, and I don't like modern films (mid- 1960's to present). I don't think there were many such films in the classic film period. A few come to mind...A Bill of Divorcement with Katharine Hepburn and John Barrymore, and Dodsworth, with Walter Huston and Ruth Chatterton. But back then, movies were just so much better, more interesting. People did more than whine. Jane Fonda just seemed like a whiner. All thru the film I just kept thinking, get over it. The past is the past. Move on. Quit whining. I don't think she was a good actress here. Some of the lines she said just didn't convince me. Some of Henry Fonda's lines didn't have much feeling in them either. Back to Jane...she didn't always have to be in a swimsuit, tight shorts, halter tops...she must have wanted to show off her body a lot here.

I was very offended at all the swearing and bad language in this film. Since I do not watch modern films, to hear this is very shocking. Hearing 2 old people use vulgar language is sad. Hearing children use vulgar language is likewise sad. It didn't impress me. There was no need for these people to talk like that. Another reason I like the classics...people could talk then and had vocabularies. Also, they kept their clothes on.

I felt the story was hokey...too much of a ""quick fix"" in the end in the relationship with Jane and her dad. Years of a neglected relationship can't be fixed in 20 minutes.

I doubt I will ever watch this again. And I would definately not recommend it for children with all the bad language and the dysfunctional relationships. Katharine Hepburn definately did much better work than this film.",2.0

"I've sat through the entire nine-hour documentary series, and I admit I have more questions than answers and certainly some doubts about the official governmental stance on the Kennedy assassination.

"The question of the JFK assassination has never left the consciousness of the American people.  When the History Channel aired the first 6 parts of this series it helped to pique the curiosity of people like me who felt a deep sense of personal and national loss by this crime.  The Warren Commission only served to deepen this sense of loss and added betrayal and cover-up due to its superficial quality.  Over the decades some of its members have been well rewarded for their complicity.  See Gerald Ford for a case in point. These 6 parts cover the most superficial elements of the killing.  in the end they are little more than an ABC program about this event, that is, they offer only the safest information and background without drawing any conclusions that would annoy or offend their sponsors.
Several years ago, the History Channel broadcast 3 extra programs on the assassination that broke ground that few had been brave enough to discuss.  The programs included interviews with some of the most inside people left alive by those involved in the original conspiracy.  Unfortunately, the History Channel was unable to afford the legal threats leveled at them by members of the Johnson family among others and they published a retraction.
If you want a white washed discussion of the JFK assassination, they this series will due very nicely.  However, if you want some powerful visual evidence and analysis of the probably role played by Lyndon Johnson and other elements in the government, then you will need to go online and search for The Men Who Killed Kennedy episodes 7-9.  That is how I found this material for viewing online.",2.0
"This DVD is well presented, and is filled with some wonderful historic footage.
Unfortunately, its worth ends there.

The conspiracy theories in this documentary are just plain false.
After many years of research into this case, I have come to the rather disappointing and prosaic conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed the murderer of JFK. He acted alone, there was no conspiracy.

So why do I say disappointing? For years I believed that Kennedy's assassination was, and HAD to be a very carefully planned conspiracy. Many things added fuel to my belief; the political climate of the time, Jack Ruby popping up out of nowhere and shooting Oswald before any trial inquest could be done, the ""grassy knoll"", the ""magic bullet"", the apparent conflicting eye (ear) witness testimony, etc., etc. I simply could not accept the notion of some looser nutcase killing the President of the United States. It just did not balance in my mind. The answer could not be that simple, I thought. I realized that I (like Agent Mulder) WANTED TO BELIEVE. The Warren Commission Report, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations report, just added to the mystery. No one believed the Warren Report, it was full of mistakes. Even LBJ (though not publicly) was convinced that Castro was somehow behind the assassination. Then there was E. Howard Hunts ""confession"" when he thought he was dying.

I have always given equal time to both schools of thought; the ""conspiracy"" theory, and the ""lone gunman"" theory. I have spent a small fortune on books, videos, and trips to the National Archives. At some point in my research, I came to realize that even the best conspiracy theories lacked any good evidence. In fact, I was able to debunk every single one.

The KEY to understanding this case is the one thing that is sadly overlooked or ignored by conspiracy buffs. The key is Lee Harvey Oswald HIMSELF.

When you understand this man's life, the people close to him, and his history, the pieces of the puzzle fit together at last.

I would urge anyone who is truly interested, and who TRULY wants to know the truth, to study the best books on both sides of the debate. Do a thorough study. Cross reference points of interest, and take no one's word as Gospel.

Sometimes, we don't want to know the truth. Everyone loves a mystery, and ""conspiracies"" are very alluring. They are also very big business. The truth in this case is only as complex as the troubled mind of one man; Lee Harvey Oswald.

""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" is a very interesting introduction into some of the common conspiracy theories. View it critically. I also strongly recommend the following:

""Image of an Assassination"" - A new look at the Zapruder film. On DVD

""Someone Would Have Talked"" - by Larry Hancock. Hardcover book.",2.0
"When you get down to it, sadly, the objective investigations (whether in video or on paper) into the JFK murder are few and far between. Too many of them have one bias or another, and the results are usually a collection of half-truths and tantalizing but ultimately unusable evidence. These types of slanted investigations hold true for the Oswald-did-it-alone camp, as well as for the everybody-except-for-Walter-Cronkite-did-it school. The Men Who Killed Kennedy is no exception.
To the newly arrived investigator into the events of 11/22/63, there is a lot of intriguing speculation here, some of which has not been disputed. Still, there is a lot of shaky goings-on here. The ""computer enhancement"" that proves that David Ferrie was one of the shooters is an embarrassing case of ""computer manipulation"". And the guy shooting from the sewer? How did I ever miss that!?!?! Of course! That explains everything! (Shheeeesh!)
I suppose my frustration stems from my belief that there is enough evidence to prove that Oswald didn't do it alone, if he did it at all. Videos like this just make us all look bad.",2.0
"I just re-watched this on History Channel this week. The British producer sought to find ""new"" evidence - instead he just rounded up the ""usual suspects"" who have their old stories to tell. Much is made of how much Oswald (and later his wife) protested his blamelessness every time reporters were filming him, well duh how many criminals charged with a capital crime say ""Yeah I did it, I'm proud and I'd do it again?"" The interviews are presented without any supporting or contridicting evidence, for example the Ruby showgirl who saw Ruby & Oswald drinking together - oh yeah her friend saw it too ""but she's dead now"" - sounds mysterious, but that girl was just a drug addict who od'd. I liked the couple with their daughter (who was 6-7 at the time?), what-ya-know all 3 have the exact same story after 25 years. Yes, the Dallas police screwed up. They and everyone at the FBI and Secret Service was trying to cover his own butt, but that's about the level of ""conspiracy"" we've seen. Ps: Maria Oswald never said Lee spoke Russian like a native - actually she said his accent was so bad she thought he must be from one of the far-off republics - it was probably the first time in her life she'd heard someone speak Russian with an American accent! Pps: the mysterious ""missing brain"" was given to the Kennedy family, the producers chose to skip this.",2.0
"Hey, I like Doris Day -- I think she's underrated as an actress, and she is a very appealing personality.

In fact, he acted a lot like a little kid having a temper tantrum, and our daughter thought he was funny. But, a word of caution: after the Beast finally set the bird free, our two-year-old decided to emancipate our pet bird, and became upset when she couldn't.

"Jodi Foster has hit her prime a long time ago. She did a couple of fresh roles in The Accused and Silence of the Lambs. She was part of the overall hit Maverick. Yeah it was amazing (but in reality disturbing) to see her as a kid in The Taxi Driver and Freaky Friday. BUT . . . Flightplan was just Jodi Foster playing another character. Same mannerisms. Same whispering voice. Same sideways look when she is trying to play defenseless and vulnerable. Again she is one dimensional like Julia Roberts. When both of them were young and new we didn't care as it was a treat to see them. But after decades of them in movie after movie we just see Julia Roberts and Jodi Foster playing another role as themselves. Boring. Anyway this movie was a Hollywood liberal attempt at ""teaching"" Americans how to look at Muslims after 9/11, including the finger wagging. This movie was focused heavily on Muslims and Middle Easterns and how Americans ""stereotype"". It mocks our fear of their hatred. It mocks the memory of 9/11. But the overall plot was nothing more than Panic Room. Woman protecting kid (this time a daughter who actually looks, acts, dresses, and talks like a girl, not a boy. . . but traded in for a silicon injected lip, bugged eyed, big faced woman and a sinister villain who squints a drug induced look through the entire movie) against evil men. They never tell you why she was the target here unlike Panic Room. They never made all the connections including her husband's death. They just have a character mention it in passing. They never even explain why the villains are being villainous. They just have characters mention a few words about it is good for them that muslims were on board. They never link the muslims on the plane back to the window scenes even though they showed them to you. Anyway the only interesting part centered around figuring out whether there was a kid or not. But honestly I get tired of Hollywood mind game plots (e.g. A Beautiful Mind, Shutter Island, etc). It was something to fill the void of the movie or better yet the movie that they couldn't begin or end.

Anyway, I remember seeing this movie in the theatre and getting up and leaving after they started lecturing us about stereotyping muslims. I watched it recently here to see the final ending. Sorry I did.",2.0

"First let me say that there are several negative reviews with spoilers, so I won't reveal anything just in case you're thinking about buying this (thankfully, I just Netflixed it).  Second, let me say that anyone who would give this movie 5 stars either has very low film standards or is willing to give 5 stars to anything.

OK, as a quick aside, if we are going to have a system such as Amazon's in which we rate things 1-5, shouldn't 5 be reserved for the absolute pinnacle of what you're reviewing?  In other words, you can give Casablanca 5 stars.  But, you can't give an action/thriller starring Jodie Foster 5 stars unless you believe it represents cinematic perfection.  And if you believe that, you should not be allowed to review movies.  Granted, you can like this movie.  Even like it a lot.  But this is not a 5 star movie.  Period.

Rant about online reviewers over.  Now, as to Flightplan, it was at least somewhat enjoyable.  In fact, I think it really could have been a great film.  We've all seen movies in which the main character is thought to be crazy, lying, etc., and we either doubt him/her or we feel the franticness as no one believes them.  (Speaking of franticness, ""Frantic"" is how you do this kind of movie.)  Jodie Foster pulls off this role well, and there is good build up as to whether we should believe her or not.

Then it all comes crashing down.  Not the plane, that wasn't a spoiler, I mean the plot.  It starts to get insulting.  Why can't Hollywood have a great idea like this and then develop it into something thoughtful and well-thought-out?  There were so many ways it could have gone and didn't.  In the end, it was just ridiculous the leaps they want us to make.

I would not buy this film, but then again I don't buy a lot of films.  Only the really good ones.  I would Netflix/rent/iTunes this movie.  It is at least enjoyable for enough of the run time to be a good distraction for a dull night, a flight, a long wait somewhere, etc.  Then read the spoilers and see if you agree with all the load we were supposed to swallow.  Maybe you won't find flaws in the logic and the plot.  And then you can come back here and give it a five star review.  Or, like me, you'll enjoy it some and then roll your eyes and wish it was more like ""Tell No One,"" which I saw last night and which did this genre properly.  Hope this helps!",2.0

"Flightplan / B000BYY11Y

*Spoilers*

In my next life, I want Jodi Foster to be my mum. No one else can so convincingly freak out and tear a plane apart looking for her potentially-fictional daughter, even in the midst of a plot that Foster had to know was so riddled with holes as to make a block of swiss cheese seem completely solid in comparison.

Follow me through this: An exceedingly small cabal of terrorists, composed of a rogue air marshal, a flight attendant, and a funeral director, plan to murder the husband of a local engineer on the grounds that she will then book the next flight back to her parents in America on the big plane she's been working on. She will, of course, be bringing her husband's coffin on the same flight, which is crucial because they can hide explosives in the coffin where they won't be found (security doesn't scan coffins because....um.).

As part of the plan, it is absolutely essential that no one on a sold-out flight ever notices the engineer's daughter. I mean, seriously, not one child can say they saw the girl, not one parent can register ""hey, that kid's jumper is the same one I bought for Susan,"" nothing like that. This myopia must extend even to not noticing when the air marshal and flight attendant drug the girl, stuff her into a food cart, remove her luggage from the overhead bin, and steal the boarding pass from Foster's pant pocket.

Once Foster comes to, it is vital to the plan of the terrorists that she completely freak out and start turning the plane upside down looking for the little girl. Now to some people, that behavior may be a given, but it's just as possible that the mother might figure that, after all, it's a closed plane and she's not going anywhere, so she must have found some kids to play with and is moving through the grieving process healthily, so maybe it's best to give her some space and collect her when we land. Whatever, Foster freaks out and elicits the captain's aid on the grounds that the flight crew is less than helpful.

Hardly any time has passed before the captain has helpfully radioed ground control to find that the computer says (those frisky terrorists) that the little girl never even boarded. Displaying an uncharacteristic faith in computers, the crew figure that that is that, an assumption further backed up by another radio from the morgue stating that the little girl is, in fact, dead - even though there's only one coffin aboard, a detail that the captain is wholly incurious about.

Also, there's a red herring with some Arabic passengers whom Foster believes she has seen staring into her daughter's window a few nights before.

Eventually, the plane lands, the entire flight crew is ushered off except the terrorist flight attendant who inexplicably isn't, and Foster demonstrates that not only does an engineer know EVERYTHING about the plane she builds engines for, she also knows enough about explosives to tell, at a glance, what she can and can't blow up without damage to herself or daughter. She walks off the tarmac with daughter in hand, and everyone realizes that the crazy terrorist woman MUST be innocent, now that she has a little girl who vaguely looks like her.

Really, ""Flightplan"" is something of an enigma in that everyone on the project MUST have known what a terrible story they were telling, but they still do their best. The acting varies from superb (Foster) to decent (everyone else), the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and the sheer amount of effort that went into this movie is clear on every frame. I'm frankly astonished that they tried so hard, but they did. The result, however, is that the movie is unwieldy, boring, and trite since we never seriously suspect that Foster might be insane and the sheer inanity of the terrorist plot hurts the viewer's head.

"...they didn't get a real director to try getting this worthy of being viewed, especially with such a cast.....

"For some reason, I couldn't take this movie seriously. It was the way that all the people looked at Jodie Foster (Kyle) when she told everyone that her daughter was missing on the plane. The flight attendants and passengers looked like they were going to give ""that look"" from the comedy ""Airplane."" In fact, any minute I was expecting Leslie Nielsen to show up and say ""Stop calling me Shirley."" Wait a minute, I was expecting Sean Bean (The Captain) to say ""Stop calling me Shirley.""

Foster mentions to the captain and attendants that she was under the medication of Klonopin. Well, as the film kept dragging on, I felt like I was on Klonopin - not that I've ever taken Klono.......pin. Never mind.

It was a nice trip through the entire plane, while everyone was looking for Kyle's daughter. I loved the ""pained expression"" on the Sky Marshal's face when Foster was berating him. Come to think of it, seems like everyone had a pained expression when inconvenienced by Foster - in particular, the Middle Eastern guys. Goofy movie.",2.0

"A setting is a very important element of a film's plot and story development.  It should not, however, be the sole or primary reason for a film to be made or to have a script tailored around.  But in the banal movie FLIGHTPLAN, this appears to have been the case.  From there, we get an unsuspenseful mystery and an uninteresting thriller all rolled into one easily predictable formulaic plot.  Never having seen any of the film or heard about the plot before I watched it in its entirety, I actually announced my prediction for the outcome of the story 10 minutes into the film, and was fairly accurate.  That is not to boast of my prescience.  I am pretty sure many (if not most) of you could do the same or come pretty close.  It is hard to describe this film without giving too much away, so I will leave out most of the details and in a rare display of literary restraint, I will keep this review relatively short.

The story of the film concerns an aircraft design engineer (Jodie Foster) who boards a flight with her daughter from Europe back to the United States, with the casket and body of her recently deceased husband in the cargo hold.  But there's a strange twist that occurs once the flight gets underway.  Oh yeah, it's also supposed to be the world's largest passenger jet - big whoop!  This was almost inconsequential except only to allow for a supposedly immense myriad of places to hide, and ostensibly because it does not allow for escape (while in the air), as well as allowing for a convoluted fortuitous coincidence to benefit Foster's flaky character.  You will probably figure out who the bad folks are early on, and also the highly improbable and remarkably unimaginative twist to the ""mystery"".  The acting is highly overdone or creepy high camp, as are Jodie Foster's and Peter Sarsgaard's respective consistent acting hallmarks.  There is really nothing satisfying nor interesting about this dull and implausible film.  Those who have seen or will see this movie should have just skipped it like everyone else did.",2.0
"Ever fallen victim to an air controller's slowdown and spent agonized eternities locked in an endless queue of airplanes all waiting their turn to ascend?  If so, then you know how it feels to watch the first 20 minutes of this film.  Ever circled repeatedly over your destination as the pilot waited for landing clearance?  If you have, then you know how it feels to watch the last 15 minutes of Flightplan.

They say that one of the greatest mistakes a person can ever make is engaging the child sitting one seat ahead in a game of peek-a-boo on a trans-Atlantic flight.  Watching this film is a close second.  To give you an idea of how bad it actually is - the set of the airplane completely steals the movie.  In fairness, it's an extremely good set, and the cinematography is fine.  But only truly awful writing and direction can make a force like Jodie Foster look this foolish.

Viewers stuck watching Flightplan, who forgot to pack parachutes, will be reminded of Panic Room - except that Panic Room was a good movie with excellent writing, compelling characters, an interesting plot, and palpable tension.  Flightplan has none of these qualities.  The dialogue could be summarized thusly.  She:  ""My daughter is on this plane!""  He:  ""No she isn't.""  Eat you heart out Edward Albee.

The imaginary airplane that serves as the setting for this airborne drawing room murder mystery seats 450 people, we're told.  The number of key players is surprisingly small, given this massive headcount.  Many minutes are devoted to tight shots of Jodie Foster looking upset, as only she can.  Beyond that, there's virtually no acting to be found.  Peter Sarsgaard is absolutely awful as the Air Marshall.  Only Sean Bean, as Pilot, saves the day with a performance both credible and interesting.  This paucity, combined with a staggering lack of action and plot so thin as to be transparent, combine to make a film that soars almost as high as the Spruce Goose.",2.0
"If this was the film that was playing, I think I would give that walk a go.  This has to be the worst film that Jodie Foster has ever done, and not because her acting was poor.  On the contrary, she was fine for the role; however, the writing and plot were terribly formulaic.  From the second of the aforementioned quote it was evident to see where the film was headed, and it did not derail from the predestined outcome. While the premise was frightening, the thriller aspect of this film just did not convey.  In fact, it came across flat out hokey in several spots.  I adore both Foster and Sarsgaard, but how many times has she played a victimized overprotective mother, exactly?  Often enough that she should have it down by now--and she does.  Sarsgaard, though, seemed bored with his lines, all but delivering them between yawns.  The only real star in this film was the six year old daughter, played by Marlene Lawston.  Too bad she had so little time.",2.0
Jodie Foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end. The only mystery is in the details. No real suspense. I found the plot to be a little farfetched.,2.0
"I hadn't heard much about this film before buying it, slightly varying reviews, but that was about it. I thought being almost entirely set on a plane, it might be claustrophobic and it was very!

I'm surprised at Jodie Foster taking on this kind of role, but I have to admit she did well in the role, although she didn't have to stretch herself too far for the role. It was very basic.

The thing about Flightplan is that although the cast are good (Sean Bean, Peter Saarsgaard, and Erika Christensen), the plot really isn't up to much. A child could have dreamt up this plot, it's very basic, and it could have been set on nearly any form of transport, and it still would have been the same. It's just cos it's in the air, that it makes it what it is. But it's very racist at the same time, as Jodie's characters ""thinks"" she saw two foreign men across the road from her the night before getting on the plane, and then she ""thinks"" on the plane they're there, and they kidnapped her daughter. This plotline is started, but never really completed, and it's just another plotline in a dizzying number of them. The actors try to do their best in a film that has so many twists and turns, you never know what's going to happen next. But Flightplan goes one twist too many, and by the end of the film, you don't really care what happens, you just want it over. And there are quite a few plotholes as well, but it doesn't really matter.

Jodie should never have agreed to do this script. And neither should Sean Bean. The other two could have taken it or left it. Really, it will make you feel claustrophobic, if you do get claustrophobic on planes, but otherwise, it's not really worth seeing.",2.0
"...and it's staring at you on the video cover.  It's more proof of Jodie Foster's brilliance that she manages to make you care about this character, when absurdity abounds in every scene.  No joke -- watch this with a 6-year old, and have him/her point out all the things in it that don't make sense.  It's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy.  Watch it anyway, because Foster is always worth it.  But please, Hollywood, let's find this woman some projects that deserve her.",2.0
"Back in 1938, Alfred Hitchcock made a nice little comic thriller called The Lady Vanishes.  Although not one of his most well-known films, it is a minor classic that remains entertaining today.  This great movie is an obvious inspiration for the 2005 thriller Flightplan, but despite the slicker look of the movie, it is at best a pale imitation of its predecessor.

In Flightplan, Jodie Foster plays Kyle Pratt, an American engineer living in Berlin.  After the apparent suicide of her husband, she and her daughter Julia fly back to the U.S. with the body.  During the flight, Kyle falls asleep, and when she wakes up, her daughter is missing.  No one recalls seeing Julia and there isn't even a record of her boarding; in fact, the only recent record of Julia states that she also died in Berlin.  Naturally, everyone thinks Kyle is crazy, but it wouldn't be much of a story if that were the case; obviously something sinister is afoot.

I won't spoil things by saying what the sinister plot is, but suffice it to say that it is utterly ludicrous, one of those schemes that requires everyone behave precisely as the villains planned.  In particular, the scheme only works if no one on the plane can recall seeing the girl, a contingency that is quite the gamble.  (In The Lady Vanishes, this works a lot better.)  Several other things need to work exactly as schemed or the whole thing falls apart.

On the other hand, the movie is ably acted, with a good cast led by Foster.  The effects are decent and the writing is at least good enough to provide some suspense; it is really only as the movie is concluding that you realize exactly how dumb the plot is.  The plus points are enough to give the movie a high two stars, but if you are in the mood for a modern danger-on-a-plane movie, you'd probably be better off watching the enjoyable Red Eye; better yet, take a train instead and go with The Lady Vanishes itself.",2.0

"Flightplan: How to begin a movie so well and end it so poorly.  That about sums up my review for it.  To go more in depth, the movie begins with many questions, more so than answers and truly sets up a possible delusion situation with Jodie Foster's Kyle Pratt.  Is she insane, is her daughter missing?  Does anyone care?

I hate spoiler reviews, but I have to write one in order to discuss why I rated it so low.  Although, really if you've seen any of the trailer for this, you know everything I'm going to say.

To be honest, I really enjoyed about 1/2 of the film.  The mood it created, the claustrophobia, the feeling of unease was terrific.  Unfortunately, all of the major plot points have been ruined through trailers.  You know, just by watching one, that she gets on a plane, her daughter vanishes, then no one has seen her, then there's no record of her being on the plane, then there's record that she's dead.  Bam, that's the first half of the movie, given to you by trailers.  Then the ""big twist"" (if you can call it that), is stupid.  The one twist that HAS been hidden and kept under wraps is so mundane and silly that I felt let down.

Jodie Foster is, of course, excellent in playing the devastated and fearful mother.  But she's had experience in that, having done the better Panic Room prior to this.  Sean Bean is there.  I'm a little tired of directors relying on him to play stock characters.  He was good in Lord of the Rings, give him something more please.  And Peter Sarsgaard, well, his role wasn't exactly the most interesting and was a bit on the nose.

Marketing is so important anymore.  I enjoy trailers but I think they are destroying films.  I know that my knowing 1/2 of the movie before going to see it completely ruined my enjoyment of it.  It cheapens the experience.  In some movies, it only lessens my enjoyment.  However, for Flightplan, the only enjoyment to be had was in the twists that were revealed.",2.0

"Two problems with ""Flightplan.""  The plot is preposterous. It is based on a fundamentally illogical premise, and as it is developed, it becomes less and less believable.  To explain what I mean I'd have to spoil it.  I guess I'd rather have you go ""oh, please!"" for yourself.

Secondly, the sleek style of the film's direction is claustrophobic and not in a good way.  The performances are rigid and airless.  Jodie Foster is a very good actress, but she hardly seems like a mother.

The hype-write above compares it to the classic ""Lady Vanishes."" Yeah, there are similarities in the plot itself, but in a great movie like that, plot is what you don't notice as you enjoy the development of the characters, relationships and themes.  Maybe ""The Lady Vanishes"" is equally preposterous, but you'd never want to admit it, the movie is so great.  Here, the plot is all they've got.  Not one of the main characters is interesting in any way.  Their relationships simply don't develop.  They start and end in the same place, if they exist at all.

And as for theme, I guess it's ""if you think your daughter has been kidnapped but everyone says you're crazy, don't believe them.""  Words to live by!",2.0
"Sorry to say that this airborne psychological thriller feels like an overextended episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" without the irony and with the additional burden of spiraling plot convolutions that amount to a constant decrease in altitude. Jodie Foster is always watchable, and here she pulls out her vast arsenal of pent-up talent to play Kyle Pratt, an aeronautics engineer who is grieving over the week-ago accidental death of her husband in Berlin. She decides to fly back to the states with her young daughter Julia in the expansive jumbo jet she helped design. About three hours after take-off and having awoken from a nap, Kyle discovers Julia is missing, and the plot turns into her frantic search against escalating odds - a disbelieving crew, angst-driven passengers and an alternately sympathetic and dispassionate air marshal. The stacked deck set-up sounds Hitchcockian, a modern-day update of ""The Lady Vanishes"", but the movie actually feels more like a derivative take on M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" with a Michael Bay-type mindset.

For a movie that clocks in at 93 minutes, it feels unnecessarily long, and the search scenes drone on for quite a while without much emotional payoff. When the twists finally come to light, it becomes even more disappointing for the haphazard way it has all been presented. Director Robert Schwentke provides visual and aural interest but stumbles considerably on not only pacing but also providing a clear line of thought with the characters, their motivations and the subsequent actions. Some of the blame belongs to screenwriters Peter A. Dowling and Billy Ray, who seem more preoccupied with layering the perceived plot developments as a means toward justifying a climax high on octane but devoid of reason. Contributing to the problem is a middle section that reminds me of the worst attributes of the ""Airport"" disaster movies of the 1970's. There is a potentially interesting scene involving post-9/11 paranoia, but even this angle is botched due to its exploitative nature.

In what amounts to a retread of her ""Panic Room"" role, Foster manages the balance between desperation and tenacity with her trademark intelligence intact. The problem is that despite the new setting, the performance is unsurprising, and her unbridled strength doesn't resonate simply because we already expect her to be resourceful and uncompromising before the movie starts. Had her character upended Foster's persona, the movie would have been far more interesting. Another surprising disappointment is the generally reliable Peter Sarsgaard, who unfortunately falters quite badly as the air marshal. He seems too cerebral a presence to take on a role of such passive inconsistencies. Even though his role seems the most predictable, Sean Bean fares best as the conflicted plane captain who sympathizes with Kyle's plight but grows hesitant and wary over the mounting contrary evidence. Other fine actors are simply wasted such as Erika Christensen as an unobservant flight attendant and Greta Scacchi as an unctuous therapist.

The DVD has a surprisingly robust package for a recent release with a five-chapter, 40-minute making-of documentary, ""The In-Flight Movie: The Making of Flightplan"", and a less interesting 10-minute featurette, ""Cabin Pressure: Designing the Aalto E-474"". Both do their job of making the film seem better than it truly is, though be forewarned that the plot is completely divulged in the former. Schwentke provides informative, sometimes quite insightful commentary on an alternative track. His remarks, especially around the ending sequences, show careful thoughtfulness about certain story elements, though the necessity of retakes proves not enough attention was paid to logical connections and emotional payoffs.",2.0
"The only thing that left me scratching my head more than the movie was seeing here that so many people thought it was good!

This movie was very disjointed, as if it was badly edited by someone who knew the story too well and didn't realize they had cut out important scenes.

While it is listed as a thriller it didn't get ""thrilling"" until towards the end when Jodie Foster's character works her way through the inner chambers of the airplaine. This is easily 3/4 of the way through the film.

I was bugged by the fact that this ""state of the art"" aircraft would visibly shudder often while in flight.  I realize this may have been an attempt to make it look less like a sound stage, but it wasn't realistic.  If one were on a plane that shook violently every few minutes there would be some sort of panic or chaos.  This was not the case; the chaos was all created by Foster's character.

Jodie Foster was pretty good in her role as a frantic mother.  The ""bad guy"" was more smarmy than scary.

"Director:  Robert Schwentke

Cast:  Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Sean Bean, Kate Beahan, Michael Irby, Assaf Cohen, Erika Christensen, Marlene Lawston.

Running Time:  98 minutes

Rated PG-13 for violence and some intense plot material.

After the mysterious death of her husband, Kyle Pratt (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Julia (Marlene Lawston) are looking forward to relocating from Germany to New York City. After boarding an airplane she helped design, Kyle settles down for a nap, only to awaken and find that Julia is missing. Frenzied, Kyle demands the plane be searched, which irritates the flight attendants, and raises the suspicions of one of the passengers (Peter Sarsgaard). When each search comes up empty, fellow passengers start becoming agitated, and the captain of the plane (Sean Bean) wary of her motives, Kyle is forced to confront her own sanity and accept that Julia might not have existed at all. It's not any fault of ""Flightplan"" that it has to come out a month after Wes Craven's rollicking ""Red Eye."" After gorging on Craven's outrageous airplane thriller like it was a Halloween night candy bonanza, ""Flightplan"" dares to mount a similar nightmare-in-the-sky experience, this time crusted with a little more refinement and an A-list acting pedigree.

Jodie Foster returns to a big screen starring role after her 2002 hit, ""Panic Room."" At first glance, the two films are quite similar, requiring the veteran actress to play an extremely physical part, maintaining intensity like a pro while crawling around tight spaces and confronting everyone in sight. ""Flightplan"" is a good example of Foster's uncanny ability to make almost any material work, and her performance here is a major reason why ""Flightplan"" has credible moments of any entertainment value.  Directed by German-born Robert Schwentke, ""Flightplan"" is a picture that is entirely about the art of persuasion. To delve into the plot too far would give away the surprises that Schwentke and his screenwriters have in store for the audience, much like ""Red Eye."" However, Schwentke takes the opposite route of Craven, and begins to fancy himself a Hitchcockian type of director, taking the film very seriously, even when the screenplay begins to veer off into the abyss of ridiculousness. Schwentke knows how to assemble a good suspense sequence, and ""Flightplan"" sets itself apart by freely exploring the post 9/11 airline world with its collection of undercover air marshals and suspicious Arab passengers.

When truths are finally revealed in the second half, ""Flightplan"" slips into action mode, and things become increasingly hard to swallow. Schwentke doesn't seem prepared to handle the more outlandish moments of the extended climax, but the scenes work regardless since the film is so blessed with acting talent. By this time in the film, the audience is ready for a little brutality, and Schwentke is willing to give it to them, just not with the same quality of execution found in the first half.  The real problem with Flightplan is that the more you think back, the more you become frustrated with how inconceivable the whole charade was; the more you become irritated with how often you were lead to wonder about something eventually irrelevant. There are some films that don't give you all the answers and pull you along on a suspenseful ride, and leave you feeling fulfilled when you finally figure everything out, and everything fits together. ""Flightplan"" concludes, you know the culprit, and then you think back, and nothing fits together.",2.0

"""Flightplan"" is one of those you-must-suspend-all-the-critical-belief-you've-ever-used-to-function-as-a-sapient-human-being, contemporary Hollywood thrillers. It is easy, of course, to be smug and caustic about such presentations, which as I've argued elsewhere are part of the burgeoning Dumbing-Down-of-America movement which is especially prevalent nowadays in the motion picture field. This particular example also further advances its mediocrity by stealing from (of course the writers like to claim it is ""in homage to"") several other movies of the genre from time past, such as ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""Bunny Lake is Missing"", both of which managed to entertain without resorting to a nearly complete logical breakdown of plot.

Acting-wise, we get in ""Flightplan"" what has become today pretty much a standard Jodie Foster vehicle. She turns in a competent performance certainly, though at times she can become a tad whinny. If her acting is also forced to veer crazily between near psychic incapability brought on by a sudden severe tragedy, and a brilliantly competent display of expertise in both the fields of criminology and aviation technology, it is of course the fault of the incredible script that she must twist herself into such a schizophrenic display. The usually underrated Sean Bean -who would have made a much more suitable Aragorn than Viggo Mortensen in ""Lord of the Rings"", had that movie's director been more faithful to the original source - gives a stolid performance which is forced to turn into almost complete concrete by the end when he becomes the simple-minded pawn of the chief villain. As for Peter Sarsgaard, one can only wonder at the praise that has been thrown at his near-drugged, snake-eyed performance by many reviewers here or elsewhere. One simple question should suffice for these people: Is this really how you would want a real-life air marshal to look and act if your safety was ever in his hands 40,000 feet above terra firma? All-in-all, such a gun toting protector who has apparently sniffed just a bit too much airplane glue should hardly give one the strongest post 9/11 confidence in our country's aviational war on terror.

Again, one can complain ad nauseam about the plot holes in a movie that, alas, also includes long introspective scenes allowing one to not only see the holes easily, but to literally fall in and swim around in their glaring irrationality. But what disturbs most is not simply that the writers - and by extension, the director, the producer (Mr. Glazer, whose appearance fits all to easily into the adolescent-brained image the movie conveys), and also sadly the audience who are thought to be so capable of so suspending their intellectual capacities that one wonders if these capacities aren't lost to them beyond recovering once outside the confines of the multiplex's front door, could with just a little semblance of labor either asphalted over or even completely avoided at least some of the script's pitfalls in the first place. Foster's character is called a propulsion engineer, for example, when absolutely nothing in the movie involves the slightest knowledge of the workings of the airliner's engines. Since a knowledge so thorough it even survived her highly distressed psychic situation of avionics and cabin design was what was needed for her character, how difficult would it have been to simply label her as one of the plane's aeronautical designers, a catchall phrase that might have kept the more conscious members of the audience from bursting out into incredulous guffaws a good half a dozen times during the movie? And why was she allowed to load onto the airplane first and alone with her daughter, thus straining believability to the extreme that no member of the crew ever saw her come in the door or move down the aisle or take her seat - couldn't she simply have been shown boarding in a crush of other passengers who are all too preoccupied with getting settled in to be individually noticeable? Since none of the eventually revealed villains had the ability to tamper with the plane's passenger list, thus removing her daughter's reservation as the script said they had done, couldn't her necessary presence on the list have been explained away as due to her having simply bought a ticket for her daughter in her neurotic fantasy that she was still alive? And couldn't it have been shown at some time that her going to sleep - so necessary to the plot's success - was induced by a drug put into a drink by someone? Couldn't, in other words, the writers have spent at least a brief amount of their well-paid time coming up with at least a few plausible steps in the plot that would have rendered it somewhat less incredible and dependent on a train of events so lengthy and beyond the perpetrators' control that they had about as much chance of pulling their caper off as a monkey has of writing Shakespeare? There was a time, perhaps not even as far back as ""Bunny Lake"", when that was what writers believed they were supposed to do, fully in keeping with the integrity of their profession. Sadly, not only is a script like ""Flightplan"" an indication of the current worth in which they hold their profession, but even more an example of the contempt in which they - and the others involved in such an insult to rational entertainment - hold us, the paying audience. And just maybe, tragic to say, from all the positive reviews and the large attendance this movie has gotten, they are right.",2.0
"As some of you have said before, I personally thought this was a paranormal thriller type movie,,,,but what a let-down to actually find out the real story behind it all.  There are indeed many plot holes that seem way too big to just brush off (no one saw the daughter on the plane?..she was the first on board!! No one saw her daughter being kidnapped and injected with a drug or her luggage being taken?).  The main character's daughter acted like a complete unfeeling zombie, I would have been glad to get rid of her.",2.0
"We have two young daughters, and my wife was definitely disturbed by this one.  There's something primal about a story of a mother separated from her children that touches things that sometimes are best left undisturbed.  In this case, the discomfort of the premise outweighed the entertainment value.

Foster does a good job in the central role, but the plot is preposterous, the direction too slow, and the editing at the start is misleading, not in the sense of plot misdirection, but in the sense of setting up the tone for the rest of the movie.

Not worth buying.",2.0
"This thriller does keep you on the edge of your seat. After you have seen it, though, you are likely to feel, if you reflect on the movie, that creepy feeling of having been manipulated.

Jody Foster does a creditable job, but the script has too many plot holes to bear any scrutiny.

Why does the air marshall need to involve Foster's character, Kyle Pratt, at all? Who, if anyone, is behind the elaborate scheme that involves the suicide of the husband, the kidnapping of the daughter (Marlene Lawston), and the placement of the explosives in the coffin? Why does Pratt not seek medical attention for her daughter at the end?

The acting jobs by the captain and the air marshal are ok.

I questioned the sanity of a script in this day and age that portrayed an air marshall as a hijacker, just for the dramatic thrill. However, not long after reviewing the film,two Federal Air Marshals were accused of using their identification badges to smuggle drugs and cash through airport security. One of the accused allegedly threatened another that he would ""put him to sleep"" if he ratted out any other Marshals who may have been involved. So, maybe that aspect of the script is not insane. Still, it is anti-security propoganda that no one needs right now.

The daughter does not have much to say, but in the run-up to the flight, she has such a hardened, neutral (not depressed or sad) affect, that I suspect she was misdirected, or clumsily directed, or confused by the instructions of a director who needed a translator. (This is the director's first English-language film.) The net effect of the daughter's performance was, for me, that I did not care about her.

The script could have used a doctor, and the plot could have been simplified. But then it would have been a different movie.

I am left with the feeling that I wasted my time on manipulative fluff.",2.0
"..but I just can't.  I'm a Jodie Foster fan for the most part (did anyone besides me notice her frightening resemblance to Michael Jackson in this film?)  However, her success with ""Panic Room,"" which was a better film all around, seems to have spawned this thriller.  Sadly, this one is full of way too many plot holes to take it seriously. Foster is a strong actress as always, but her abilities can't keep this flight up in the air.  It's contrived, unbelievable and, though it has a nice set up, it's ultimately a huge let down.",2.0

I did enjoy the design of the plane.  It was neat to see a full lounge/bar and huge plasma TV screens in front of each seat. The technology was displayed in an up-to-date atmosphere that allowed the starbucks/cellphone/IPOD generation to feel right at home.

"The first part of the movie was well done.  Was her daughter with her or was it just the thought of her daughter that overcame her?  I began to have doubts, as the flashbacks appeared on the screen, and with the growing certainty of the passengers and crew that they never saw her on the plane.  I thought of Hitchcock's THE LADY VANISHES, where the gentle older woman disappears as her newly made friend takes a nap on a train.

But then everything changed.  The movie was too good to be true, and it degenerated into a standard, nonsensical thriller, with Arabs, with hints of hijacking, with threats of a remote controlled bomb, with ransom demands, with guns, and with an intricate murder plot.

It is always a pleasure to see Jodie Foster, and to see the quality of her acting.  But she just couldn't save this movie.",2.0
"The purpose of this review is to answer some questions other reviewers have raised.
1) yes, coffins all have electronic keypads where you type in a combination in order to access the recently departed individual.  This is to prevent corpse tampering and/or looting.  As a mortuary marshall, I personally perform retinal scans and cavity searches on bereaved family members before and after they access the RDI.  The cavity search may seem an extreme protocol but nevertheless it is standard operating procedure at all mortuarys.  You'd be surprised at how many BFMs are caught leaving the scene of a wake with something shoved up their rectums.  Also, some BFMs try to smuggle something into the coffin that they have concealed in their backsides.  Modern morgue security can prevent all this.
2) Yes, ""propulsion engineers"" who design jet engines do have an in-depth knowledge of the cabin and cargo layouts and electrical wiring of jumbo jets.  They are trained to know how to climb out of an airplane toilet into the bowels of the aircraft.  Once in the plane's innards, they crawl around until re-exiting into the toilet and then returning to their seat as though nothing unusual were happening.  This is part of their training.  My brother in law Vince is an aerospace engineer and he just got back from a week-long training retreat in which he was smeared in camo paint, combat crawling through an airplane toilet most of the time.  You crawl up one wall, across the tiny ceiling, then down the other wall, says Vince.  This is known as ""doing a spatial.""",2.0

"""Flightplan"" strings its audience along quite well for an hour before collapsing face first when it makes that last turn of plot. Admirable tension. Insulting revelation.

Jodie Foster plays beneath her talents as Kyla Pratt, an airplane engineer flying from Germany to America for the funeral of her husband, whose casket lies in the cargo hold. She has a young daughter, Julia, who disappears early in the flight. Kyla knows the plane, and knows where and how to order a full-fledged search of it. An air marshal (Peter Sarsgaard), two airline attendants (Kate Beehan and Erika Christensen) and the lead pilot (Sean Bean) are the primary search party. Nothing comes up. In fact, Julia isn't in the passenger log. In fact, Julia has been listed by the German coroner as dead.

There is an answer to this, and it doesn't involve ghosts or Kyla dreaming it all up. Before this solution is revealed, director Robert Schwentke nicely handles the red herrings, which includes a couple Middle Eastern men who were seen by Kyla the night before. Are they the kidnappers? What is the short sequence with that therapist all about? Which of those two flight attendants seem less trustworthy? Is the air marshal straight up? The captain? Did the husband really commit suicide? Is he even dead? Is Elvis? Paul? Tupac?

It mostly works until the point when the movie must show its hand, and while the villains of ""Flightplan"" mildly surprised me, they did not delight me. The questions that film critic Roger Ebert asserts won't hit you until after the movie assaulted me immediately. The odds of the Julia Plot getting as far as it did were equal to winning the Powerball lottery. Maybe that person in Oregon bought it. I didn't.",2.0
"If I were to rate the movie based ONLY on the first three-quarters of the film, I would, as would other viewers, give it a 5. But at some point close to the beginning of the end, the director totally lost the plot.

I shall refrain from writing details of the story (other reviewers have already done that) but will add my two bit -
1. The movie borrows heavily from ""The Lady Vanishes"", one of my favourite Hitchcock movies. In the Hitchcock movie, the herione is not believed when she says that a woman travelling in her train compartment vanishes. The existence of the vanished woman is doubted by all. Of course ""Flight Plan"" takes place on a flight and the heroine's daughter (and not a co-traveller) goes missing. The point when the heroine is convinced that she is NOT delusional (as others make her out to be) is when she sees a drawing made by the missing person on a window which is visible only when the window fogs up. This turning point is directly lifted from ""The Lady Vanishes"".
2. In the first half, the director DOES manage to build up suspense when we know that something is about to give and we try to guess it in advance but very few, I am sure, would have guessed the plot. Which brings me to the plot itself.
3. The Plot is totally unbelievable which is why no one could guess it in the first place. This unfortunately, happens to be weak point of the movie.
4. The Ending is as tame as they come. After an hour of nerve racking suspense (which is slowly built up till the 'twist' is revealed), there is a sudden drop in the tempo of the movie. The end happens to be as bad as the plot. So a person who had to leave the movie three-quarters of the way would have enjoyed the movie many times more than the person who actually saw it till the end.",2.0

"This movie had great potential to be a fantastic movie. Good directing, great setting, top notch cast, emotionally draining suspense... Problem: No one told the writer. Its like they had everything lined up and ready to go and then realized one week before release that they'd forgotten to figure out the conclusion. ""Eurika!"" Shouts an eager cameraman, ""Lets take away ALL the human drama and make this film all about money! Just add in a bunch of cheesy lines that Sarsgaard can scream to clear up all the gaping holes in our plot and throw in a big explosion - maybe the kid can say something cute too. The audience will never notice the grotesquely outrageous proportions, really!""

And he was partially right. According to many reviews, a good ammount of people graciously catapaulted over the grand canyon plot holes and enjoyed the film. If your in my group of viciously analitical film critcs, then I also reccomend you reading C. Welch and RMurray847's reviews of this movie on this sight. Great reviews.

So, after bashing this movie up one side down the other, you may ask, why the two stars? Well, you just cant deny Foster - she was the only believable thing in this movie, great acting. And Sarsgaard is simply a pleasure to watch. He didn't get much depth of character or room to shine his incredible talent, but it still peeped out in several scenes.

So, the plot is dreadful and the lead actors are wonderful. Solution? Check out other Foster and Sarsgaard movies and leave this flight before take off.",2.0

"Review of ""Savage Sam"".
If you have never seen ""Old Yeller"", you will not be so disappointed by ""Savage Sam"", and may enjoy it.

Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker are noticeably absent. Beverly Washburn, the girl who played Elizabeth Searcy the daughter of the lazy neighbor is replaced by another actress breaking believability. Elizabeth's part was small but memorable, and she could not be replaced without notice, or even left out without notice. The dog is not the yellow dog pup we saw at the end of ""Old Yeller"". The film begins repeating things done in ""Old Yeller"" in an attempt to connect us to ""Old Yeller"", is really lazy trading on ""Old Yeller"" instead of coming up with something new. Disney had several of the original actors under contract, still had the cabin set, and decided to make some easy money without putting any effort into the script. Disney got away with shooting Texas in California in ""Old Yeller"", but could not get away with trying to tell us the Indians in this film are Apache and Comanche amidst California Oak trees when such Indians inhabited the red rocks of Arizona.

Kevin Corcoran was charming in earlier films ""Old Yeller"", ""Swiss Family Robinson"", ""Pollyanna"", and ""Toby Tyler"" just playing himself, and reacting as a kid his age would, but here he has grown much bigger, 6-years after the first film, and outgrown those roles. A kid his age and size in this film would respond differently. The writers here force cuteness that looks out of place. Brian Keith should have used his normal voice instead of using an odd accent for no purpose.

The writers could not successfully continue the story without Beverly Washburn who played Elizabeth, because her continuing romance with Tommy Kirk is the next logical step. Disney should have wined and dined her to get her to appear. Even a 30-second appearance by Fess Parker and Dorothy McGuire at the beginning would have helped immensely. Otherwise, Disney would have been better off putting Tommy and Kevin in an entirely different film. It is a lazy script. I heard Mr. Searcy wrote the script.

"This movie hit the theaters on Christmas Day in 1957 starring Dorothy McGuire as Katie Coates, Fess Parker as Jim Coates and Jeff York as Bud Searcy. Based on the novel by Fred Gipson, Old Yeller is set in Texas in 1869. While his father is away on a cattle drive, 15-year-old Travis Coates takes over management of the family farm. Adopting a strictly business policy, Travis is irritated when younger brother, Arliss, adopts a frisky stray dog. Soon Travis is as fond of the dog as everyone else in the family is; moreover, ""Old Yeller"" is an excellent watchdog. However, while fighting off a mad wolf, Yeller is infected with rabies. Though Yeller seems unaffected at first, he eventually behaves so viciously that the disheartened Travis has no choice but to **** *** ***. A heart-to-heart talk between Travis and his returning father coupled with the adoption of a new pup, paves the way to an emotional but reasonably happy ending. Earning eight million dollars domestically on its first release, Old Yeller convinced Walt Disney to devote more and more time to live-action films and less time to animation, which at the time was a great business move. In 1963, Disney released a lesser sequel to Old Yeller titled Savage Sam. I was wasn't that crazy about this picture either. To me once the dog got in the fight the movie was over. I give this movie Two-weasel stars because there was not much drama or action in this movie other then the fight with the wolf.",2.0

"It's almost hard to fathom a studio having so little respect for its classic movies. This ""Vault Disney"" release of ""Old Yeller"" is a perfect example.
The ""Vault Disney"" releases are promoted as ""high end"", supposedly better than the cheapy ""movie-only"" releases of many of Disney's live action movies.
From the initial opening credits, with the worst example I have seen of ""grain"" in a picture outside of a non-major-studio release, I knew this was going to be another Disney disaster. Though the grain subsided SOMEWHAT, the softness of the picture throughout was not even close to what I would expect of a classic movie release. While my widescreen television is relatively small, I'd hate to see how bad this picture would look on a large widescreen display.
In addition, the chintzy packaging for these movies is hardly up to ""special edition"" quality either, and the majority of the extras are nothing more than more ""Disney"" horn-blowing.
I will commend them for the inclusion of one of Pluto's best cartoons {""Bone Trouble""}, and for the current-day interview with Tommy Kirk {whom I would have NEVER recognized}.
However, all in all, Disney should be ashamed at the quality on such a classic film release.",2.0
"Old Yeller"" is the heart-wrenching family drama about two brothers, Travis (Tommy Kirk) and Arliss Coates (Kevin Corcoran) and their faithful golden retriever - Yeller.  When the boys' father, Jim (Fess Parker) leaves on an expedition, mother Katie (Dorothy McGuire) becomes the head of the household. This is one of Disney's first attempts at capturing the great outdoors and vitality of the old frontier plains and it is one of their enduring live action masterpieces. Arliss is always getting into trouble - engaging wild bears and skunks and other critter in the brush, only to be saved in the nick of time by Yeller. However, when Yeller contracts rabies it is left up to Travis to do the humane thing and put his best friend out of misery. Upon its initial release the film did phenomenal box office. And there are still those who get a lump in their throats and a tear in their eye when this heartbreaking family drama and coming of age flick is mentioned in mixed company.

Unfortunately for DVD-philes, this isn't Disney's best despite being advertised as part of their new 2-disc ""Vault Disney"" series. In fact, visually it's not even close to what a film like ""Old Yeller"" truly deserves. For starters, the print used to master this DVD is very softly focused while still managing to be riddled with edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering of fine details. There's a lot of pixelization throughout that really breaks up fine detail. Color is poorly balanced, betraying the lushness of many of the outdoor scenes, with greens, in grass and trees shifting color from brownish beige to muddy beige and then back again. Flesh tones are never natural but appear too, too orange. Fine detail is generally lost in the darker scenes. The audio has been remixed to stereo but is very, very strident and forward sounding. At times it's painful on the ears and really doesn't hold in comparison to the fidelity of the period.

Disney does gets top marks for their supplemental materials. We get documentaries, isolated scores, vintage advertising and short subjects, a gallery of stills, trailers and television spots and interviews with the surviving cast members. What more could anybody ask for? A better print of the film, sadly!",2.0

"Movie Review:

Pretty Woman is an okay movie. It's not great, but it's not bad. At the end, I was left thinking, ""Well, that happened..."" without any emotional pull toward any direction. Julia Roberts character was decent, and Richard Gere was...Richard Gere. Lifeless and devoid of any emotion. The story was decent (Who doesn't love Cinderella? Except her step-sisters and step-mother...), but everyone talks about the ""You work on commission, don't you?"" line, and there was no follow-up to that scene whatsoever. It seemed utterly pointless. It reminded me of ""No one puts baby in the corner"" from Dirty Dancing - the most random of quotes with no relevance to the rest of the film. Jason Alexander as a sleaze was the highlight of the film. I love to see him play odd roles.

Demi Moore stars as expectant mother Abby Quinn in this religious thriller, which never manages to generate any real excitement or suspense. The large scale of ideas that are presented become siphoned by the rather narrow scope that director Carl Schultz fails to overcome creatively. We are only ever allowed to see the aftermath of each disaster, but we never witness the actual onslaught or destruction as they occur. What we are left with, instead, is Moore's character wading through a long series of discoveries that are as bland and predictable as they are tiresome. Jrgen Prochnow plays the only memorable role as the mysterious wanderer, David Bannon, with passable performances from Michael Biehn and Peter Friedman, as well. The final reveal in the end will come as little surprise, and offers even less logic or explanation. Only fans of other religious thrillers like THE PROPHECY or STIGMATA will find any interest here.

Jesus Christ Himself is one of the main characters and this is one of the best depictions of Christ in film, if not THE best. He's by far the most interesting character in the movie (I'd tell you the actor playing the role but I don't want to give away who the Messiah is as the movie keeps it kinda discreet, not that it's too hard to figure out). I just wish they gave JC more screentime and dialogue since he's so intriguing; it would have made for a much more compelling picture. As it is, the film focuses on Demi and she's just not that interesting a character.

I enjoy movies that make you reflect and try to figure out. This is such a film. Some have criticized that the story is nonsensical, but it's all there clear as a bell if you reflect on it.

One reviewer criticizes that the film lacks substance, yet the story deals with nothing less than the salvation of humanity via sacrifice, faith, hope and love; plus Jesus Christ Himself is a major character. I think this qualifies as substance.

If you're having trouble figuring the story out ask yourself this question: Why is Jesus Christ attracted like a magnet to Demi and her baby? Once you have that figured out the story makes perfect sense.

I'd also like to point out that the film is expertly made on practically every level. This ain't no low-budget fare.

People seem to have trouble categorizing ""The Seventh Sign"" because it's so unique. I would say it's a mystery/horror film, but don't think ""horror"" in the sense of a slasher flick, ""Seventh Sign"" is more classy than that. Although there's loads of dead bodies and blood there's hardly any cussing and no youths getting naked.

As far as Biblical eschatology goes, the story gets it fairly accurate up to a point but then takes a creative turn. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away. Regardless, keep in mind that the main message of the film is completely Biblical, i.e. salvation only comes via the spilling of blood and faith, hope & love.

Unfortunately the film has a bit of a tedious vibe despite the numerous intriguing aspects, which is a major flaw considering it only runs about 90 minutes. Again, they should have given JC more screentime and dialogue as he is definitely the most interesting character. Because of this tedious vibe I give the film an overall strong 3/5 Stars or C+ (if I was in a better mood I'd give it a weak 4/5 Stars or B-). In other words, although ""The Seventh Sign"" has some undeniably great elements, overall it's neither great nor horrible; it's somewhere inbetween. Regardless, it's very worthwhile if the subject matter piques your interest.",3.0
"This came out I think around the time time as Top Gun.  And was overshadowed by it.  You just have to watch the movie.  It's good on it's ow.  You just have to tell yourself it's just a movie.  Because most of the plot is unbelievable,  The acting by Lou Gossett Jr. is good.  And I just watched Executive Decision yesterday.  And David Suchet is a good as a terrorist.",3.0
"""Taxi Driver"" is a character study more than a story. I can believe that Paul Schrader wrote the screenplay in a fever dream while living in his car: it's mostly about a state of mind, the main character's loneliness and rage. All the other plot details were probably added after the fact. Complementing the script, Robert De Niro buries himself in the part more than in any other film of his career.

The film frequently feels nervewracking because of how deeply it sees into the protagonist's mind. A few words into De Niro's ""Listen up, you screw-heads"" speech, there is a curious jump-cut and the speech starts over from the beginning. But it's not some avant-garde film device, it's pure reality -- for someone like Travis Bickle, every internal monologue is a rehearsal, he is always imagining himself as an action hero, always playing a scene out in his head, thinking of cooler versions of his ""lines"" and revising them in mid-delivery. The famous ""you're talking to me?"" line is actually part of a long series of threats that Travis makes to an invisible enemy while posing in front of a mirror with his guns.

In his isolation, Travis can only function in his rare social interactions by relying on cues from previous events. For example, he asks the arms dealer for a specific type of gun, but he first learned the name of that gun only a few days ago when it was mentioned by one of his clients. This completely random event allows him to appear knowledgeable about guns, but really he knows nothing about the type (and ends up buying all of them). Psychologically, this is a fine nuance, one of the things that shows how well the film-makers feel their character. It also contradicts the formal plot of the film -- as a war veteran, wouldn't Travis have picked up some information about firearms? (More importantly, wouldn't he at least have picked up rudimentary conversational skills from the guys in his platoon?)

But the film-makers don't care about that. According to them, the Vietnam backstory was meant to highlight Travis' alienation from society, and I suspect they just didn't bother to think through plot consistency. For years, viewers have debated whether the ending (in which, ironically, Travis is hailed as a hero) was meant to be ""real,"" or whether it only took place in Travis' head. But you might as well ask that question much earlier. Did the entire shoot-out ever really take place, or was it just part of Travis' action-hero fantasy? Did he really try to assassinate Palantine, or did he just fantasize about it, and then ""revise"" his fantasy to follow the more ""romantic"" storyline of rescuing the girl from the pimps? Did he really shoot the robber in the store? Was he ever even in Vietnam? If he self-importantly tells people that he's ""doing some work for the government,"" why couldn't he make up a Vietnam background? Was his exercise regimen real, or did he just imagine himself holding his hand out over the gas burner? As many critics have pointed out, nearly every scene is told from Travis' point of view, so potentially any scene after the failed date could be the film's last moment of ""reality.""

It is intellectually interesting to think about things like that, but unfortunately it is also a weakness of the film. The film-makers had a character, but ultimately they didn't know what to do with him or say about him, or how to end their movie. The film is a perceptive profile of a psychological type that could easily snap and become a loose cannon. But where did he come from, how did he get this way? The film's only explanation is Vietnam, but we have seen many Travis-like characters on the news in recent years, and usually they are not veterans. And, more importantly, is there anything that should or could be done to reach out to people like Travis? Was there ever any way to help him? The ending side-steps this question with some stylized violence, and then glibly criticizes media sensationalism (for you see, they would have condemned Travis for shooting Palantine, but they praise him for slaughtering a bunch of criminals). It's hard to argue with that, but it's also pretty obvious, and doesn't shed any useful light on the main issue.",3.0

"THE SEVENTH SIGN

(USA - 1988)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo

Carl Schultz' supernatural drama is a very low-key affair, despite its apocalyptic premise (the impending birth of a young woman's unborn child threatens to unleash God's Final Judgment on the world), but it establishes and maintains a genuine sense of impending doom all the way from the opening scenes in Haiti and the Negev desert in Israel, to an uncompromising climax in the execution chamber of an American jail.

It failed at the box-office, partly because it doesn't live up to its ""Omen""-esque potential, and partly because it's simply too clever for mainstream acceptance. The dialogue is laden with resonant phrases and descriptions, and viewers will need to pay close attention to catch many of the appropriate references, all of which have a bearing on the characters and their quest for moral redemption. A small masterpiece, ripe for rediscovery.",3.0

I love the movie because I have a thing for military planes, but the acting stinks, the plot is full of holes, and the characters are uninteresting.  I would have been just as happy watching 90 minutes of random f-16 footage.  This is the discount store version of Top Gun, but a guilty pleasure for me.",3.0

"But how can I, a child of the 80's, hate this ultimate 'boys movie'?
At the time, it made me want to strap myself into the cockpit of an F-16 and go bomb some terrorist country. I found Libya on the map. They seemed like some onery folk at the time. I was ready to drop some hellfire on them 'camel jockeys'.
But I could never get a hold of an F-16.
But judging by some of the reviews here, some lucky peepsqueaks DID manage to get F-16's. So many youths cite this piece of dreck as the reason they joined the airforce and are now doing the will of a commander-in-chief who probably goes back to his ranch, closes the door, and puts the 'Iron Eagle' DVD on!!
Ultimate boys movie indeed.
This doesn't change the fact that 'Iron Eagle' is unabashedly racist. It was mostly filmed in Israel with the IDF and Israeli government providing all the fighter jets AND pilots along with the scenery. All they asked for in return was that the villains be (nameless, faceless, dehumanized) 'Arabs' from a fictional (generic) Arab 'terrorist country'. This demonization of an entire people was (and is) an Israeli government PR campaign to get the American public to see the 'plight of the Jewish people' as they 'struggle' against the 'evil Arab terrorists'.
I would hope the producers of 'Iron Eagle' were duped into going along with this. Because other than that, it is a pretty fine movie. Unlike a lot of 80's action-movie dreck, 'Iron Eagle' actually has likeable characters. Louis Gosset Jr. delivers a fine performance as the 'tough but fair' Colonel 'Chappy' Sinclaire. The action sequences rival and sometimes better the ones in 'Top Gun'. Plus, there is no sappy romance sub-plot to drag this puppy down. This movie is purely a boys film.
So if you can turn your brain (and your conscience) off for an hour and 20 minutes, get a hold of 'Iron Eagle'. But watch out for the sequels. They're bad. Really bad.",3.0

I liked Peter Boyle also, whom I got to know from ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" and from what I saw in Taxi Driver, there is a mischievous quality about him that seems to come through always. And last, but not least, Harvey Keitel just blew my mind! If you haven't seen it yet and like, or at least tolerate, this particular genre of gore, I'm willing to bet that, in seeing these actors' work in their beginnings will show clearly and unmistakably the reason why they have become huge stars and received so many accolades.",3.0

"Jason Gedrick is Doug Masters, teen-pilot ace, son of a USAF fighter pilot, AF academy hopeful and high-school failure.  Doug is normally not that responsible a kid (mostly when tooling around in low-level air races in the family Cessna), but is forced to mature when his father is shot down and taken prisoner over an unnamed mideastern country.  A naturally gifted pilot, Doug has managed to cajole his father into taking him on some practice flights in the past, as well as worming his way into the base's F-16 simulator.  Now with the help of ""Chappy"" Sinclair (Louis Gosset Jr.), a crusty but not rusty reserve fighter pilot, and some of Doug's friends - a click of army-brat and aviation enthusiast-teens who populate the unnamed desert air force base where Doug's father stages - the younger Masters plans an impossible rescue.  Together with Chappie, Doug seizes a pair of twin-seat F-16's, loads them up to maximum payload, and flies into hostile territory.
This movie came out in late 1985 and would have been toast had it appeared about six months later when ""Top Gun"" was released.  The premise is improbable, the flight scenes suffer in comparison to those in ""Top Gun"" (instead of the carefully choreographed dogfights and editing, IE has plenty of footage of the F-16's digital instruments - the flight scenes themselves look like stock footage and repetitive at that), special effects aren't great (enemy jets explode like toy models; the MiG blasted on the ground is not only an obvious dummy, but shot at the angle to make that most obvious; the sound is horrible)  and the realism is also pretty low apart from the premise - fully loaded F-16's aren't in any condition to dogfight (at least until the advent of the AIM-120 missile well after this movie came out), while flack guns seem almost entirely non-existent and enemy jets simply explode with the push of a button.
Still, this was a fun movie and seemed to capture that sense of harmless (for our side anyway) jingoism of Reagan's 2nd term.  The plot goes a surprisingly long way into dealing with the inherent implausibility (Doug is good, but he's rough and his limits are well mapped out).  Also, much of the reason that IE falls behind TG has to do with the fact that F-16 isn't as photogenic as the F-14 (not that it's ugly - simply that it's smaller and hard to spot.  You simply see a speck that becomes an F-16 and disappears again in a flash, a deficiency on film that most F-16 pilots would doubtless prefer to live with).  The Israeli Kfir jets are quite convincing stand-ins for the MiG-23 (at the time, the US Marines flew leased Kfirs in dissimilar air-combat training), and only the most annoying military aviation enthusiasts will harp on how the USAF F-16's in the movie are painted according to Israeli colors (and how single-seat F-16A's mysteriously morph into twin-seat F-16B's and vica-versa).  Most of all, this was the first jet movie I'd really seen, and it was impressive enough for me to plunk down ($) for my first computer flight-sim program.  On a side-note, the soundtrack comes with ""One Vision"" by Queen, but the rest of the songs aren't up to that.  To get the song, I'd recommend Queen's own ""A Kind of Magic"" which also has some great tracks from the first Highlander movie.",3.0
"Maybe Iron Eagle is not one of the best movies but it is still a lot of fun. I especially liked the soundtrack which i own on CD. But 3 of the best songs were not included.

"I love Mel Brooks. When I heard he's having a collection coming out on Blu Ray, I was excited.

If you're a Mel Brooks fan, this is a no brainer. Now for the dissappointing aspects.

This box set WILL NOT fit on your DVD rack without there being some major changes to the layout of your entertainment center. The Blu Ray/book/jacket/thing is roughly the same size as a hard bound coffee table book. It's clunky and it falls apart easily (the binding agents ""glue"" was weak on my copy. To top it off, you're sliding Blu Ray discs up against straight up card stock inserts to get them out. It's more of an annoyance than anything, but if you can see through that, you're set.

You'll also notice that there's some movies missing. I'm not saying that Dracula: Dead and loving it should be wiped clean from human memory, but it's the completitionist in me that would like to see all his works in something named ""Collection"". It's really not a collection, isn't it. More like a ""greatest hits"", or ""The ones we want you to remember him by"". I was somewhat suprised that The Producers wasn't in this collection either. Was that 10th or 11th movie going to disrupt the balance of the box set and set the world ablaze? probably not, I'm guessing it was those two timing Hollywood lawyers that kept my dream from becoming a reality.

"""To some, Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader's perception of hell-as a crazed taxi driver's vision of New York City-was brilliant. To us, this gory cold-blooded story of sick mans lurid descent into violence is ugly and unredeeming."" (Leonard Maltin's Movie Review).

Maltin only gave the movie Two Stars out of Four Stars. In my opinion that's much too low. I will say this: I don't see this movie as Five Stars out of Five Stars or even Four Stars. I give it a solid Three Stars. I liked much of Schrader's script, because he encapsulated NYC perfectly for the time period. In a way I'm glad that I never saw the film before three days ago. It allowed me to go back in time and see things in the city for the way they once were. New York was bankrupt at the time and quite dirty. Harlem was getting worse before it was going to get better and the porn shops had already metastasized in the Manhattan downtown area. This was the world that Bickel was thrown into after Vietnam.

What's so interesting is how by the end of the film Bickel goes from being a zero to a hero and that was not even his true intent! His madness begins to exhibit itself when he stalks Cybil Sheppard's character at the beginning of the movie. The supporting characters are solid. But why Foster was given top billing when her character is only in the movie for less than five minutes' screen time in the first hour of the film is beyond me. Sheppard was the more logical choice for top billing in my opinion.

Paul Schrader has been a master at describing the lonely and disconnected man in his movies. American Gigolo and Light Sleeper are quite similar films and deal with men who are loners and have very little going for them in society save for their jobs. Those two films had more soul than this film. In Taxi Driver, despite the top notch performances, I feel that something was missing from the script. Many of the supporting characters were too laconic. Others were too loquacious in my opinion. But I admit that I probably need to see the movie again to understand it better. I might put it at Three and a Half Stars, but for the moment it is a solid Three Star rating. I marginally recommend this film because of the great Paul Schrader's screenplay and Martin Scorsese's fantastic direction. This was my 260th Amazon review.

"Don't get me wrong -- I LOVE the film. It's a classic of the mid-1970s and defined (and capped off) the era of the independent spirit of Hollywood (captured in Peter Biskind's book, EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS. Scorsese, Coppola, Bogdanovich, Spielberg, Lukas, Rafaelson, Hal Ashby, Warren Beatty, and even Jack Nicholson brought a European sensibility to Hollywood during the late 60s and early 70s. In some ways, TAXI DRIVER (1976) represented the end of that era, even as JAWS (released the year before) signaled the new direction Hollywood would go in -- and still goes in -- to the great detriment of American film. Thank goodness for the Indies!

The problem is that this version is only mildly better. Yes, it will more than likely force me to get it because bitrate is important but they could have at least given us the commentary.

The other version has tons of extras and a slightly different color tone and bitrate. I mean slight. For those that need the best for 15 dollars you get the best at the moment. Inevitable native 4K release in 3 years I'd say. Choice is up to you.

Also, this is so cleaned up, it takes the grittiness out of the print, and hurts some of the character of the film.

"This was the first time I have ever watched TAXI DRIVER. Even though I've become a true movie buff / entrepreneur, I realize that sometimes it's better to never watch these ""classic"" films and simply imagine what they were like in its place and time, than watching them nowadays for the first time with expectations that won't deliver the goods. There are so many of my favorites that came from this time (the 60's) in film history. But the catch is I watched them back then, which makes me appreciate them more now, rather than watching them now, which appreciates me back then. Am I saying that TAXI DRIVER is a bad film? Not exactly.  Did I really watch this movie? Indubitably!

The best part about this flick was seeing younger versions of Rupert Da Nero, Harvey Guitar and Jody ""Cannon"" Fodder. It's been awhile since I've seen Cyborg Sheepherder too, apparently she's been packing on the chunks over the years, but I haven't seen her myself. It was also great to see Peter Boppins (may he nap peacefully) but I'm beginning to wonder if the man ever had a full skull of working hair follicles. I love Skadaisy's work and own nearly two of his films on HD-DVD. There's no question that what he and Da Nero created here was pure brilliance at the time and again, had I watched this film way back when I was born, I would've understood this stuff much more clearly, but in this day and age a lot about the film just isn't relevant anymore (At one point the guy pays a prostitute with just a twenty dollar bill! The movie about lost me here).

A couple of positive things that really stood out in the movie were the relationship between ""Slick"" Travis and Ole' Bootsy and the conversation that took place between Travis and the secret service ""dude"" in Las Vegas. With Travis and Bootsy, well, most people would call Travis a clear-cut hopeless romantic and some of his more colourful ideas he shares with her certainly show this. But this brings me to my first issue, the dude's an underdog taxi driver and she's a successful geologist with options, I just don't see that combo ever cutting the slice. And who in their right mind takes a high society chick (or any chick) around town in a taxi on their first date? But I will say that taking her to a dirty movie was a classy move on his part, even thought she wasn't getting into it like he was. And as for the secret service guy, why did he wait so long to try and apprehend Travis? Red flags galore were going off during their poker game, more than enough to get a dude shot in the face these days, and considering how he gave the guy his real name (Henry Krinckle) and what I think was his real address (123 Fake Street), I don't understand why they weren't beating down his door with handcuffs and tasers.

TAXI DRIVER is an interesting love story, although our main protagonist is clearly supposed to be a likeable character, I had a hard time rooting for him, let alone understanding how things managed to keep working out in his favor throughout the film (except the ending, he totally got what he deserved). I do think they captured the loneliness of working in a factory right on the money, but as far as Travis being a war veteran, well I wasn't completely sold on that. The Hurt Locker was the best journey into the unstable mind of Vietnam Vets for me and I just didn't think Travis came off as that type of person. I will say this though, that all out b/a/l/l/s-to-the-walls dance off at the end was totally awesome. Hip-yeah!

"Bottle Rocket is a really good film at times.  At other times?  Slow, repetitive, and boring.  But it absolutely showcases the director that Wes Anderson was to become, albeit with a little less of the style we've come to expect from him.

The romance between Anthony & Inez is really sweet.  And Dignan is fun.  And I get an almost Coen Brothers feel from some of the tertiary characters like Bob's brother.

Unfortunately, it felt rather amateurish. The facets that make Anderson's other movies so satisfying are not very well fleshed-out here.  Perhaps the obvious shoestring budget played a large role in it, but I didn't sense a strong conviction in the direction of the film.  The script has some nice lines and some funny quirks, but not much resolve.  Like some other reviewers, I just couldn't get why Anthony kept letting Dignan drag him into such clearly stupid plans.

The reality was somewhat less. (I'm afraid to watch Rushmore again--it lives in my Top 10 comedy list.) The flaws were certainly there, and they made me cringe far too many times. Is it the 13 years older I am? Can't be sure, but as many other 3 star reviewers say, this was a dress rehearsal of better things to come, with many fine touches. But it eventually left me cold; Dignan was a massively unpleasant guy, and why he would command anyone's loyalty is beyond me. Everyone in this film was just a little too dim to make me want to watch.

"Bottle Rocket is about 3 guys' adventure on how they live out part of their lives ""making a living"" by stealing from others.  The movie slowly climaxes, then dives at a different angle to a slow point where the three characters, Anthony, Bob, and Dignan don't talk to each other for about 20 minutes of the movie. This slowness takes away from the humor aspects of the movie because it drags too long.  Otherwise the humor before this portion is as charming and crass as watching I Heart Huckabees.  The build up of the movie afterward is funny in a weird way, but not too many people would probably think that Michael lusting for almost non-English speaking hotel maid Anita was funny.  They might think it was just plain dumb.  Brothers Luke and Owen really portray their talented acting as you really feel they are the characters they play.  Owen Wilson's character's crazy obsessing with trying to plan crimes as a mastermind, and being very good at it.  Luke Wilson's character's as someone who just usually follows his friend Dignan along because he doesn't really know where he's headed in life.",3.0

All the trademarks are there, just a little rougher in timing and delivery.",3.0
"My thoughts on Seeing Taxi Driver,the film itself is complicated to explain,yes there is Intense Violence and you have someone who is not well,on the other hand You sort of have De Niro's Character and the Loneliness come through Raw and Gritty,I would call it a Gritty Street Film Not ART or A ""Masterpiece"",It certainly was not meant to Be Pleasant. Certainly Cannot Condone such behavior,I was skeptical because I thought maybe it was a Political Statement at the time on Guns and Violence as usual from a Hollywood Liberal Perspective,and it might be in a way in some sort of hidden meaning. It also just so happens De Niro is a Vietnam Vet in the movie or former marine so the Stigma and ""Political Jab"" may or may not be there for some including myself. I do not view it as a Classic but It is Eerie,And De Niro certainly pulled it off.",3.0
"I decided I had to get this movie based on all of the hype of an Oscar winner and a De Niro defining role after hearing that my new boss was named Hinkley.  A co-worker asked if that was the same name as the man who attempted to assassinate Reagan.  After looking up the Reagan assassination attempt and finding out it was Hinckley, rather than Hinkley, I also re-learned about his obsession with Jodie Foster in this movie and how it led to the assassination attempt.  She won (I was going to say earned, but not so much) an Oscar for her role in this movie and it has become a ""modern classic"".

Overall, the story was nothing more than okay - a loner who is torn between his disgust of the seedier side of New York City and his inability to not be consumed by it.  His ""relationships"" with Cybill Shepard (very young and demure here) and Foster are at best superficial and barely explored.  The movie relies on a warped soundtrack that I was tempted to mute and go to subtitles because it was so annoying and the unusual cityscape of New York to propel it forward.  There was virtual no useful dialogue and none of the characters seemed to have any idea what they wanted or why they were where they were.

How Foster was even noticed by the Academy is a shock - she couldn't have been on screen for more than 6 minutes.  She was convincing enough as a young prostitute, but not at all compelling or memeroble in my opinion.  De Niro did a fine job as a near-lunatic ex-marine and he looked the part with a chisled body, but his headlong no-holds barred pursuit of Shepard in her office was completely out of character and not believable.  Even more unbelievable was that he would simply not be interested in her later in the movie, given where he was at that particular point in his life.

For her part, Shepard was not much more than eye-candy.  She was a necessary plot link between the streets of new York and the good Senator, but in the end served no greater purpose than that.

The climactic shoot-out was the only highlight in the movie and that's only if you can stomach some rather brutal imagery that makes you feel like you were there.  During the shootout, I wasn't really sure what I wanted the outcome to be.

While I haven't seen all of the ""special"" features what I have seen so far was pretty plain vanilla fare with little to no great insight.  ""It was a movie that we had to make.""  ""We didn't think anyone would watch it.""  ""We really didn't talk much about what it meant, we all just knew.""  It sounded as if they were just going through the motions.

Bottom line, I'm glad I watched it just to know what it was and to see the original ""You talkin' to me?"" scene, but definitely not a top-notch movie in my opinion.",3.0
"Anybody reading this has probably already seen the movie, but...

This is a fun little movie based around 3 guys in their mid-twenties who innocently choose to pursue a life of crime out of sheer boredom.

Owen Wilson is brilliant as Dignan...an insecure character with a strong desire to be a criminal mastermind. He recruits his best friend Anthony (Luke Wilson) to be his right hand man and take down some scores together. Bob joins the ""gang"" as the getaway driver, which makes sense since he is the only one with a car.

I would consider this an Owen Wilson movie moreso than a Wes Anderson film because Owen carries this movie in every scene. Any scene without Dignan tends to drag along (the whole Anthony/Ines relationship really slows down the flow).

I give this 4 STARS minus one for the bare bones DVD. No commentary, no deleted scenes, we don't even get to see the original short film version of Bottle Rocket that was shopped around and eventually led to the feature length.

I would bet money that the Criterion Collection picks this DVD up and re-releases it properly. Hold out if you can...",3.0
"Bottle Rocket isn't a bad movie, but it's not a particularly good one either.  The biting satire present in Anderson's later films, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, isn't quite there in this one making the absurdities of the characters in Bottle Rocket less appealing.  The basic moral premis in this film is the same as all Anderson's other movies--Failure and Redemption, but it's not executed as well, and it's not nearly as funny.",3.0

"This movie is very powerful and is certainly deserving of its Top 100 AFI rating.  This is the story of madness and the slow decent into criminal violence that it leads Taxi Driver Bickle when he sees it as the only way out of a hopeless situation.  Loneliness can be a terrible thing to deal with and while most people struggle with it and choose a more conventional and healthy solution others with mental illness or who are prone to it ""choose"" different paths that may lead to self-destruction or as in the case of Travis Bickle, vigilante-ism and taking the law into his own hands to set things ""right.""  The lonely angry psychopath who reacts in this way is the ticking time bomb that unfortunately is almost never recognised until the effects of their madness come to fruition e.g. the Unabomber etc.  DeNiro does an excellent job in portraying this individual and is genuinely scary in his role; even scarier is the realisation that perhaps at some point in our lives the vast majority of us have at least contemplated taking things into our own hands and so to some extent perhaps even identify and even find ourselves rooting for Travis.  The violent end may have shocked 70s audiences and you get the sense that Scorcese even toned it down a little for fear of a public backlash but it's interesting to me that as violence in film has been getting worse and worse over the years, I felt that it was pretty tame given what we are exposed to these days e.g ""Kill Bill"", ""Blade"" etc and I thought the final scenes were not violent enough relative to today's films.  Ironically, Bickle is treated as a hero and is not punished for his murders in the end which is also interesting as this ticking time bomb is released into the streets in an ominous ending which leaves us expecting a sequel of some sort.  I would like to see a Director's Cut of this movie and to see how Scorcese would ""modernise"" this brilliant film for today's audiences.  In my opinion, this is the best film since ""Midnight Cowboy"" to expose the seady side of the 70s New York City underbelly although it is just as powerful a film for its impact on its audience.

This dvd version of the film though is a bit of a mixed bag as although the picture and sound quality have been cleaned up the sound quality in 2 channels isn't very good and I'm glad that in the newer 2-Disc and upcoming Blu-ray versions you'll get the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound option which I hope sounds much better than what we get here.  The picture quality isn't perfect as a few frames here and there have spots and other imperfections on them but I thought it was done well enough to not detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.  The Special Features includes a good making-of documentary with interviews with Scorcese and the cast.

Overall this is a great study into the lone, crazed anti-hero and is certainly one of the better films that I've ever seen.  You may however want to give this particular dvd version a miss and go instead for either the Blu-ray or the other 2-disc standard version with the improved sound quality.

Updated 1 July 2011: 4 stars.

Amazon won't let me review this separately and so I'll do it here.  The blu-ray release of this wonderful Scorcese classic is a treat for fans as it certainly improves upon the dvd release that I reviewed above.  The digipak packaging with a number of colour postcards is very nice.  The all important picture and sound quality have also improved a great deal although the picture quality isn't perfect as there is still excessive grain in some parts especially in the scene in the brothel when DeNiro first speaks with Foster as well as in other spots but it is still an improvement over the dvd.  The sound quality is now in excellent surround mode and is the aspect most improved over the dvd version.

Not perfect picture quality-wise but still worth the double-dip.

Recommended!",3.0
"This is one of those 70's flicks that meant to shock the audience, and it did...back then. ""Taxi Driver"" is slowly-paced, pondering at times, and very self-indulgent, in particular one scene in with Martin Scorsese stating how he's going to kill his cheating wife.

It seemed some parts were waaaaaaaaaay too dragged on while other parts(such as the ROBBERY itself) could have been viewed by the audience alot longer. You should see this one atleast once!",3.0
"The film gets 3.5 stars, the DVD 2. (Hey Wes, no commentary? You knew we'd be scrambling for Bottle Rocket once Rusmore was released...)
This film is like a Wes Anderson dress rehersal. It has the same off-beat characterization, unique camera work, and moments of hilarity. But it's clearly Anderson's vision in the incubation stage--the film left me wanting, like watching a short that was unnaturally stretched to feature length.
Owen Wilson plays Digan wonderfully, the man just not smart enough to become a master criminal. In fact, his entire view of the world is so contrived once senses that he was inspired to a life of crime by watching an A&E special. His sidekicks are equally clueless, but lack Dignan's near-insane commitment to a life of crime.
The narrative however is weakned by the love story, however charming and sweet. Luke Wilson's character--somewhat indecisive and melancholy to begin with--suddenly comes across like your typical schnook from a John Hughes movie.
The strength of the movie lies in the Big Caper and all the planning (and botches) that precede it. James Caan was brilliant as the local boss and would-be kingpin, who tries to give the boys from Plano a little taste of reality.
It reminds me a lot of another very funny, young Texan road flick: Fandango. But unlike this Kevin Costner predecessor, Bottle Rocket tends to wander, and lacks a lot of genuine emotion. Overall, it's a respectable debut film and is interesting to see the earlier fruits of Wes Andersons's creativity. As far as 1990s indie films go, you could do much worse...
I recommend renting it first and watching it more than once before buying.",3.0
"I can see why people love this movie and why others hate it. Taxi Driver is a mixed bag for me, parts of the film I find interesting but there are some slow and boring sections for me as well. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor, this is his defining role. Jodie Foster is also good as well, she plays a young streetwalker and De Niro's character tries to save her from a life on filth and suffering. The ending is pretty good but I still unsatisfied with the whole film, it's an unique flick but not a classic, I prefer Raging Bull instead.",3.0
"this is a great set BUT there is an edit to the film which, for the life of me, I cannot understand on any level.

The funny thing is I watched it with the Paul Schrader commentary and you'd think he'd notice lines of his own dialogue which were now missing.

Anyway, the scene where Travis takes Iris up to her room -- the guy who rents the room (also featured in Scorsese's Mean Streets) tells Travis something like to ""leave your gun cowboy"" and then when Travis and Iris leave and guy says he will be timing them, you can clearly see the gun in the guy's hand even though the earlier the dialogue was missing.

Then when Travis returns, the guy is carrying Travis' gun up to him to return it but you can barely see it this time -- shot seems shorter and I had to freeze-frame it to even see the gun this time -- and his line about it is gone and suddenly Travis gives him the $20 and says ""this is for you...spend it well"" or something.

I watched this scene a few times and even checked the script (also on the disc) and the scene, or rather the lines and bits of the scene, are gone despite being referenced in the script.

This is one of my favorite films of all time and I've seen it on its original release at the drive-in, edited on TV, on cable, and on videotape and am sure those lines were in the film.

Please could someone out there explain this for me?

Is this some kind of retro-tinkering like Lucas did with Star Wars and Spielberg did with E.T.?

"After reading all the glowing reviews here on Bottle Rocket I decided to check it out.  I'm glad I rented rather than purchased it because while it does have its amusing parts (often nicely understated and in the background), it is not one I'm likely to see again.
It didn't seem as funny or as quirky to me as many of the other reviewers seemed to think (yes, I do watch non-mainstream movies and think I got the jokes/lines in this one).  I thought Rushmore was a better movie in the line of dark, quirky movies (though still not 5 stars either).
That being said, there *were* some funny lines in the movie, an interesting house, and of course Lumi Cavazos can do no wrong (as the motel housekeeper -- she also played Tita in Like Water for Chocolate).
So...  I'd put it in the ""worth watching if you see a lot of movies"" category, but not one for the library..",3.0
"I was very dissapointed by this Martin Scorsese film. It had the good actors, the good plot, but seemed just weird. Without all of the necessary pieces, it ends out being an average movie. De Niro plays a cabbie who drives nonstop becomes he can't sleep as he is haunted by memories of Vietnam. He then falls for a woman played by Cybil Sheppard as well as later falls for a prostitute played by a young Jodie Foster.

De Niro's character is driven to madness and buys guns so that he can save Foster from her kidnappers. He gets a mohawk and has some classic lines like ""you talking to me?"". But, ultimately, I was bored by this movie that just seemed to go nowhere. I was lost at some moments and didn't even really realize that he was trying to save Foster at the end. I knew it because he had given her money for her to flee but the scene comes out of nowhere and is very brutal, bloody and unnecessary. This movie felt like a waste of my time and I was very dissapointed.

On the other hand, everyone else seems to love this movie. I guess I just don't understand this because the movie felt boring to me and just unnecessary.

But, I'm sure that no one will listen to me as I'm different than all of the other reviews and I'm the guy that fell asleep during two viewing of Alien. ( It wasn't nightime)

"Luke Wilson (Home Fries) stars in this wacky tale of 3 idiot would-be theives. It's like dumb and dumber turn to crime. Some of the jokes are funny, like when they are at a motel and yelling back and forth from the  balcony to the pool about how they need to hide their identity. An  interesting turn comes when hiding out at that same motel, Luke's character  discovers a beautiful maid from Paraguay. He falls instantly in love with  her even though they don't speak the same language. I would have liked this  story to progress further, but instead the trio leave to go on to further  theivery.

Its kind of like SCARFACE in the way that everybody says you HAVE to see it. So I was expecting a lot more than I got. Its a pretty good movie all the way up until the ridiculous ending. The blood looks like ketchup! I can't help but compare it to SCARFACE which had more blood and gore, but was believable. The ending of this movie just wasn't good enough for me. The acting was good all around. I almost didn't recognize Jodi Foster as the young prostitute. My point is that even if a movie sucks the ending can still save it, but this movie was good until the ending which really annoys me.

"Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) has a big problem - and not just one. He's a seemingly ordinary New York cabbie who?s stalking one woman, Betsy (Cybil Shepard) while playing savior to another, Iris (Jodie Foster). But ol' Trav' is just a few coins short of a full meter, a neurotic oversight that will allow him to turn vigilante, threaten the political reelection campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) and blow away Iris?s pimp/drug dealer (Harvey Keitel). Suffice it to say, ""Taxi Driver"" is not your feel good movie of the summer. It is a cinematic snapshot of 70s pop culture gone horribly awry, with its crack and whore infested streets, its unstable social setting for easy scores and cheap sex, and a seething underbelly of corruption and dismal isolation as its acrid palette for moral decay. Travis? slow spiral into becoming the loner with a purpose is predicated upon warping the old adage and precedent that one man can make a difference. But when that one man is touched by his own sexual and financial inadequacies, his psychotic inability to bond with another human being and his self delusion - that he is on par with a deity, above the rest of humanity and the law ? then the difference he can make is between destroying himself and bringing about the next apocalypse.
Martin Scorsese directs adeptly enough, drawing the viewer into this dark world of unsettling realities. The irony of the ending seems somewhat strained and rather a bit like the happy ending tack on associated with conventional Hollywood wisdom, but there is the frightening prospect that with a return to normalcy, Travis? alter ego is, like many a volcano, merely dormant, not dead, and destined to erupt in the future.

The transfer from Columbia is a rather disappointing remastering effort. There are moments when the color is bold, if dated, and moments when fine detail is generally realized to good effect. But the bulk of this video presentation is riddled with excessive grain ? both film and digital, a barrage of compression artifacts, a lot of aliasing, some tiling, and a considerable amount of edge enhancement. Night scenes break apart with pixelization and exhibit a very muddy color scheme. There's plenty of age related dirt and grit to further detract from your viewing experience. The audio has been remastered - but just barely - with low to no bass and a really screechy high end that betrays the original mono elements. Extras include a 70 minute making of documentary with interviews featuring the director and principle cast, a photo montage, still gallery, theatrical trailer and storyboard sequences.",3.0
"NIL BY MOUTH is a film that focusses on domestic violence, alcoholism and day-to-day life in a working class area of London.
Actor Gary Oldman directed this film and it is very raw in parts, and hard to watch.
The main problem with the film is that it takes too long for anything to really happen.  In addition, too much time is devoted to the character of Bill (who is quite an uninteresting character).
The film really only pulls you in when the big guy starts beating up his wife.  This is of course extremely sad to watch but lifts you from the dullness of the film.  I was just about to nod off when this scene happened.
Overall the film fails, because it relies on violence to make it the slightest bit interesting.",3.0

"During the 70's most of us were just trying to get into something.  Taxi Driver gave us the deep hole side of something gotten into.  Realizing that perfectionism was an ideal and not necessarily  a icon to live by.  Robert Deniro demonstrated a surreal exploration into the minds ability to  take you where you really want to go.  We see a sdubtle begining and the  effects of  lost efforts and misguided youth turning into the  last chance  at saving if not one own soul than atleast a soul that is considered worth  saving.
  In these times we reflect more on not taking advantage of  youth.  Yet youth begins it's advantage of the moment and forgiveness for  innocence.  There a many Taxi Drivers in todays youth.  But the real  vocus is not the redemtion but the brutality of the event and then the  redemption",3.0

The first 2/3 of the movie was a bit boring but then it picked up markedly over the last 1/3 with some great 80's gore just oozing charm and turns into a pretty fun campy horror that still holds up well today.,3.0

"Meet Jerry Dandridge(Chris Sarandon). He's sweet, sexy, and he likes to sleep in late. You might think he's the perfect neighbor, but before inviting Jerry in for a nightcap, there's just one thing you should know. Jerry prefers his drinks warm, red and straight from the jugular! It's FRIGHT NIGHT, a horrific howl starring Chris Sarandon as the seductive vampire and Billy Ragsdale as the frantic teenager struggling to keep Jerry's deadly fangs out of his neck.

Only 17-year-old Charley Brewster (Billy Ragsdale) knows Jerry's bloodcurdling secret, but when Charley can't get anybody to believe him, he turns to TV horror host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), who used to be the ""Great Vampire Killer"" of the movies. Can these mortals save Charley and his sweetheart Amy (Amanda Bearse) from the wrathful bloodsucker's toothy embrace? If you love being scared, FRIGHT NIGHT...will give you the nightmare of your life.

This horror flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 12 going on 13 years old in the 7th grade during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1985.",3.0
"This is a popcorn movie, don't expect something original. Don't expect something that makes sense. The only thing you'll have to worry about, is the action...and come on, this movie is packed up with action, blood, scary zombies and the godess Milla Jovovich(Seen in some other great movies like `The fifth element' and `Joan of Arc').
The Cast:
Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez and Eric Mabius. A great cast.
Young, pretty and talented.
Michelle Rodriguez(From `Girlfight' and `The fast and the furious') is Rain, one of the 3 females of the SWAT group.
She's rude, violent, strong and still hot. This girl knows how to kick hard.
Milla Jovovich is Alice, she losted her memorie and can't remember what was her mission.
She's so beautiful, and she knows how to kick hard too.
Eric Mabius is Matt(I think it was Matt), he was found with Alice inside the mansion, the SWAT team thinks he's undercover.
He can't fight, but he can win Alice's hart.
The story:
Alice wakes up inside a Rocoon City mansion. When a SWAT team enters the mansion, she realizes that they are getting ready to enter The Hive.
The Hive, is an underground laboratory that created this T virus that can bring the dead people alive.
The red queen, the Hives ""mind"" killed everybody inside.
The team's mission is to find out what happened and destroy the T Virus.
The Bad guys:
Zombies, dogs, the red queen and The Licker.
The workers of the Hive are dead, but know thanks to the virus they are hungry and walking.
The dogs were for secret experiments, now they are zombie dogs.
The Licker, one of the Hive's most secret experiments, a strange creature.
The Action:
Wow!, this movie is action for a 100 minutes.
People eating each other, dogs jumping, a lot of blood, people cut in to a million pieces, cutted off hands and heads, guns, broken necks, mutated monsters and a secret laboratory more cool than Disney Land.
Resident Evil is a good movie to watch with friends.
It's based in the famous PC game, there are a lot of differences and lot of similarities. But you'll have to watch the movie to find it out. Paul Anderson is a great director, the camera loves him. He also made that bad video game movie called Mortal Kombat.
Resident Evil is pure fun, lots of blood, action and braindead people.
If you don't like this kind of movies, you can still watch Milla Jovovich.
RESIDENT EVIL

"""SLC Punk"" is a shallow good time disguised as a sociological study. While seeming to laude the tenets of both anarchy and punk rock, the film is profoundly conservative and insulting once you dig a little deeper beneath the surface. Lillard is great, even during the obnoxious ""speaking-directly-to-the-camera"" portions, but what stands out is an underlying contempt for both punk specifically, and rebellion generally. ""I didn't sell out, I bought in."" That perhaps best sums up the sensibility behind ""SLC Punk.""

"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this vampire movie...

Fright Night (1985) is a cheesy vampire movie that blends horror and humor and is straight from the heart of the 1980s.  The best performance is by Roddy McDowall, who plays a vampire hunter.  Personally, I don't really care for vampire movies that are campy.  I like my vampire movies scary and more serious, such as my all-time favorite vampire movie, Salem's Lot (1979).  Or, a lot of the Dracula movies over the years.  Some of the Hammer vampire and Dracula movies have moments of borderline cheesiness, however, it's all made up for with serious horror, scary vampires, and lots of blood.

Fright Night does not make my list of ""My Top 13 Vampire Movies"".  I would rank Fright Night probably 20-something at best.  It's a decent movie, but not one I would want to watch multiple times.  I must say, though, that it's FAR better than those horrible Twilight movies.  I would rank those Twilight movies around 224th on my list of favorite vampire movies.",3.0
"The film was OK, not a totally accurate representation of the Salt Lake post Punk and Hardcore scenes, but a nice homage.  anyway of more not. The local Salt Lake legend Sean Fightmaster, who the acid gobbling crazed character in the film was loosely based on. Passed away in December.  He was punk rock up until the last.",3.0
"now don't get me wrong..i love punk music and the cultural and ideals are very eye opening and awe inspiring, and if i were to choose myself a stereotype, it would be punk, but this movie really does nothing for me. i mean especially after seeing classics like repo man and suburbia. i mean it just doesnt capture the same atmosphere as the punk films from the 80's. to me, matt lilliard looked more like an offspring poser over an 80's true punker. heroine bob was defiantely the best character in the film.

anyways, i find this film to be more of an emotional glance at the punk scene and growing up rather than a film about beating the system to a pulp and living for the moment.  like i would say it has very little attitude of punk as the movie titanic did with the actual history of the incident.  maybe it is just the utah scene though??

anyways, if you are into movies about friendships and growing up, this movie is a definite, but if you are more into attitude of punk check out suburbia and repo man. sadly to say, this is a movie for the hot topic generation.

"I have very mixed feelings about this film. First of all, I grew up in SLC but I was just a kid in the 80's......so I was more in tune with the 90's stuff that happened. But I remembered hearing about how Shawn Fightmaster ran with the acid in his pocket and tried to kill his mom. So I think that stuff was based on real events. I really enjoyed the scenes and got all nostalgic when I saw Positively 4th Street and the parks and streets of SL. I moved to Oregon since then. Bob seemed to be the most authentic portrayal of any punks I knew. Most of the punks I knew weren't very violent and they didn't run around yelling PUNK ROCK or ANARCHY! They were artists and musicians and they were far more interesting and individual than the films half baked portrayal. Especially Stevo.......poser. Mike was interesting and seemed like more of the people I knew......people who were just themselves and not trying to live up to any label. Real punks don't call themselves punk very often.......its just the way they are. The most interesting crowd were the ones you couldn't outwardly identify anyway. Too many labels in this film. Irritating.....and I didn't buy Stevo becoming a lwayer either....but some scenes were fun....like the acid trip at the park and some of the interactions. They should have gone more into Mormon history and culture. HALF BAKED! But worth a glance and a laugh.",3.0
"Fright Night is one of the better vampire films from the 80's.  The special effects are gruesome and scary yet the movie is also sexy and fun too.  Yes it's from the 80's and it shows in a few places, but the movie still holds up very well today.  This movie was released in limited edition Blue-ray back in 2011.  The picture and sound of this edition look great.  The only thing keeping me from giving this edition 5 stars is the lack of extras.  They should have put a little more effort into this edition.  Audio commentary, deleted scenes, and retrospective interviews with the cast and film makers would have been nice.",3.0

I didn't feel like there were enough ""turning point"" scenes until the end of the movie; if they had inserted a few other key moments I think the audience would have been more invested in Matthew's character.

"Fright Night, 1985 film

This story is more of a parody than a horror movie (like the classic ""Love at First Bite""). A family has new neighbors, two men in their thirties. Is there something funny about this couple? One of the men doesn't go out in the daytime. Neither seems to go to work (trust fund babies?). Then Charley sees a strange sight at night - one neighbor is a vampire! He tells his friends and the police, but who believes in vampire legends today? Charley seems to be a crank. The local TV station has old horror movies from long ago. This show is called ""Fright Night"". The host is Peter Vincent, a former actor. Charley contacts the host of this show because he knows how to fight vampires. [You won't find ""Vampire Killers"" listed in your local Yellow Pages.]

And so the story runs on about ridding the neighborhood of these undesirable characters. The police can't help, there is no zoning law against vampires in that city. [What about your town?] There is a complication with Charley's girlfriend. Will Amy be attacked and bitten to turn her into a vampire? If so, can she be saved by killing that vampire before sundown? There is a lot of scary action. Can Peter Vincent succeed in killing that vampire, like he did on those old shows? Of course, the good guys win in the end. You will be amused and entertained by this low-budget comic horror movie if you are not too picky about its story. Was any animal hurt in this movie?",3.0

"Set in the year 1985, SLC (Salt Lake City) Punk stars Matthew Lillard as Stevo, one of two punks caught in the heart of conservatism in Salt Lake City, or Salt Lake Sh*tty, as they would say.
Never being a big fan of Lillard (Scooby Doo, Wing Commander, Scream), I waited nearly two years before picking this movie up.  I have to say I was impressed by his portrayal of Stevo, along with the rest of the movie.
Many of the ideals of punk are explored, a lot of times in narrative, such as anarchy, rebellion, fighting, drugs, changing the system, sell outs, poseurs, music, and random chaos.  I really didn't get a sense of the true punk scene, not like I did with Sid and Nancy, but this movie was entertaining.
Basically the movie follows Stevo and his friend, Heroin Bob around and documents their existence.  We get a view into their politics, social circles, lifestyle, relationships, and their difficulties in being a part of the counterculture in conservative America.  The film tends to bounce around somewhat erratically, but that seemed in line to me with the subject matter.  There are a number of very funny scenes, including one involving a trip to Wyoming for alcohol. Utah sells alcohol, but the sale of such spirits is highly restrictive.  I especially enjoyed the ending, even though I did see it coming, but Lillard's performance during the scene really helped to make it work.
A good supporting cast, an excellent music score, and fine direction work together to make this movie worth looking into, especially if you have any interest in the punk scene in America during the 80's.  I didn't get a sense that it was completely representative of the movement, but maybe it's not supposed to be...I don't know.
There are some decent extras, including a commentary track by the director and some of the stars, an isolated music score, a couple of trailers, production notes, and an SLC comic book (not an actual comic book, but one you can view on the screen).  Oh yeah, if you are easily offened by the liberal use of profanity, you might skip this one as the cursing comes fast and furious.",3.0
"I'll be the first to admit that though this movie may include alot of stereotypes and exaggerations, it's funny and witty. The ending is good. That's pretty much one star in my point of view. Another star for comedy, and one more for some slaps in the face. I reccomend you see it, but you won't miss too much if you don't.",3.0
"""SLC Punk!"" is one of the better Indie films I have watched, the ""plot"" keeps you hooked, the moral at the end is good, and the characters (for the most part) are believable. Certain charcters add only a small gimmick value to the film, such as Sean, the acid dealing punk, who is in an unfortunate acid accident. There are several humouristic lines, in particular the scene where the protagonist, Stevo, is rambling on about England. This film is worth taking a chance on, but is not the best Indie film there is. Parents be advised, sever drug usage and language are contained.",3.0
"cult movie. I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it was originally released in the late 80s. I had to have it to compare it to the upcoming remake to be released on August 19, 2011. I can only hope with today's technology, the remake will surpass the original.",3.0
"Horror movies are not really my thing, but this movie kept my attention and was pretty entertaining for the most part. Of course it's an older movie so don't expect a lot of special effects or anything. I like older movies (by older I mean 1980's), but if you don't happen to like older movies then maybe this wouldn't be a good choice for you.  I personally remember being scared out of my mind from some other 1980's movies like Friday the 13th and especially Nightmare on Elm Street, but for some reason this one wasn't like that for me. So, overall it was pretty entertaining, but, not that scary.",3.0

The special effects were pretty good for their time and most of the actors were good too. The story is still entertaining, although 15 minutes should have been cut out through-out the movie. The constant need to convince everybody that a) the neighbor is a vampire, and b) they need to kill the neighbor dragged on and got kinda tired. Then there's the whole dance club scene that killed the flow of the movie for me. It just went on for far too long. Then there's the Evil Ed character, I don't remember him being nearly as annoying as he is to me now. But then again, Sesame Street isn't annoying when you're a kid either. Overall it's a decent movie, nothing amazing, but nothing terrible. If you want to see a movie that still stands the test of time watch Night Of The Creeps or Maximum Overdrive. Those movies have stayed favorites as long as I can remember.",3.0
"Fright Night is an enjoyable horror.  Its fast paced simple story keeps you watching as to how a young teenager tackles the fact that a vampire has moved in next door to him.  Fright Night is a very predictable 80's horror flick with bubbly performances from its teenager stars and the over exaggerated acting from its adult leads.  Don't get me wrong, the acting IS acceptable for this type of film and works well.  Keeping to the theme of the film, strange things start to happen (for example): a coffin is seen brought into the house next door, a mysterious man is seen with a woman and a body in a bag is seen dragged out of the house.  Of coarse this all leads up to one thing, that there is a vampire living in the next house and the frightened tenager tries to warn everybody before the vampire kills again.  It not surprising what happens next, as the vampire visits and fights back (but for some strange reason) with comedic effect.

Fright Night does have a lot of ridiculous but humerous moments with 80's style make up and special effects.  The special effects however, are quite good and impressive for its time.  Eventhough this film is very enjoyable and a good Halloween flick, it does have a couple of flaws.  One is that the story is very simple and dreary, while the second is that some parts of the film could have been done better.

Overall, Fright Night is a forgetable film but it is very entertaining and fun to watch.  Its a film I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could.  So I gave it 3, as it will take me a while to watch again.",3.0
"This movie looks like an MTV produced video concentrating on just how cynical and violent punk rockers are , not to mention the main character a rich college boy with blue hair. This film tries to say all punks do is drink beer , smoke pot , and beat up rednecks. Plus Stev-O rambles on and on and on about anarchy and rebellion . Can someone please tell me just what he was being so rebellious against? or just what anarchist principles did he hold?. It is a good film to sit down and watch , discuss , and laugh at , but it really does nothing more than streotype punks ..also it jerks your emotions around constantly from a funny satire , to an emotional study of self discovery. In the end Steve-O becomes what he complains about through the whole film..nothing more than a poser all along ..at least he admitted it.",3.0
"my feelings on this excellent movie are mixed.  on the one hand it is about ten times better than the worthless explosion movies that dominate theatres today, but on the other hand it is a sell out movie in the sense that it discourages youthful questioning and rebellion.  while it is true that senseless rebellion, directed at nothing in particular and just angry for the sake of being angry, is not real rebellion at all, it seems self evident to me that the person who recognizes society and traditional ways of life for what they are, i.e. death traps and ridiculously absurd, will come to the conclusion that nonconformism and rebellion of the authentic kind, individual and philosophical, is perhaps the only way to a happy existence of any kind. the 'realism' represented by the main character's father is not by any means a recognition of the true state of things, but is rather a weak submission to a commodified and insane world.  so in that sense i can only call this movie an active encouragement to conformity, and therefore despicable.",3.0
"My kids found this movie amusing and, reading the reviews here, I'm wondering if I'm the only one who thought this was not a very good vampire flick. I liked the story line but the acting in some cases (Stephen Geoffreys and Chris Sarandon) was quite shoddy. I loved the ""seduction"" music and was a bit ticked when I bought the tape and found it a vocal instead of the sexy sound I heard in the movie.

William Ragsdale was quite good as Charlie, all hormones and teenage lust, and still fairly normal in spite of his dingbat mother. Amanda Bearse is sweet. I liked her maturing transformation on the dance floor. In fact, this is Sarandons one good moment in the film. The dance is all about seduction and he does an incredible job. As long as he isn't trying to actually spout lines he does all right. Stephen Geoffreys was bloody awful and I do not find it a mystery that I've seen him in nothing since.  Johathan Stark as the modern day ""Igor"" is very, very good. A great addition to a small budget film and I wouldn't mind seeing him in other things, he was that believable.

Roddy McDowall is not a great film actor. Maybe he is better on the stage, I don't know. However, he gives an adequate performance here as PETER VINCENT, VAMPIRE KILLER. I think Vincent Price (who I adore and who was also NOT a great actor), could have had a ball in this role and it's a shame that he didn't get the chance to try. Regardless, McDowall also has some fun here and he is amusing to watch.

To me, this is a nice old vamp flick, good with popcorn and a group of teenie-boppers. I don't think the older teens will like the lack of special effects and adults will see the lack of acting talent.  Great to rent, good to buy only if you get a good deal on the price.",3.0
"Punk--at least as it is portrayed in the media--became cliche a long time ago, so the scenes that are intended to show us the punk movement in general terms, such as the party and concert scenes, seemed somewhat passe.  This film's strengths lie in its specifics--the characters and the performances--rather than its portrayal of the milieu they inhabit.  Matthew Lillard is great as Stevo, an achiever who can't find a constructive way to channel his energies, filled with anger about the hypocrisy of the mainstream world he must one day join.  Michael Goorjian is also very good as Heroin Bob, a gentle non-conformist who is terrified of illicit substances.
Although I was never a punk myself, it seems to me that this isn't really a punk movie since it depicts the scene as a way station on the road to either dying or putting on a suit.  For a film with a more subversive attitude, check out ""Repo Man.'",3.0

Even the gay 80s clothes and Cosby-esque sweaters could not take away from his deliciousness. He is in almost no other movies, so I watch this one at least once a year. This vampire is smokin hot right down to his great, evocative voice. Bite me, I'm yours, baby.",3.0
"This is a high-energy youth angst movie, set in 1980s Salt Lake City. Matthew Lillard is Stevo, protagonist punk and narrator. The movie basically tracks his post-college life in SLC as he tries to define just  who the hell he is, along with his long-time buddy, Heroin Bob (who's one of the only characters with even an iota of credibility to him, especially when stacked up with Stevo -- incidentally, the Steve-o from ""Jackass"" and ""Wildboyz"" is infinitely more hardcore than Lillard's Stevo -- hell, for the little poserkids out there, watch ""Jackass"" to get a better understanding of it!)

Without  wanting to spoil much of this movie, because it really is a lot of fun, I  have to say that I think that Stevo's father IS the screenwriter, and he's  confronting his younger self in this movie, and reconciling his lifestyle  choices. There are patchwork references to anarchism and punk throughout  this movie, but for anybody who knows about either of these areas, it's  clear that the writer doesn't get it. How do I put this: it's a punk movie  for posers, or for people who don't know jack about punk.

How do I know  this? Well, it's clear that Stevo is a shirtsleeve rebel from the start;  only people who put a lot of faith in appearances and lifestyles could  possibly believe he's anything but that (I mean, he mall-rants at length about how US hardcore is so much better than UK punk, but their punky party van has the Subhumans and PiL spraypainted on it -- hello??)

All the punk stereotypes/cliches appear in  this movie - dyed hair, mohawks, leather jackets, and so forth. But anybody  who really gets punk should know that there isn't a look to it, not if  you're for real - nobody should look like a punk, or look like an  anarchist; punk was about anti-fashion, about genuine nonconformity, about  being yourself; anarchism is about self-expression and liberation. This is only practiced by two of the characters, and is pointed out by another. The  rest are charlatans, and they don't even know it. I blame the screenwriter for ""Cashing In"" on punk's popularity at the time.

Because I knew Stevo was full of (sh)it from the beginning, his journey's end came as no surprise to  me, his ""revelation"" wasn't revelatory. Still, it's an enjoyable  journey, anyway. The soundtrack of this movie is excellent, despite the movie it's wrapped around.",3.0
"Chris Sarandon is terrific as Jerry Dandridge, the charming neighborhood vampire. In watching his performance one evening after I bought this tape, I finally understood why it was that the vampire story will never die, no matter how many stakes get driven into its heart: the near-death ecstasy and the orgasmic ecstasy are biochemically identical. Whether it is the act of creating human life or the act of taking it away- the human physical response is the same.  With the tale of the vampire, when the male vampire is in the act of ostensibly making love to his victim, we get both actions [ostensibly giving and taking] the same time.  The raw power of the scene in the book, ""Dracula,"" where the vampire baptizes Mina with his own blood, adds a third element to this powerful biochemical mix: a spiritual element, a religious esctasy.  We don't have this in ""Fright Night"", but instead we have the setting of an entirely normal central character and his friends, in an average town in Anywhere, America.  This ""brings it home"" in an unexpected way, as the spiritual aspect is replaced by a social one.  Context is the difference, one which is exploited very well.  And of course, the struggle of a fatherless boy trying to grow into manhood and the man finds himself fixating on [the vampire] adds another dimension.  The vampire has been a man and moved beyond it; Charley wants to be a man and finds that he is both helpless and threatened by the vampire.  And of course, the vampire is just as helpless under certain conditions and threatened by almost everything in the ordinary daylight world- Charley through the looking glass.
Roddy McDowell shines in his role as the washed-up B-movie star.  The supporting cast is also very good.  And the music isn't even bad-- very 80's, but this adds to its charm.",3.0

But it is a great  vampire movie. The storyline is about a teenager witnessed a murder next  door which he believes done by a vampire. Of course nobody else believes  him. It is fun, funny and scary. If only someone release the sequel on DVD  also. The sequel is very much an equal to the original which is rare this  days.",3.0
"I love this movie!  The darkened scenes, the innocent virgin and the hokey out-of-work vampire slayer make up a movie that will entertain through the  decades to come.  Chris Sarandon plays a devastatingly sexy yet  non-compassionate vampire, determined to punish the naive next door  neighbor, Bill Ragsdale, the hottie from Herman's Head, for spying on his  nighttime habits.  The 80s music and disco sequence, along with the  antediluvian costumes, go a long way to making this movie enjoyable both  for the thrill of the hunt and the inevitable reminiscence of the decade in  which it was made.  Although it conforms to a specific 80s pattern, it has  held up through time.  Enjoy!",3.0

"Resident Evil is such a hot mess
Originally given to the Father of modern zombie George A. Romero (Go out of your way and read his script it was a bit different but, much better then what we got in the end)
The studio double crossed Romero and found a cheaper more lazy director/writer in Paul W.S. Anderson
Who would take the Resident Evil ""Brand"" down a deep dark hole where it needs to be buried once and for all
This is not a Resident Evil adaption it's a cheap action film with lots of terrible CGI F/X's and no real connection to the source material
Milla Jovovich character Alice doesn't even exist in the games
The only major highlight of this film is a naked Milla Jovovich but, she's a former eastern European model she'll get naked at the drop of a hat!
Anderson and Jovovich would get married after filming this so-called horror film  which would lead to the character of Alice taking over the Resident Evil Universe and pretty much be the face of these movies
You gotta love Hollywood  nepotism

"I found this action/SF/horror/zombie flick inspired by the video game ""Resident Evil"" quite watchable and entertaining, although it is really not a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Deep underneath Raccoon City exists a large, secret genetic research facility called the Hive, owned by the Umbrella Corporation. The whole site is controlled and managed by an artificial intelligence called the Red Queen. At the very beginning of the movie SOMETHING happens which makes the Red Queen seal the Hive and start killing everyone inside.

Exactly at the same moment an attractive young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in a deserted mansion - bruised, naked and unable to remember jack... Then she realises the manor is not as deserted as it first looked... And then the film really begins.

Well, as adaptations of video games go, this one is better than most and actually it is a pretty decent action film. Personally, I never liked much zombie flicks (with the only exception being the old black and white classic ""Night of Living Dead"") but this one is quite watchable. Action scenes are not bad, there are some rather good (sometimes pretty cruel) twists, Milla Jovovich is very sexy and Michelle Rodriguez offers a great performance as a Very Macho Commando Girl With Big B@lls Of Fire...))) Also, the Red Queen is a pretty interesting villain.

On another hand dialogs are not so great and there is little humour. Even if there are some twists the whole story is rather predictable and the ending, albeit necessary for the already then planned sequel, is really silly.

Bottom line, this is a honest action/SF/horror/zombie flick, mostly enjoyable because of two main actresses - but it is nothing more and I don't think I will keep the DVD for future viewings. Still, a honest watch, especially recommended for viewing after a very hard day at work, when one is simply too tired to think much and just needs something to go nicely with beer.",3.0

"This is the second installment in the Resident Evil movie series and yet again it has been overdone. I've been a long time veteran of the games and have been very disappointed with how the directors brought it to the big screen. While the series is action packed and entertaining, the characters and their personalities are smeared all over the floor and they've reached too far to other crowds who probably aren't familiar with the series. After seeing the first film, I was apprehensive but still interested in seeing Apocalypse. I think they did a great job creating Nemesis and he was the best part of this film by far. Unfortunately the side story is mediocre and they totally destroyed all of the Resident Evil 3 characters I played as and loved. Jill Valentine (known as ""Valentine"" here) in the game is a cool, collected, smart gal with a pretty good intuition. In this movie she is a macho, loud-mouthed, jealous girl who lacks a warm personality and cusses up a storm. She's like Jill's evil twin sister. Carlos is a likeable character but he's totally an American in this movie. Both Nicolai and Mikhail (they call him something else in the movie) die very early on. Alice has always been exclusive to the film series, and while she is a good actress with an interesting back story, she was never in the games (to my knowledge).

The problem I have with these RE films is that they are way overdone - everybody is macho and fights to heavy metal or bad techno. It is totally to sell tickets. None of the characters share the humble qualities of inner strength and determination like in the games. There is no depth to anyone and it's hard to connect. The movie hits hard and leaves no lasting impressions. I keep thinking, ""less is more"", but that is not their philosophy - they want it all out on the table and leave nothing up to the viewers to be figured out.

Good as entertainment for an hour and a half, but definitely not true to the series, nor does it do the games justice. You must turn part of your brain off and forget everything you know about the Resident Evil games to enjoy this flick.",3.0

"Four stars for screenplay writing, technical execution and acting:
The well-written Oliver Stone screenplay vaulted him into his screenwriting and directing career. Likewise, the film vaulted Alan Parker who had directed commercials and several short films, into his feature film career. Brad Davis was also a first-timer in a major role and his performance was stellar, with a promising career wasted and cut short by uncontrolled drug abuse and contracting aids. Not surprising it was nominated for numerous Oscars, as the story they filmed was compelling. Unfortunately, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not often consider how a film represented to the public as a true story actually aligns with the real facts.

One Star for Gross Inaccuracy:
Granted, it wasn't a documentary, or even a docu-drama, but it was marketed as the story about William Hayes, his arrest, imprisonment, and subsequent escape. The problem is not ""artistic license"" liberties with minor details and conflation (e.g. combining characters or locations) to reduce scope and run time. The problem is the film doesn't much resemble what actually occurred other than Hayes being arrested for smuggling hashish at the airport, being tried for it, being convicted and sentenced for it, being re-sentenced to a longer prison term, and escaping to Greece some years later. Nearly everything else that fleshes out the story is a fabrication, gross exaggeration, or gross caricature. The Turkish criminal justice and prison system leaves much to be desired, and it does suffer from some corruption, but it's not nearly the kind of capricious judicial decision-making or the level of depraved, sadistic cruelty depicted in the movie. The real story isn't quite as compelling and has a tougher time garnering sympathy for the protagonist. Knowing the factual events of Hayes' arrest, trial and imprisonment, I don't have much sympathy for what he actually suffered in the Turkish prisons. He was 23 years old, knew what he was doing was a crime (and not a trivial one), and intuitively knew the punishment could be quite severe if he were caught and arrested in Turkey for smuggling roughly 2 kilos (4 pounds) of hashish. It's not drug kingpin quantity, but it's way beyond attempting to claim it was a ""personal use"" quantity. He cannot claim 18-19 year old naivety either. Nor was he coerced, cajoled or persuaded by someone else to mule the drugs for them. In short, all William Hayes' suffering was entirely self-inflicted by his own, conscious decisions. Although he had been re-sentenced from 4 years plus some months for possession to 30 years for smuggling, it's quite certain he would have been released within couple years after his escape. Nevertheless, Turkey was then and still is a country with harsh drug dealing and drug smuggling laws. Had the film been represented as a complete fiction, with fictional characters in a semi-fictional mid-east country, it would be much more acceptable. That wouldn't have marketed as well though.

This movie should be viewed as a complete fiction. On that basis it holds up as a very good adventure thriller, albeit with a very flawed protagonist. It utterly fails as any resemblance to the true story about William Hayes.",3.0

"When I first heard that they were going to make a movie based of of one of my favorite video game franchises of all time I couldn't even begin to tell you the level of excitement I felt. I began climbing the walls with impatience and counting down the days until the films release. However after I viewed the movie I felt something completely different. Confusion and dissapointment, I couldn't believe that the film makers actually had the audacity to call this 'Resident Evil'. This movie goes against everything from the first resident evil game, and even finds new ways to annoy avid fans of the once great series of resident evil games.

Instead of this movie following the Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. team an a mansion located in the Arklay mountains we instead follow a Spec Ops team hired by or created by Umbrella (I wonder why they don't just use the U.B.C.S.) a security operative, and environmentalist, and an Umbrella employee. So we are off to a pretty sad spot to begin with. This film feature zero, that is right, ZERO characters from the first resident evil game and doesn't even come close to even getting the basic premise correct. Instead of this taking place in a mansion, we are in an underground lab, instead of Jill or any other cool resident evil characters we get these, somewhat interesting, set of characters, we only get to see two B.O.W.s, and I really can't believe they did this but, they had the nerve to change the way the virus spread to Raccoon City. In the game William Burkin had just finished his work on the G-Virus when Umbrella sent mercenaries to retrieve the sample from him, morally wounding him in the process. With William's last breath he injects the g-virus into his system and attacks the mercs and destroys all viles of the g and t-virus. Some sewer rats start drinking and gnawing on the capsules and then spread the virus throughout the city. In this movie the idiot scientist decide ""hey lets jut re-open the lab that we know is filled with dangerous monsters and walkers so we can find out what happened instead of downloading the security footage from a secure location."" Surprise surprise the virus runs rampant throughout the city.

Now if the writers actually played the game, or even cared about the fans they wouldn't have had the movie end that way, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

As we journey throughout the new location (that being the underground lab) we get some really interesting scenery as we get to see locations of manufactured B.O.W.s' and even locations where they tested the T-virus and designed it. I was actually curious about where this road was taking us in terms of story, so as the Special Ops team is sent in to deactivate the lab's A.I. system they have to cut the power, which releases all of the walkers that were contained in the offices and testing room, and the group is forced to do battle. Here is where the movie actually becomes pretty interesting, sure this movie is a stab in the back to all fans of the games, however, there are still some entertaining moments of the film and this is certainly one of them. The group begin fighting the undead but are curious as to why they keep getting up no matter how many times they are shot in the torso.

*Me personally, if I shot an attacker 7 times in the chest and they just shrug it off I'm going to aim for the head. To bad these characters would rather waste ammo than use their brains.

Our survivors are then forced to fall back, but due to heavy zombie presence, are separated as the writers thankfully bring some parts of the resident evil games into this movie. What I mean by that is we get a licker, who shows up at the end of the movie, and zombie dogs. This is where I was very excited to see how authentic these B.O.W.'s would be, and they are very authentic and in fact very scary to see in a live action film.

Alice wonders into a dog kennel and when I was watching this for the first time I said to myself ""Oh please, please don't be a tease"" and this anything but. It is here that we get an immensely satisfying battle between Alice and the zombie dogs as she takes on the entire kennel and even kills that last one with a pretty cool air kick to the face.

Alice manages to regroup with Matthew and the others as they try and find a way out of the facility before they become trapped and left to die. They discover a way out through the maintenance tunnels only to get swarmed by walkers. They just barely make it out alive, but two of the remaining spec ops team members (Rain and Kaplan suffer bites and are now both infected) This is even worse for Rain as she was bitten earlier in the movie and now the infection is spreading even faster now. As they attempt to escape their current predicament one of the pipes breaks causing Kaplan to fall the zombie bit below, he survives his encounter and tells the group to leave him behind as they don't have nearly enough ammunition to kill the walkers and he is too far away for there to be any probable rescue. He unloads his revolver and realizes that he only has one bullet left, which he uses to dispose of a walker before crawling away.

It is here that the remaining members of the group (Alice,Matthew,Spence, and a very much infected Rain) journey through the labs where the virus was being tested and manufactured, it is also here that Alice remembers exactly where the cure was located as well. When they arrive to this location she discovers the cure to be missing and we find out who is responsible (it is Spence big surprise there) as he locks the group in the room after he receives a bite from a walker. He makes his way to the train where he had the cure and virus the entire time, only to die from a very hungry licker.

*I was very excited to finally see this thing actually have some significance in the movie, for the most part it just wonders around the facility teasing the fans with its presence. Though I suppose they were ultimately building up suspense for the creatures inevitable battle with the few remaining survivors.

Kaplan rejoins the group as they make their way to the train, retrieve the cure and begin administering it to the infected members of the group (Rain and Kaplan).Only to have their happy moment interrupted by a still very hungry licker. Now we get, what I have to admit is a pretty cool battle. There is almost no stopping this beast, Alice even takes Rains .45 pistol and shoots three rounds point blank into its face and all that does is piss it off. But I have to complain about this part as well. In resident evil 2 you can discover a file that describes just how dangerous this monster is. The file says how its tongue cut a man apart, yet Alice gets hit right in the face with it and all that happens is she falls on her back.

After defeating this monster the only survivors are Alice and Matthew, they make their way up to the mansion and are greeted by Umbrella scientists. Alice and Matthew are again separated and Alice regains consciousness in a hospital. She discovers that the city has been overrun and her battle is far from over.

My god this movie was disappointing, there is almost nothing recognizable about this movie. I find it highly insulting to even call this a 'resident evil'movie when so much is changed. They changed the story,characters,location, virtually everything is different. With all that has been aid I have to confess that I actually kind of like this movie. I know how it sounds but it is actually enjoyable, even with all of the flaws. I just don't understand why they call it resident evil when so much is different.",3.0
". . . years ago as a VHS rental and I had caught some of it here and there on cable television over the years.  I remember really liking this film when I saw it as a younger man.  It was supposedly cutting edge and ""gritty"" with a ""based on a true story"" aspect to it.  However- the major emotion upon seeing this film in its entirety a second time years later- was one of embarrassment.

The main character, Billy Hayes, along with the rest of the Westerners come off as nauseating egotists that I found myself having a hard time feeling much sympathy for.  The court room speech Billy Hayes delivers at his sentencing is so over the top that it is laughable.  And a later scene when his girl friend comes to visit is moronically uncomfortable to watch. And the film is quite dated.  Frankly- compared to just about any US prison- the Turkish prison presented in that film looks downright comfy and cozy with an anarchic freedom on the inside that one would never see in just about any antiseptic rigidly controlled US slam.

That being said the film is shot well and the story is capably told.  It just doesn't stand up to the test of time very well.  I'd recommend it to someone who hadn't seen it- but with heavy caveats.",3.0
"I first saw this movie not long after it's release in 1978 when I was 17 years old. Even back then I could not figure out why this guy tried to pull off this stunt in a foreign country? Or even in the USA?

It is an entertaining albeit violent piece of entertainment and the musical score is top notch.

But I have re watched this movie several times since and now in my late 40's still can't figure out what motivated this guy into thinking he should have got off scot free or even a reduced sentence for obviously & blatantly committing a crime in a foreign country no less. It's noteworthy that the real Billy Hayes was disappointed with this movie as it contains a number of errors from his side of the story & even Oliver Stone later apologized to the Turks for the not so subtle racist and anti Muslim twists this film takes.

It is a well done film but I have a difficult time feeling sympathy for the main character. Instead I see the film's version of Hayes as just another spoiled American brat expecting to find leniency for breaking the law.",3.0
"It's a sci-fi/horror-action film about a sprawling, secret undeground research facility where illegal and dangerous scientific experiments are taking place.  Naturally something goes wrong.  A SWAT team is sent in to figure out what happened.  They figure out they are in over their heads, and spend the rest of the movie fighting their way out.  That's basically it.

Insofar as these types of films go, this one isn't terrible.  It does have its strengths.  Being underground for the majority of the film, there is a creepy, middle-of-the-night atmosphere to it that kind of works (kind of).  And the lead actress, Milla Jovovich, has a certain presence that works because she manages to be tough and gorgeous at the same time.

On the other hand, there is no depth to the plot, or the characters.  The dialogue is cringe-worthy at times (e.g. ""These people used to WORK here!""), and for an action film, the action is pretty tame.  It's also worth noting that the zombies are not particularly scary.

If you are in the mood for a simple, cheap guilty pleasure to watch late at night when you can't sleep, this film is decent.  However, if you are looking for something challenging, unique, or moving, you probably won't like this movie.",3.0

The Dolby Digital 5.1 was about the best sound I have ever heard.  There was also PCM 5.1, but no DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, or Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack had better surround sound than most DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Blu-Rays.  Lot's of sub-woofer bass also.

"Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express.  Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect.  [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision].  Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans.  Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained.  Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada).  To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').

Instead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts.  It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie.  Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice.  The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil.  They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied.  There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture.  Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen.  Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film.  The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone.  Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.

The differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a ""true story"" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims.  Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: ""The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs."" and, ""I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'""",3.0
"I am a Turkish citizen with a great love of cinema.  I myself am an amateur film maker.  Like many of my Turkish friends, I liked this movie as a film production.  All the good film making elements had their good ways into this cult film, such as strong performances, cinematography, music, etc.  However, what I find unforgivable for such great film makers, like Alan Parker, Oliver Stone, David Putnam is the fact that they have been a part of a great propoganda for anti-Turkish view.  I don't believe that such avid film makers of Hollywood circle would naively didn't realise this attempt.  It is so obvious that some rich lobbies funded this film as a sheer anti-Turkish propoganda, and very successfully used such names.  This, in my view, is a black stain on all.  I would have respected it highly if they were to use both side's view on the film, and remain totally unbiased to the matter.  For once, there is no Turkish player in the film, not even a decent dubbing artists, who would have eliminated those highly visible broken Turkish accents of non-Turkish actors or dubbers.

The film starts portraying a very negative side of Turkey, showing some crude elements of Istanbul, as if Istanbul is a harsh and unforgiving Islamic town from mid ages.  Then the film moves into the tragic story of Bill Hayes, who got caught smuggling hashish or some kind of drug, which I don't know, because I never dealt with them.  The movie is full of terrible torturing scenes of a so-called Turkish prison, totally created from the twisted memories of Hayes in Malta.  I never have been prisoned, so I have no way of knowing how true was the Turkish prisons at that time.  I bet that they were not much different than of those in Greece, or US, or even from UK.  The actors playing the so-called Turkish figures, like lawyer, judge, attorney, spoke a very very broken Turkish language, full of spoken grammer mistakes.  Even the sets were created with a fanaticly anti-Turk view.  The scene where he curses to the entire Turkish nation, calling them and their mother all as ""pigs"" should be the creations of an angry anti-Turk than an acclaimed writer like Stone.  The film would probably look much nicer without such ultra-fanatic scenes.

The real story of the film was that Bill Hayes was helped for his escape by an officer in American consulate, who was an old lady, working at the Istanbul consulate.  I met her when I was working at the consulate during my college years in mid 80s.  She constructed (probably a well planned strategy with the helps of some political powers) a plan, by which Hayes was taken by the official boat of American consulate (known as Hiawatha) from the semi-open prison at one of the islands of Istanbul, and taken to Greece, and then to US.  Even at this account, Hayes was given a sort of privilidge at his stay in the prison to stay at one of the relatively comfortable prisons of Istanbul.

As I said, I liked the film, as a movie, but, I would still criticise the film makers by being tools for such propoganda makers.  Oliver Stone himself came to Turkey recently and apologised for his mistake.  So, apart from this huge shame on the filmmakers' side, there is one scene, which is probably the closest to the most reality. That was the scene, where Hayes was going thru the security of the airport, and the acting of the policemen was just great.  Apart from these, if you keep this reality in mind while watching, the rest is a very nice film on screen, not a close reality of what you would see in Istanbul.

"This star-making vehicle for Brad Davis, he of the more-carnal-than James Dean school, has elements of real tension and hopeless Turkish jail atmosphere.

There are flaws, however, including a script that isn't entirely faithful to Hayes' story and a no-doubt-studio-inspired ""no, I cant kiss a dude, even in prison"" moment that Mr. Hayes (to say nothing of Mr. Davis) never quite experienced in real-life.

And the booby-thru-glass-partition scene is just plain silly. (Did this happen?!?)

Also, the film gets a little draggy with its one-atrocity-after-another approach to telling its tale... not always to the greatest effect.

Still a decent movie.",3.0
"The DVD was in excellent shape. I have no problem with Amazon's role in sending me the DVD of Roxanne.  I had thought to use the DVD with my JH class after having watched the French version of Cyrano.  Unfortunately the humor and message in Roxanne is much more adult oriented with a lot of adult sexual innuendo.  I was unable to use the film with my students other than to show them the scene where the fireman, Steve Martin, meets up with the two coke heads and takes them on in martial arts.  There is a great parody of the sword fighting scene in the theater between Cyrano and Valvert.",3.0
"I just got done watching this movie. Well, on the one hand, I have to admit that it was very well done. The acting was believable and convincing, the settings LOOKED like Turkey (I know, I've been there) and the soundtrack was pretty good.

But on the other hand, it bothered me that this movie's trying to make me feel sympathy for someone who did a crime. In my opinion, he broke the law, therefore he got what he deserved. SOL pal!

It also appeared to me that this movie is trying to show ""US=good"" and ""Turkey=bad"". How irresponsible can people get? If you've paid any attention to current events, guess what? Turkey is now showing a movie called ""Valley of the Wolves"", in which Americans are demonized in the Iraq war. Supposedly it's a big hit over there in Turkey. Hmmm, I wonder why.

I vacationed in Turkey in 2005, and personally, I had a GREAT time. Turks are indeed hospitable (thanks for all the ""tourist tea""!). Not surprisingly, I did not see ONE American tour group. I was with a German one. Even the Japanese vacation in Turkey! But apparently not too many Americans. Hmmm, again, I wonder why.

A bit of advice if you're planning on going overseas and want to avoid that one-in-a-million chance of getting into the sort of prison this movie depicts:

1) TRY to learn the language

2) Blend in (don't wear your ""Proud to be American"" shirt over there

3) Respect/follow their customs

4) Don't do anything stupid (like smuggle Hashish).

If you want to watch a movie about a terrible prison with a lot more merit to it (and also based on a true story, to boot), then I HIGHLY recommend ""Papillon"" and also the book by the same title by Henri Charriere.",3.0

"I feel the movie does some good.  It doesn't deny that the main charector was wrong for what he did.  Remember, back in 1970, there was a more cavilier attitude towards drugs and he was dealing with the original 4 year prison sentence appropriately.  But being beaten, tortured and imprisoned in a foriegn country, with limited contact with family and freinds is going to be traumatic for anyone, and the movie dispays that well.

With that said, however, I think the movie deviates WAY too much from the book.  The escape first-handedly described in the book is much more fascinating and would have been better to see than the movies deviation.  The ommision of some the amnesties to prisoners makes the movie fall short as well.

The movie gets the basic point of the book across, but the impact could have been stronger if it just followed the story as laid out by the first hand recollection of it.",3.0
"Brad Davis in his best, and most famous, role as Billy Hayes...a young American trapped in the Turkish prison system.  His beautiful, sensitive performance in an arguably (un)sympathetic role and Guber's understated direction combine to make this standard prison-break drama an above average and suspenseful two hours.

Interesting to see again in the context of 21st Century political climate/correctness, global relations and drug culture.  Too bad the 20th Anniversary DVD edition didn't rise to the occasion and include at least a scholarly or insightful commentary track...but they played it safe and played it cheap by slapping together this ""special edition"" which offers NOTHING special other than the fine performances and compelling story of the original film.  Oh, yeah...and the disk had some glitches, too.

"This is a watchable and disturbing film, but it raises my hackles a bit. Leaving aside the whole ""Is the film racist?"" discussion that taking up so much space I think what bothers me about it is the way Billy Hayes is portrayed as some sort of tragic hero, a misguided youth victimized by a brutal system. For God's sake, he was a drug smuggler! I think the script should have played up on that angle a bit more and we would have had a much more thoughtprovoking film. On the plus side, though, there are some very good performances and the soundtrack is worth hearing.",3.0

I figured I would buy the deluxe instead of just the normal DVD but I must say there is honestly no difference what so ever and I would suggest just buying the normal DVD instead of the deluxe.

"Resident Evil makes its way onto the big screen after all the times of having games on since the PlayStation since 1996.  While the movie you'd think it would go about following the first movie, but instead it's more of a prequel to the first game.  One of the things that I like about the movie, is that with the camera angles they make the movie feel like if it was a game but in a live action kind of way.  Although the story itself, does go about trying to give the fans, something new to look forward to and not a movie where everyone is going to know what's going to happen next.  Milla Jovovich, plays as `Alice' who from the start of the movie doesn't know who she is or what she did, though her memory starts coming in towards the end of the movie thus proving to be a nice story to the Resident Evil.  By the end of the movie, there'll be a bit of a twist although at the same time you'll recognize that something big is going to be set up for the next movie.  Some of the features that they have in this DVD are nice to see how the transition from game to movie was done.  Overall I give this 3.5 stars out of 5.",3.0
"The movie was fairly accurate.  The penalties for drug smuggling are severe and were realistically represented in this film.

However, I do have to object to the portrayal of abuses and tortures occuring in Turkish prisons.  This film seemed to paint the Turks as sadistic and vicious in the running of their correctional facilities.  In isolated cases, this may occur but in much lesser degrees than this movie displays.

I know this firsthand because I did a five year stint in Turkish prison.  Admittedly, I am a little more backboned than the average American tourist who finds himself getting pinched while trafficing Hashish out of Turkey but I could easily have done the entire 5 years standing on my head.

I certainly don't want to be a Turkish inmate again but if circumstances held it in the cards that I was required to serve another 5 year stint, I wouldn't even flinch but suck it up like a man.

I'm not saying it's Disney world over there, kids.  IT'S NOT!  Don't follow my mistakes.  But movies like this severely exaggerate the life inside a Turkish prison.

Turkish prison guards look at American drug smugglers much the same way as American prison guards look at ""celebrity gangsters"" here in the States.  For an American drug smuggler, Turkish prison life would more accurately be portrayed by the scenes in Goodfellas rather than by the scenes in Midnight Express.  In my case, since I am not Italian, rather than making pasta and garlic tomato sauce, they overlooked my contraband of pork chops and mashed potatos.",3.0

-Turkey only prodominantly moslim and domacratic country in the world
-Turkey recently abolished deth penalty (which is still in use in some states in usa) and had some good improvments in civil and minority rights.

"I think some of the people here are forgetting that this is just a movie! A movie ""BASED ON A TRUE STORY"". That does not mean that this is exactly what happened to Billy Hayes or that this is exactly how the prisons are in Turkey. This is Oliver Stone's writing at it's best. I loved this movie.
Brad Davis is phenomenal as Billy Hayes and it's a shame that he couldn't get his own real life together and become the star he should have become. Brad reminded me a lot of James Dean in this film. His acting, his looks, even the way he spoke. It was quite eerie actually. Brad deserved much better than one memorable film and a death, so cruel.
This is supposed to be a 20th Anniversary Edition dvd, which would suggest commentaries, deleted scenes and a host of other extras, but there is none of this. ...It's a real drag that this film doesn't get the proper dvd treatment it deserves. The featurette is nothing more than a VERY SHORT documentary on the life of the real Billy Hayes that was made in the late 70's. If you're looking for new information, you've come to the wrong place. The only thing that's great about this dvd is the transfer. It looks great for the most part, crisp and clean with very few artifacts and very little edge enhancement, though some of the scenes were very dark, which is probably the way they were originally shot. I'm not sure if it's just my dvd or if everyone else's dvd has a problem, but when Billy is meeting his Turkish lawyer for the first time and they are shaking hands they're is a slight ""roll"" in the dvd. Kind of like if you were watching this movie in the theater and the projector got hung up for a frame or two. It's not that bad but I thought I would mention it.
This is a great film and I highly recommend it to anyone who has never seen it. This movie holds up very well for being over 20 years old and it's still relevant today. I just wish it would have gotten much better treatment in this 20th Anniversary Edition. *sigh*",3.0
"This is the kind of shlock SF/action thing that, regardless of reviews or how bad the ads look, I nearly always have a gut desire to see - and which all too often disappoints.  Having gone into this one 8 years after its release, having studiously avoided it and its sequels and knowing almost nothing about the plot or the game it was based on, I have to say that I was somewhat pleasantly surprised, at least at first.  No, it's not a great film or even a particularly good one, but in the hands of a director who is even remotely competent or interesting, this could have been a solid entry into the action/horror/sc-fi arena.

Unfortunately, the director we have here is Paul W.S. Anderson, who has managed not only to have a fairly productive and lucrative career but also to marry the fabulous Milla Jovovich, his leading lady in this film and the sequels.  The only other PWSA film I've seen is ALIEN VS PREDATOR, and this is certainly a notch above that film, but it still shows plenty of examples of poor editing and narrative construction, dull and ugly action scenes - excepting a couple where Milla gets to kick butt on her own - and fairly obvious and trite horror movie clichs in abundance.

What's good about the film is mostly Milla, who I wouldn't say gives a terrific performance exactly, but who does exude a presence, show some nice physical grace and power, and communicate reasonably well the character of a woman just starting to come out of memory loss - and to realize just how much the mega-corporation that she and nearly everybody else works for has betrayed them all.  She is Alice, apparently a former security professional for the Umbrella Corporation, and she has seemingly lost her memory as a result of some kind of nerve gas.  She awakens in a fancy mansion that turns out to be a secret portal to the underground Hive, a supercomputer that runs nearby Raccoon City and is a breeding ground for all kinds of unorthodox experiments.  Alice has to accompany - and eventually lead - a team of commandos into the Hive to see what's gone wrong with it, and along the way they encounter those most boring (to me) of currently popular horror icons, zombies.  Somehow an anti-aging virus developed in the Hive has this unpleasant zombifying side-effect, and the Hive has killed off all of the scientiests within.  Except, of course, that you can't really kill a zombie.

Like I said, there are some good action scenes with Milla, and there's also a nice sense of claustrophobia at times - it seems like the Hive might go on forever - but on the whole this wasn't any better than ""OK"" for me, and it sure wasn't helped by the dreadful bang-your-head-against-the-wall music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson.  I guess it's what the kids like.  But to be fair, this probably does feel a lot like the videogame - lots of action and blood, paper-thin story and virtually zero in the way of characterizations.  Well, being a hardcore fantasy and SF viewer, I've certainly seen plenty of worse stuff.",3.0

"I watched the film on Tv 5 years ago and it was such an incredible night! After watching the film, as a Turk, I was there facing one of the most notorious films and i was just smiling, because it was just a film and nothing else. It is true..Turkey is not that democratic a country and we stil have problems. It is not easy to progress. There are lots of obstacles to get over. But it is also true that films just deviate from the truth..so the film is just an adaptation of the truth. And at that time, it was Oliver Stone's and Alan Parker's adaptation and comment. I don't think they have never cared about Turkey and its democracy. I don't even think they know where Turkey is. That's why it is very understandable. I don't really see the point what's so wonderful about the film. Prisons are bad places and nobody can claim the reverse. Turkish prisons are bad places just like american, greek, armenian, russian prisons. You turn the tv on and watch israelis kill palestinians, watch the cops beat black men in South africa, watch the racist people in america. It is not fiction. It is real. So if anyone claims this film represents the truth, I recommend them watch tv and see the real Midnight express. Better than Alan Parker's adaptation!",3.0
"I've seen ""Midnight Express"" several times since it opened its first theatrical run.  When I saw it in the theater I was so caught up in the story that I didn't pay too much attention to its bargain-basement racism.  Today, it's so heavy handed and obvious I'm amazed I could have missed it.
This story of a young American caught smuggling Hashish out of Istanbul goes out of its way to depict Turkey as a brutal, corrupt country, full of ""furriners.""  Oliver Stone's script is embarrassing in places, particularly when Billy Hayes gives his big speech in court, calling Turkey ""a nation of pigs.""  Talk about begging the question!  I would be surprised if anyone of Turkish descent were not deeply offended by this.
As long as you don't take it too seriously, Midnight Express can be an enjoyable non-think action movie.  John Hurt and Randy Quaid contribute superb performances, and Paul Smith does a convincing job of portraying the sadistic prison warden.  (It's a safe bet that no actual Turks were used in the making of this film, which was shot in Malta.)  Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack has dated badly, but is still catchy.
The DVD features an anamorphic transfer (enhanced for 16x9 TVs)with an excellent picture.  The soundtrack, unfortunately, is Dolby 2.0 and does not seem to have been remastered; much of the music sounds tinny and thin.",3.0
"On a cinematic level, Midnight Express is an extremely powerful movie.  It has a terrific, moving soundtrack.  The acting is terrific.  The late Brad Davis, who played the lead in this film, threw away what could have been a  fantastic acting career because of his own drug use.  (The actor was pretty  much blackballed after he gained a reputation for showing up to Hollywood  parties and  film shootings stoned.  He eventually died of AIDS.)  Some of  the speeches in the film are extremely powerful.  However, the main  character is simply put, a drug smuggler who got caught.  The movie does an  excellent job of making him extremely sympathetic.  If you purchase the  newest edition, there's a brief documentary on the real life Billy Hayes.  I find his general lack of remorse most interesting.  Additionally, the  movie takes some liberties with the facts.  From what I understand, the  first half of the film is fairly accurate.  He did caught smuggling drugs  out of turkey.  He was sent to prison.  He did get his feet beaten with a  club, and was hit in the groin with the club.  (He was not raped, as many  reviewers have indicated.)  When he had less than two months left on his  sentence, he was sentenced to more time.  However, it wasn't another 30  years, like the movie indicates.  Between time off for good behavior, a  partial amnesty to all prisoners, and time served from his first sentence,  Billy Hayes had roughly 3 years left when he escaped.  The extreme  brutality in the last third of the film is simply the product of Oliver  Stone's imagination.  In fact, Billy Hayes has said that he'd like to make  another movie to properly reflect what really happened.  (Personally, I  think he's just trying to profit more from his crime.) Many reviewers have  complained about the brutal way the prisons are portrayed.  This movie is  certainly exaggerated.  However, prisons are brutal places.  Additionally,  the Turks do beat prisoners on the feet.  As another reviewer commented,  it's worse than the U.S., but not as bad as other countries.  I'd like to  refer you to a previous customer review in which the reviewer hypothesizes  what would have had happened if he hadn't been caught.",3.0

"Moderately paced jazz is the music of love for the romantic comedy Roxanne, based loosely on the famous Edmond Rostand play Cyrano de Bergerac. The story itself is a timeless tale of love hindered by a colossally appalling facial feature, but screenwriter Steve Martin shakes things up a bit with generous amounts of whimsical comedy. At times it's too much, going almost as over-the-top as his Pink Panther films, themselves merely a vehicle for a one-laugh Frenchman impression. In Roxanne, he seems to channel the overacting of Jim Carrey, taking the already unbelievably Pinnochio-faced lead character in a direction of total poppycock. Unfortunately most of the humor falls flat.

Charles D. Bales (Steve Martin) is a fire chief in the small town of Nelson and a hopeless romantic, poetic and kind, but plagued by an inescapably large nose. When he meets Roxanne Kowalski (Daryl Hannah), a stunningly beautiful astronomer (or so the other actors must pretend), he immediately falls in love. She's everything he could want in a woman, but she sees him only as a friend, instead infatuated with the muscular new fireman Chris McConnell (Rick Rossovich) who recently joined Charlie's team.

Although he too wishes to see more of Roxanne, Chris lacks confidence with women, and is reduced to a clumsy mess in their presence. Given the opportunity to convey his true feelings for Roxanne, Charlie agrees to write a letter to her for Chris. When his lyrical wordsmanship instantaneously seduces Roxanne, Charlie finds himself continuing to woo her for the benefit of his competition. But how can she love him for who he is when he has such a hideously humongous nose?

Where Cyrano fought with a sword, Charlie fights with a tennis racket against golf clubs. Although he commands an incredibly inept anti-Backdraft fire department, he excels at physical and verbal jousting, the former contributing to much of the cheesiness of the plot, while the latter accounts for the few genuine laughs. Oddly enough, the explanation for why Charlie won't simply get a nose job is more believable than his noble intentions for continuing to sweep his dream girl off her feet and into the arms of a scatterbrained hunk. Roxanne tragically and carelessly teeters on the border of harmless romantic comedy and eye-gouging filmic nonsense, making it less than appealing for viewers not infatuated with Martin's brand of comedy. Longtime fans, however, may see this film as a highlight.

I enjoyed the series of Resident Evil. I bought the DVD before and decided to buy the Blu ray to see the difference. A 61 inches DLP did tell the difference between the picture quality of DVD and Blu Ray. It is fun to watch and the special effect still look good.,3.0
"The virus that turned the inhabitants of the Hive into flesh eating zombies has now made it's way through Raccoon City turning the cities inhabitants into...well, flesh eating zombies. The city has been quarantined. No one is able to leave or enter. However, the few that have yet been affected by the virus are not without hope as long as they have Alice.

Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice, the zombie butt kicking heroine from the 2002 hit, Resident Evil. She has become stronger and more aware of her abilities. Unfortunately, so has her enemies. Umbrella has released their newest weapon into the city - Nemesis. Nemesis is a hulking abomination that has his eyes set on the S.T.A.R.S team and on Alice.

This movie leaves the confines of the Hive, and takes to the streets of Raccoon City. While the areas are dark and definitely spooky, the suspense is killed by how open they are. One of the biggest draws of Resident Evil was the claustrophobia inducing corridors. The characters never knew what was around the corner, and they had little time to react or maneuver when they found out. You simply never get this feeling with Apocalypse. Suspense has been replaced with action. What you are  left with is a decent action zombie movie with little resembling the Resident Evil tone and mood.

With action playing a greater role, the pacing has quickened quite a bit with frequent explosions, shootouts, and hand to hand combat. I believe more with this movie than any other, Milla secured her title of the ""Female Arnold Schwarzenegger"". She really gives the big guy from Austria a run for his money when it comes to being a kick butt action star.

This is nothing really groundbreaking with the special features - commentaries, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, etc. As usual, the better commentary track comes from the filmmakers rather than the cast.

Picture quality is not bad, but it's not a real looker either. My biggest complaint is with the skewed black levels. It looks a bit bright which hurts the contrast in darker scenes of which 98% of the movie is composed of. Colors are generally good, but nothing really pops. It is disappointing, but not necessarily a deal breaker. Sound quality is excellent. With a good surround sound setup, the groans of the undead will put the hair on the back of your neck at attention.

Overall, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not Resident Evil. The suspenseful mystique of the 2002 film has been lost, and replaced with something that more resembles a summer blockbuster. Fans of the Resident Evil universe will still find enough to keep them entertained, but this movie definitely won't change the minds of those on the fence.

As I kept watching I couldn't keep thinking of all  the rascism directed towards Turkish people. There's not even one nice  Turkish person in the film.

"If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.

This obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.

These first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descent into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of ""White Rabbit"" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.

In short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.

This second film is, in my opinion, marginally better than the first film.  It feels less tied to the strict gameplay narrative that hobbled the first film.  On the other hand, I really didn't like the feel of Raccoon City in it.  It never really came to feel like a real place.  It just felt like a succession of sets, whether indoor or outdoor.  Contrast this with THE MATRIX, where the city of the construct felt much more alive and actual.

I will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.  That would be a more impression achievement if there had been some really good movies based on that source, but it is unlikely for some time that another game will produce such a film franchise.",3.0
"In the never-ending effort to find new material for movies, the industry has gone to a whole host of new media over the past 2 or 3 decades to include graphic novels, video and computer games, and even theme park rides.  Perhaps not surprisingly game adaptations have been perhaps the least success of all the films based on new sources.  Almost without exception movies based on console or computer games have been unspeakably awful.  RESIDENT EVIL, while not a great movie, nonetheless manages to be perhaps the best that the genre has produced.  It has, moreover, provoked two sequels that are both arguably better than the film that started it off.

I have not played RESIDENT EVIL (apart from RPGs like Dungeon Siege and Elderscrolls and especially MMORPGs like Asheron's Call and World of Warcraft I generally avoid games), so I don't know how closely this film adheres to its storyline, but you constantly feel the restrictions of a highly predetermined story line.  The entire film -- unlike the sequel -- feels as if it is progressing via a formula.

Milla Jovovich has managed to build a career playing strong, heroic women.  The first film most people know her from is THE FIFTH ELEMENT, but she later went on to make THE MESSENGER (about Joan of Arc), also with Luc Besson at the helm (over the course of his career he has constantly made films featuring female action heroes).  She does a creditable job in all three as someone who manages to be heroic despite attempts at the Umbrella Corporation to manipulate her for their own purposes.

This can be a fun movie if gone into with rather low expectations.  There is a low of gore, some pretty tense moments, but not a lot of plot.  As usual in these movies, greedy corporations are ultimately the enemy (something even truer in real life, yet why don't we remember that in real life?).  If taken for what it is -- slick fluff -- it can be enjoyable.  But if you start interrogating the plot and trying to make sense of it, you'll get frustrated quick.

I first saw this several years ago.  At that time the only cast members I knew were Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez.  On this rescreening I was pleasantly surprised to see Eric Mabius in one of the main roles.  He is best known today as Daniel Meade on UGLY BETTY.  And while he doesn't quite make it into the sequel, his character sorta, kinda does.",3.0
I'm a die hard RE fan.  So I'm use to the games more.  This movie was good.  Lots of action which is nice.  But it wasn't all that scary like the first one.  Playing RE: 3 last espace is so scary and I felt the film was lacking that. Plus they hardly showed Nemesis.,3.0
"I think few people who, like me, had read the book by Pat Conroy would be satisfied with the movie version.  On the positive side, it was well acted, well cast and the script did not stray too far from the novel.  However, so  much was left out that the power and drama of the novel were lost.  Particularly disappointing was the fact that Luke and Savannah, two of the  main characters in the book, barely featured in the movie.  Focussing so  much on the romance between Tom and Lowenstein, only a secondary storyline  in the novel, may have made the story more straightforward but also more  ordinary.  Nick Nolte was great as Tom and I did enjoy the movie, but after  reading the book and knowing what the film could have been I feel a bit  disappointed.  Probably this book would be better adapted for a  mini-series, where more time could be allowed to develop all aspects of the  story.",3.0

"When I first rented the original ""Resident Evil"" I was completely shocked at how much I liked it.  I had zero expectations for it, yet was sucked in by it's story, characters and visualisation.  So I ran out and purchased it (as soon as it was on sale).  Since then I've watched it about 10 times, which is pretty remarkable considering I have roughly 350 DVDs to choose from.  Given this, as a non-gamer, I was surprised to find that gamers were generally disappointed in this movie (not all of them, but most negative reviews were from gamers).

Now we have ""Resident Evil- Apocalypse"".  Don't get to see ""grown-up"" movies at the theater, so I had to wait until the DVD release.  I liked the first so much, I did not even think of renting this.  I quickly bought the DVD (when it went on sale, never buy at full price)with much anticipation.  Roughly 3 years later I have viewed it approximately (well, ACTUALLY)1 time.  That's right, no type-o.  JUST ONCE.  It was not nearly as compelling as the first film (to me).  Gone was the gripping story, the great camera work, the excellent character development.  In the stead of this great stuff was some sort of ""made-for-cable"" goofy monster movie.  Now, I did not hate it, (I actually like goofy monster movies) but it is not begging me to watch it again.  It's so in-your-face that after one viewing, there was nothing left to see.  No mystery.  No subtlety.  No sense of future dread. It was done.

But wow!  Gamers really like it!!  Now it all makes sense.  Since I find shooter games extremely redundant and difficult to play more than once, I found this movie to be the same.  A one timer (OK maybe 2). Kind of like sixth sense.  Once you get to the end, well..  ...it's over.

Cinematically, comparing this to the first film is like comparing the first ""Star Wars"" to the last (I'm talking release dates, not ""Lucas-Time"").  It's comparing something that is a carfully thought out and woven tale, to something that is simply a series of events strung together to make a story.  Kind of like Shooter video games.  You travel down a linear path and take on what's in front of you.  Unfortunatly this is a film!

I can't say don't buy this if you liked the first.  It's nice to have a continuation of the first.  Just don't go in with the same expectations.",3.0
"Milla Jovavich is back as @$$kicking Alice in the sequel to 2002's `Resident Evil'.  In `Apocalypse' we are given more of the same but it doesn't seem to really perform as well as the first film.  The sets aren't as exciting or as memorable, and the inclusion of Nemeses may excite some it left me a bit stale.  Milla is still as great and as fun as ever, and new to the game stars like Sienna Guillory (who plays video game favorite Jill Valentine) and Oded Fehr do a fine job of supporting her but the real stars are the CGI effects which work well for the most part.  Expect lots of action and lots of blood but with Michelle Rodriguez's snappy Rain missing and the lack of originality found in the first `Resident Evil' film `Apocalypse' just isn't strong enough to warrant it's own following.  Maybe three's a charm.",3.0

"One of the best parts about this movie is the clear indication that Milla Jovovich is on her way to being one of the first major female action-movie stars.  She comes across as tough and kick-*ss as she should be as Alice, an enhanced fighting machine who can help residents of Raccoon City who have been locked in by the Umbrealla Corporation to contain an outbreak of T-Virus, which is turning everyone around them into zombies.  There are some good action sequences (I have a soft spot for seeing zombies getting kung-fu'ed out of their socks, okay?) and some over the top mid-air explosions and such which bring down the interest some, but of course the big element played in this sequel, much like the original, is the intrigue of the plans of Umbrella.  It's enough to keep watching to make this an above-average action-zombie-bad-coproration flick, though still in the end a genre piece that does not challenge the genre much.",3.0

"I dunno quite how you should rate this movie.  Certainly, it is bad, but it is also amusing.  3 stars and a C seems fair, I suppose.  Anyway, It's really quite a sight. You don't often see movies in this day and age with this kinda of budget that is as flatly goofy as 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'.  The original RE film was stupid, yes, but it really wasn't in the same league as this one in terms of sheer wackiness. (To the best of my recollection, anyway. It's been quite a while...)  Still, you've gotta give RE: Apocalypse this: It's gotta whole helluva lotta action.  It's quite nonstop the first like 2/3 of the movie, though it actually slows down some towards the end. It actually gets a little dull for a while, but the final fights, particularly the outrageous kung-fu battle between Alice and Nemesis are sufficiently hilarious as to get the movie back on track, or at least as on track as it ever was.

Anyway, this one takes place directly after the original, with the zombies and various other monster having escaped the Hive and laying waste to Raccoon City (It's adorable that they kept that name, by the way.)  It is shortly sealed off by the Evil B*stards in charge of Umbrella.  Also, there's a scientist dude who invented the T-Virus and isn't quite as evil and he wants to get his daughter out out, and there's Nemesis whose been let loose in the city and he's a jerk, and Alice is there too and a bunch of STARS people and a reporter and also this jive-talking black dude who is quite likely to offend those who are won't to be offended by things and blah blah blah.  Anyway, they've got to run around and yell and shoot a lot of zombies and lickers and some zombie dogs whatnot.  And so they do.

To give credit where credit is due, the set design and art direction in this film are generally quite excellent.  I particularly like the large church/cathedral they take refuge in.  However, the cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired. It's trying to be hypermodern and flashy but it's mostly just chintzy.  I'm not really opposed to this kinda thing in and of itself, but it's easy to screw it up, and that's what they've done here.  The action scenes aren't exciting, but they do have a sorta goofy energy to them that makes them fun.  Also, the film is never in the least bit scary, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for zombies.  These ain't the greatest zombies ever, but they work.  However, the film is utterly devoid of gore, which is quite aggravating and unforgivable.  We don't even get any notable close-ups of zombies getting their brains blasted out, and you need like a bare minimum of 15 of those in your zombie movie. (You could perhaps go a bit lower here, as shooting them in the head isn't necessary, but there need to be a lot more than none of them, anyway.)

Performances are generally either comical or flat.  Milla Jovovich is quite dull and really not all that attractive as our crazy semi-mutant hero Alice.  Sienna Guillory is our second major protagonist, Jill Valentine, and is better than Milla, or better looking anyway, which is what mostly counts in this kinda movie.  As you probably already know, they dress her as Jill was dressed in RE3,(i.e. tube top and mini skirt) which amuses me to no end.  This does not strike as the most practical battle outfit, but she didn't really have time to prepare, I guess, and she does look pretty damn hot, so I'm not complaining.  Also in attendance is some dude playing Carlos.  I do not remember a single thing about him, apart from one utterly hilarious line of dialogue.  There's also this Nickolai dude.  He's pretty cool. He's my favorite character, in fact, but he hasn't got that much screen time, sadly.

As if I haven't made this clear yet, this is definitely a good-bad movie.  I wasn't quite laughing at it, but I was smirking, continually, which is about the same thing.  I had a good time watching it, what can I say. Wouldn't mind watching it again some day.  It gives me hope for future video game movies, that they can still be stupidly amusing.  They've headed in a bad direction as of late, with 'Silent Hill' and 'Doom' being stupidly boring rather than stupidly watchable.  RE:Apocalypse gives us the real goods, at least as far as this kinda movie goes.

Also, it does have perhaps the greatest line in all of film.  Some STARS dudes are discussing how, after they've been left in Raccoon City, they don't matter to the corporation and they're expendable and then Carlos (I believe) says: 'We've just been expended.'  HA!!!!!!!!!  That is frickin' hilarious.  I believe the proper term would be spent.  Anyway, an entertaining movie.

"After getting dogged by many Resident Evil fans about the 1st film not being truly true to the game, Anderson decides to make the sequel more closer to the game's sequels. Didn't do a very good job of doing that.

The fools from Umbrella Corp. unleash the dead in the hive, and now the T-Virus is spreading through out Raccoon City. Citizens cannot leave the city, and now are trapped with the walking dead.

Jovovich returns as the dull and boring Alice, who now has super powers like a fake ass Albert Wesker wannabee from Code Veronica X. Along trapped in Raccoon City is Jill Valentine (Guillory), a reporter (Holt), 2 Umbrella soldiers (Fehr, Ward), a citizen (Epps) and a few others I don't care mentioning.

On their tales is a killing maching called Nemesis (Taylor). Once again, no gore, dull characters, and boring Alice taking away the spoylight from real characters from the game. Nemesis is a weak sissy in this film, and he looks cheesey. Nicholai in the game is a old and evil man. In this movie, Nicholai is a young man on the good guys' side.

The slow-motion scenes of the zombies' walking looks stupid, and once again, these zombies are pitiful. This film does have a few good scenes, good fight scenes, and the ending isn't bad. However, it's just like the first film...disappointing.

Resident Evil really needs to be redone soon. And when I mean redone, I mean no Anderson, no Screen Gems, and no Alice. At least these Resident Evil films are good for one thing...they entertain.",3.0
"Since I am a fan of the game, I see all the many flaws in this fake version of a film pretending to be Resident Evil. When I heard that Anderson was writing and directing this film, I thought it could be close to the game since he did a good job directing Mortal Kombat, and did a good job writing Shopping. But when I heard that none of the charcters or much of the game's elements are not in this film, I knew trouble was ahead.

Milla Jovovich playes Alice, an employee of Umbrella Corp. who doesn't remember anything after being exposed to knockout gas. She goes with soldiers to the hive that's under the mansion. When they get there, all the workers in the hive are dead. While trying to turn off the Red Queen, the dead workers become undead because of the T-Virus that gets loose in the hive.

The characters in this film are dull and boring. Rain (Rodriquez) and J.D. (Aleardi) are nothing more than a Vasquez and Drake ripoff from Aliens. The gore is so PG-13,this film is onlt ""R"" for language and the little nudity.

This film was the beginning of Anderson being a liar. He lied about a much gorier version coming on DVD. No version of that came out. However, he did told the truth in Fangoria issue #211 about the script of this film is just a homage to the game he wrote before he got the job. That would explain why it's really nothing like the game.

Another lie from him is that he says it's based before the mansion situation in the original game. Well, if that's true, where's Rebecca, Forest, Kenneth and a few other that were in that mansion before S.T.A.R.S. arrived?

Resident Evil does have good visuals, some good scenes, and a very cool score by Marilyn Manson. This film doesn't bore, doesn't make you go to sleep, doesn't make you look at your watch, but it's not a Resident Evil film. All we're watching is the script Anderson wrote that was turned into Resident Evil. He should've just released the film like that.",3.0

"Being a Resident Evil fan since the 2nd game came out for PlayStation. I noticed the simularities that they tried to do in the game and movie. The Dislikes which made me give it a 3/5 is becuase of the music and action scenes. The action scenes seemed terrible, the combat moves to be exact. if they tried harder on the combat moves it would have made it seem more interesting. The music! They could have done better! It was the worst ever, they played music at the wrong times, music that didn't even belong with the scenes! Also what dissapointed me was that one character, that ""funny"" one, they should have left him out, i never found any lines of his funny and its suppose to be a thriller/ Sci Fi film, not a comedy film. But unfortionetly hes going to be in the 3rd movie also, i forgot what it was called. THe nemisis should have been kept till the 3rd movie, but remember readers! Always in the 3rd films, they go back to the 1st movie and talk about stuff we didn't know! The first one was the best! THE HIVE!",3.0
"Not as good as I hoped or wanted. The movie is extremely well done. Well acted and directed and Conroy also wrote the screen play. I guess my objection is with Conroy both with this film, this book and some of his others, like the Great Santini. While he does a great job of honestly describing his horrific childhood experiences, I don't care for his Pollyanna, whitewash type endings. It is essential that we come to terms with our issues but that doesn't necessarily mean giving a mea culpa to those responsible all the time, especially if they are not repentant or own their crimes. The ending line that ""In families, there is no crime that can't be forgiven"" is particularly disturbing. I don't think that's true at all. And I think Conroy's tendency to always wrap things with a Rodney King-like bow, doesn't work very well and ruins the impact of his truly courageous work. But looking at Streisand is always pleasant.",3.0

"My biggest annoyance with this movie is the fact that it has almost nothing to do with the original video game.  The other thing that annoys me is the fact that 2/3 of the characters are killed in about 5 minutes and we don't even get to really know half of them.  Other than that the visual style, special effects, and story of the movie all add together to produce an entertaining sci-fi horror movie that will hopefully not cause an outrage amongst die hard fans of the video games.  This isn't meant to be a re-make of the first game, but it does use some similar elements and some completely knew ones.  If you enjoy Paul Anderson's other works such as Soldier, Event Horizon, and/or AvP, you'll probably like this.  If you only go for Spielberg type movies than stay away from this at all costs.",3.0

"The book The Prince of Tides is my all time favorite and  has been since the first time I read it 15 years ago. I finally broke down and watched the movie,  I did enjoy the movie, it was actually better than I thought it would be, Nick Nolte did an excellent job playing Tom Wingo and even Barbra Streisand was a good fit for the character of Lowenstein. However, as I expected this book did not even compare to the movie. I feel like this movie was more about Tom's relationship with Lowenstein, where the novel  was more about the three siblings backstory and childhood. There is so much more to this story then what is portrayed in this film, I have lived in North and South Carolina in small coastal towns my whole life but would have loved for people who haven't had this pleasure to see more of the area in which these children grew up in, would have loved it to have showed more what it is like for kids to grow up on the coast. So many good characters were left out, Luke and Savannah who were big parts of the book we're hardly in the movie at all. I would have loved to see more of these characters in the movie as well as some of the other colorful characters Conroy created brought to life  like Grandpa Wingo and Taletha. I wish someone would remake this movie and add some of these characters and some of the exciting and hilarious scenes from the book, like them breaking into the aquarium and rescuing the porpose,some of grandpas stunts like water skiing and walking up and down the street carrying his cross, Taletha taking the kids coffin shopping would have made a hilarious scene for the movie, they siblings carrying the turtle into the Newberry House, they even took out the backstory of Callanwolde and the way that scene went down was was much more exciting than the book, I could go on and on naming scenes i would have liked to see added to this movie, too bad I'm not a big Hollywood screenwriter lol. The book is so wonderful, through the whole story it seems like you are either laughing or crying, I did not get the same emotions from watching this movie. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone, definitely worth watching but if you have read the novel be prepared for a little bit of disappointment. I'm only giving this movie 3 stars however it may have scored higher if I was not such a fan of the book. if anyone with the means and ability to do so happens to read this please please please do a remake of this movie based more on the book, they could do so much more than they did with the original version with all the advances we have had in film in technology since the first movie was made, I guarantee if someone went about transferring this story to film the right way it would be an absolute huge a hit!",3.0
"-- One more time.

It's pretty good of its kind. You know, the UnDead walk the earth (stumble, mostly), driven only by the urge to chomp on anyone not yet of their kind. Genus: scary monster movie, Species: undead zombie, Distinguishing features: Milla Jovovich.

'Resident Evil' does a pretty fair job. This time, the cause is is a virus cooked up in secret labs by The Evil Corporation, tapping into more modern kinds of fears and kinds of bad guys. (Give the movie a little time, and your idea of who's bad might change.) The action is strong, continuous, and well paced, with one more surprise in every scene, right up to the end. That ending, of course, sets up the inevitable sequel.

Since they followed the recipe for a good monster/action flick, not a lot could go wrong. Milla's babe appeal spiced up the mix in a few places, especially near the end, but could have been used more. The movie dishes out big servings of action, served with a side of gore. In the end, though, the result lacks flavor. I enjoyed watching it, but it never really rises above its genre.

"I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil games. In fact, I denied that any other games existed for a long time. After seeing and, consequently, being disappointed in the first Resident Evil, I debated about seeing ""Apocalypse"" up until today. Having finally watched it, I am now qualified to write a review.

Firstly, the lack of Claire and Leon is moderately distressing. I watched the entire first movie wondering if Milla Jovavich was supposed to be Claire or Jill. Seeing as her name is Alice, the mystery deepens.

The action was decent, though highly unrealistic when correlated with game play. I know, I know, I'm being a nerdy purist, but the fact is, Alice kicks much ass with her hands and legs....have you ever tried killing one of those damn zombies with your handy dandy Bowie knife when you blew all your magnum bullets on the dogs? I think the game ends right there. Too much kung foo, and out of focus too.

I understand a man's need to see girls in skimpy clothing and even blow some heads off and do a somersault over a motorcycle, but this is ridiculous. Jill's top would TOTALLY have buckled like a belt about 80 times during the film. She even had a bit more on in the game!!

But I digress. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, I'm just saying more people would find it more irritating if they had heard Milla Jovavich sing. Not quite the badass now, eh? I guess all we can do now is wait for Resident Evil 3....",3.0
"Beautiful visuals and an excellent Nick Nolte, just can't make up for the fact that the main character, Luke, who IS the prince of tides, has been pretty much eliminated from the film, to give the character of Lowenstein - a supporting one in the novel, a much bigger role. So the storytelling is confusing. You could easily come out of this film wondering who the prince of tides actually was. It's obvious that the novel has been carefully thought through and adapted, but it's also obvious that Streisand has re-configured the narrative to place herself front and centre. Nobody expected the entire book to be on the screen, but more of everyone else, and a bit less of Streisand, would have made this film much better, and silenced the most critical critics. Streisand is a truely great singer, and a talented director, but I think it could easily have been a better movie.",3.0
"This 2004 horror/action sequel from Sony is among the first titles to be ported to the PSP UMD video format.  Starring the lovely Milla Jovovich, RE:A is loosely based on the video game series from Capcom.

The Movie <spoiler alert!>

Let's just be honest here: when you're dealing with a movie based on a B-genre video game title you are asking for trouble.  The fact that said movie is a sequel further exacerbates the problem.  Now, the first RE movie was actually a  moderate success.  Beautiful Milla was a likeable heroine and the plot was servicable, if full of blatant rip-offs from a host of better sci-fi/horror flicks.  Still, the movie was well-paced, and had a killer opening sequence.  There was a fair balance of action, horror, and science fiction throughout.

RE:Apocolypse, by contrast, is a more straight forward action film that suffers as a result of it's own failed expectations.  The story basically centers around how the shadowy, uber-corporation, Umbrella, ends up pitting their two greatest genetic warriors, Alice and Nemesis (her now mutated beyond recognition old partner/lover), against each other.  The whole middle of the movie is simply filler to allow a couple of characters from the game series (Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera, played by Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr respectively) to make an appearance and provide a plot device to segue to a possible third sequel.

Granted you can't expect too much from a movie like this, but my biggest gripe by far is the very lame guy-in-a-rubber suit fight at the end.  Director Alexander Witt tries his best to hide this really really really bad attempt at a ""Big Boss Battle"" between Alice and Nemesis with very close-up, choppy camera work, and quick-cut edits, but it's pretty obvious that they needed a budget for digital effects that they did not end up getting.

Overall, this movie is at least half-way entertaining, especially if you're a fan of Milla as she is quite the ass-kicker.  Jovovich is quoted as being a fan of the game, and it's to her credit that she takes this role seriously enough to lend it some credibility despite the tacky premise and uninspired, contrived scripting.

The Video

Pretty close to what you would find on DVD.  There is some bleeding/saturation of dark scenes that you would expect from the LCD screen, but overall it's nothing that only a real videophile would get riled over.

The Sound

Dialog is soft, but the general sound field and effects are well done.  For example, helicopter rotors moving across the screen have the appropriate effect on the headphones.  Nice.

Special Features

There are none.

Summary

Despite it's many flaws, RE:A is really the kind of movie the PSP is going to be concentrating on for now: relatively short, action-oriented films with cheap thrills.  Taken for what it is, it is more of a ""guilty pleasure"" than anything else.

I can't really recommend it, but being a Milla softie I enjoyed it.",3.0
"With the success of the original movie, Resident Evil.  I find myself seeing the sequel to it, Resident Evil: Apolcalypse.  With low expectations I found that this movie was silly, filled with action, and didn't have much character development nor a very good atmosphere that usually makes up a great film.  With that said, the movie was still good enough to be enjoyed as an entertaining movie.  With another solid acting job as the hero, Milla has convinced me that she belongs as a bad-ass super-hero.",3.0
"I like Milla Jovovich as a superhero.  Her breakout role in ""The Fifth Element"" was all that was needed to sell me on her.  She was fine in the first ""Resident Evil"", which was better than perhaps it was given credit for.  But in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", Jovovich's Alice is given something of a makeover.  When we last saw Alice at the end of the first movie she had been captured by scientists from the evil Umbrella Corporation and was subject to some tests and experiments.  At the end of the movie we saw Alice walking alone on a street that was desolate and ruined, as if there were some sort of war or battle.  It is at this point that ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" begins.

Raccoon City is the victim of the T-Virus from the Umbrella Corporation.  This virus turns ordinary people into flesh eating zombies (is there another kind?), and like any good zombie virus, it is highly contagious.  Umbrella Corporation apparently has the power to lock down the city and prevent anyone from leaving, but there are still some citizens left alive, including ""disgraced"" police officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory).  Jill, and another officer attempt to hide before leaving the city and while being confronted by some nasty zombie creatures they meet Alice.  During that whole period where she was a captive and the victim of experiments, Alice has apparently picked up some sort of upgrade to her natural biology because she kicks serious butt here.  She fights like a super soldier or super hero, more like ""The Fifth Element's"" Leeloo than anyone else.

Besides the hordes of zombies, there is also a new super zombie looking creature called Nemesis which is stalking the city.  Exactly what Nemesis is and where it came from is a little bit of a mystery, though a little thinking about the clues given will solve the riddle fairly quickly.

This is a nothing special action/zombie movie.  Fans of the first ""Resident Evil"" may be disappointed.  I know that despite myself, I did enjoy the first movie.  There was more character interaction and character development, but this movie just had hordes of zombies and a bit too much action.  And while I like Jovivich as a superhero, this didn't seem to be a role that really needed to such an incredibly strong superhero.  I guess I didn't belive it.  The door was left open for a third movie, and perhaps there will be one, but until that point there is no real reason to watch ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"".  There are far better movies out there.

"First of all, I need to get my biases out of the way.  I have followed and played almost every Resident Evil game (both good and bad) from the very first one on the Playstation through the latest and by far the greatest on the Gamecube.  When I heard they were making a Resident Evil movie, I was uncertain of how I felt; were they going to remake a game into a movie or would they create a movie that fit into the Resident Evil mythos?  The first movie did the latter, introducing new characters while fitting pretty nicely into the mythology of the RE videogames.  It wasn't a great movie by far, but it was at least quasi-faithful to the series.

Now we have Resident Evil Apocalypse which falls into the former category as it takes familiar characters and incorporates basically parts of Resident Evil 2 and 3 into movie form.  Unfortunately, it falls flat for me.  On one hand, I was thrilled to finally see the Nemesis on the big screen.  Being the unstoppable killing machine that he is and spouting that famous gravelly line, ""STARS!"" I was immediately excited to see the movie but I was worried how they would incorporate Alice from the movie with Jill from the video game.

To be faithful to the video games, you can't.  It's that simple.  By having this movie, it's as if Resident Evil 3 never took place.  It takes the premise of the movie: people trapped in Raccoon City with zombies and the Nemesis, and completely changes the story.  Every time I started to get pulled into the movie, something would happen that would make me go, ""wait, that didn't happen in the game.""

That said, my friends who haven't played any of the Resident Evil games had a fun time.  I think those who haven't played the video game will have a better chance of enjoying it.  Although, video game aside, I think the action is pretty stale and there's not a build up of tension like in the first movie.  I enjoyed RE 1 much more than this sequel and so did my friends (both RE junkies and not).  However, this movie and this series is much much much better than the majority of video game adaptations.  With movies like House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, even this movie stands as a king above them which is kind of sad.

At any rate, not as good as the first, not very faithful to the video game series and not very thrilling.  But, it can be enjoyable for a rent or to see the Nemesis in a movie.  Hopefully the third movie RE Afterlife will take place before Resident Evil 4 (the game) and won't deal *directly* with any of the games.",3.0

"I did like RE:A, but I found it a disappointment because the movie makes it too clear that the main characters are going to survive.  It takes all the suspense out of the climactic fight scene when you already know Alice is going to make it!

The most egregious example of this is the first time Alice and Nemesis fight.  Alice escapes down a garbage chute and Nemesis launches a rocket after her.  It goes off three feet from her butt and her only cover is a wheeled gargage bin.  Alice not only survives, she's unharmed!

Another example:  The deus ex mechanica when they rescue Angela.  Jill's exploding-stove trick doesn't work, but Alice just HAPPENS to have a lit cigarette, she HAPPENS to understand what Jill's plan is, and she HAPPENS to be in just the right place to toss her cig exactly where needed.

I could go on, but I don't actually want to run the movie down.  RE:A is pretty good, but it could have been so much better.",3.0
"The kind is a zombie movie, with an extra monster thrown in for fun. That about sums it up.

Our Heroines are on the run from the evil flesh-eaters, going through ammunition at a good clip (pun intended). There is the standard cute little girl in need of saving - but this girl turns out to have an odd secret. There is the standard ineffectual babe, though with Jovovich and Guillory around, that's certainly not the only woman's role in this movie. There is the evil alliance of corporation and government in an evil plot and cover-up. You know, the usual.

This is just mindless entertainment - not that that's always a bad thing. It's a fair way to kill an evening, if you have one that needs killing.

"Hot on the heels of Dawn of the Dead remake and well past our memory retention for it's original, RE: Apocalypse picks up right about where the first one left off.  This time, it's an entire city that's being brought down by a virus invested population instead of a claustrophobic high tech lab.

A recap voice over given by Alice (in Wonderland?), played by Milla Jovovich gives the update we need even if we had released what little emotional attachment we had to the first one.  I give high kudos for the creators in making a movie that actually surpasses the first one in production value and action thrills.  The first was more of a suspense movie, which is fine because the suspense of what they discovered in the first one is gone.  We know what they are up against.

This one is actually more like the video game, an action shoot-em-up where the popular characters come together to fight the `Evil'.  I'm not familiar with the characters from the game but I was intrigued when I saw Jill Valentine smoke up the screen.  Nothing better then to put a hot female cop in a mini skirt, black go-go boots and corset with guns strapped to her hips.  Hello Nurse!

Anyway, the situation in the movie goes from bad to worse as the virus catches up with almost all the characters introduced.  Only a few remain at the end and the finale is actually pretty impressive with a shameless introduction for a third installment.  All in all, this is a good sequel and a great popcorn/action/horror flick with only passable dialogue but well done action sequences and thrills to spare.",3.0
"I have to confess that I don't play video games - eye-hand coordination and lightning reflexes weren't included in my genetic package, so this review is based on the movie - and nothing but the movie.

Other than Milla Jovovich, no cast member did any real acting.  Michelle Rodriguez had a fairly difficult role to play, but the snarling and eye rolling was just too much at times.  She was necessarily tough, but the dialogue also really let her down. The rest of the cast was on par for a B Grade horror movie, and only slightly more animated than the zombies.

This movie is what happens when you mix too many good things in a haphazard way. Imagine trying to write a coherent script when your ""must"" list includes zombies, were-dogs, sloppy genetic mutations with long tongues, a controlling computer system, an impregnable ""fortress"", a knockout babe with amnesia, a SWAT team, biological warfare, viruses, spies and saboteurs, a battle on a train, and guns - lots of guns.

The zombie scenes failed to impress, no gore to be seen anywhere - they just looked like a typical crowd of people in the mosh pit at a rock concert.  The mutating tissue-thing was straight out of a Dean Koontz book, and most of the suspense scenes weren't very suspenseful, because whatever you expected to happen - did.

On the cool side, you had the wicked lasers to do the slicing and dicing, Alice's (Milla) hot red zombie-kicking slit-way-up the side dress, and the fight scenes.  Many parts may seem familiar, mainly because you've seen scenes just like them in other popular action movies.

Next time let Alice do some Mortal Kombat with Lara Croft and you can call it a Final Fantasy.

"Resident Evil: Apocalypse (Alexander Witt, 2004)

Resident Evil: Apocalypse may be Alexander Witt's first directorial credit, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have more than enough experience under his belt to direct an action flick. His previous credits include work on such things-blow-up-nicely movies as Pirates of the Caribbean, XXX, Gladiator, and Lethal Weapon 3. So you can go into Apocalypse knowing you're going to get, at least, a solid action flick.

Then you take a look at the cast. Milla Jovovich returns, of course, but much of the rest of the cast are also known for solid action-film work; there's Oded Fehr (The Mummy), Jared Harris (b. Monkey), Sienna Guillory (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Razaaq Adoti (Black Hawk Down), and Zack Ward (Freddy vs. Jason), among others. Getting away from action films, Sandrine Holt (Black Robe) and Mike Epps (Strays) also jump out of the cast. So you know you have a well-acted solid action flick.

Unfortunately, that's all you get. It's really kind of depressing that one of the few games actually capable of scaring you if played in the right conditions doesn't actually merit a horror film, but there you go. Jovovich reprises her role from the first film, and is here backed up by game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory) and Carlos Oliviera (Fehr). The basic plot of the movie is that the three of them, along with a changing roster of hangers-on, have to both survive the city's undead and get out of the now-quarantined Raccoon City for reasons that the viewer's clued into about halfway through the movie. The result, as noted in the rating, is non-stop violence.

Given that, it's surprising how well the film does work on that level. The situation is quite likely to remind you of Predator, arguably the best film Schwarzenegger ever made (and definitely the best film Gov. Ventura ever made); Apocalypse suffers in comparison because the characters don't have anywhere near as much depth, but the action sequences never fail to be just as much fun. I just wish it had more of the outright creepy feel that made Resident Evil 2 (the game) so wonderful. ** ",3.0

"This movie isn't as bad as they say, has intrigue and mystery, an of course the gorgeous Milla Jovovich. The bad part in the movie it's when Milla begins to have flashbacks and the heavy metal music. Or the bad special effects of the lickers.

A very emotive movie with brilliant performance from both Nick Nolte and Barbara Streisand.  Streisand did make her character very saintly by giving up what meant most to her to allow some stranger to be happy.,3.0
"of ""Funny Girl"", Barbra Streisand has never been happy with anything less than an epic.  And here we have a Streisand-directed epic.  Her films (when she has a starring role and holds all of the cards) are long, drawn-out pieces that have the tendency to mystify an audience.  ""Prince"" is no exception.

So many unnecessary scenes flog us, beat us up, wear us down.  But it's Barbra.  There is NO connection between her and Nick Nolte, his last good role beofre the DUI and the mug shot heard 'round the world.  He's good enough, but my god I want to slap him in the face for going through all of this soap opera turmoil regarding his twin sister and toying with the idea of leaving his wife and children....

for Barbra.

She screams, she jolts around, she sighs, she moves.  She's supposed to be beautiful, and while she is no classic beauty (was Norma Shearer?) she at least has the decency to photograph and light herself well.  Sometimes too well.

The casting of George Carlin as the gay neighbor is way off base.  First, he isn't gay (in his personal life) and second, he is over-the-top gay and not so very funny for having been encouraged to act that way.  I'm surprised that Sreisand, ever the perfectionist, would have allowed this.

It's a long film, like all Streisand STREISAND films.  She's the star, we bought the ticket, and we'd better sit down, shut up, watch it, and to hell with the popcorn.  It's STREISAND!!!!

It's a magnificent attempt to bring a so-so bestselling novel to the screen.  But like the so-so bestselling novel, this is a so-so film.  And it is sooooo soooooo long.",3.0
"As a huge fan of the original games I came to the first Resident Evil movie with fairly large expectations.  Was I disappointed, a little.  As a horror movie it had its moments, as a movie based on a game it wasn't very great.  Although, to lend it some credit, Paul Anderson has said it was more of a prequel to the games rather than based exactly on the games.

Luckily Resident Evil: Apocalypse is based on the games and is a lot better done than the first one. First off, there's a lot more action. To me the first one was far to slow, with not much going on. This one was almost pure action through and through. It had great gun fights and well thought out fisticuffs.

It also played out like the games, with different scenes from the game actually in the movie, which I enjoyed. The Tyrant was well done and didn't look too cheesy like I thought it would.  The zombies were good, although the moments where the director chose to slow down the film to show groups of zombies moving was a total waste.  I couldn't help but think, ""cheesy TV movie"" during those times.  The dogs and lickers were well done, and there's nothing like a creepy classroom filled with zombie children to get some chills wrung out.

Milla Jovavich's character Alice was a big improvement too.  Jovavich had a better grasp of the character this time around and played her with some good old camp too.  She seemed more confident in the role, which worked for the movie.

My only real complaints about the movie where its lack of constant good scares, only one new addition of the monsters from the game(the Tyrant) and lack of gore. For a horror zombie movie you'd expect a little more gore.  Even Shaun of the Dead has more gore than this. But overall, it's a step above the original, and a gigantic leap over other zombie movies based off games.  Yeah, I'm talking about you House of the Dead.",3.0
"Most fans of the Resident Evil videogame series were disappointed by this movie.  I'm not entirely sure why but I found it to be a solid movie which never does anything really wrong.  The special effects are good, the acting isn't bad, the dialogue isn't stupid, the story is good, and there is a fair amount of scares.  All in all, the movie is a little generic and unoriginal but nothing is done badly.

The story is that a secret research facility known as The Hive resides below the city of Raccoon City and someone has unleashed the deadly T-virus within the facility.  This virus amongst other things has the ability to bring the dead back as zombies, flesh eating killers which have the ability to transmit the deadly virus by biting.  A highly trained group of ""special forces"" type guys are sent into The Hive by the Umbrella Corporation to figure out what happen.  Nobody outside knows why facility shut itself down.  The facility is still being controlled by the master AI, which needless to say is a little bit paranoid of the current situation.

In conclusion, I didn't regret watching this movie and have even enjoyed rewatching it several times.  There is no deep meaning, there are no awesome twisted character revelations, there isn't humor, there are no horrendous bloodbaths, but it is a decent action/horror movie that is an okay popcorn muncher.",3.0
"Directed by Barbra Streisand, who becomes Nick Nolte's Psychiatrist and eventual love interest, this cardboard cut out of a psychodrama does occasionally manage to rise above the category of dull and contrived. With so many predicable twists in its Freudian laden tropes, little is left to the aware viewer's imagination.

Nolte is a Southern divorcee and gentleman to be, running away from a cramped married life made even more miserable by a hidden family past involving a rape and murder, and a sister who mentally did not manage to survive it all. Streisand, using all of her Jewish New York savvy, business charm and a tool kit full of Freudian 101 psychoanalytic techniques, plus a predictable bad marriage, manages to both seduce and cure her handsome troubled Southern client. And in the process he is able to help his sister return her life to a semblance of sanity and normalcy.

Although the acting is much better than the script, which is thin, with a plot packed full of painfully predictable mini-Freudian psychodramas, it is nevertheless and interesting movie. Nolte at least gets to stretch his acting skills out well beyond the normal ""silent hard-drinking tough guy"" roles he is so used to. Three Stars",3.0
"Though released in 91, this looks like 1981. Nolte was still young enough to be appealing, but his hair in this one isn't his best look. Barbra is just terrible. Dated. Her acting ability is rough, at best. The clothes haven't worn well over the years. Neither has the hair. Ths plot is ridiculous. I've never heard of a psychiatrist quite like this one: she spends months trying to figure out what's wrong with Nolte's sister, by talking to Nolte? This doesn't happen in real life. Pat Conroy's novel was hot stuff way back when, but it hasn't stood the test of time. The scenery of Beaufort, SC, is gorgeous, however. Also, like many movies of its time, this is too long by 30 minutes.",3.0
"If you dug the first Resident Evil film, you'll most likely dig Resident Evil: Apocalypse even more.  Taking place right after the end of the first film, Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself allied with a few survivors as they try to escape Raccoon City and the unending zombie onslaught.  Paul W.S. Anderson, who had directed the first film, wrote this sequel which is capably directed by first timer Alexander Witt.  The bigger budget allows for better special effects, a more expansive environment, and the appearance of fan favorite video game monster Nemesis.  Video game characters Jill (the oh so hot Sienna Guillory) and Carlos (The Mummy's Oded Fehr) are introduced, and the solid cast is rounded out by Mike Epps, Jared Harris, and Thomas Kretschmann.  However, Apocalypse is really nothing too special, and at times it is quite predictable, although the twist ending is a nice touch, and the door is left open (again) to another sequel.  It's not a waste of film as Roger Ebert described it as upon it's release, but it will depend on the viewer whether or not this is worth a look.",3.0
"I liked the first ""Resident Evil"" better.  I liked the way it opened and the entire idea of people having to go back into the Hive to find out what happened and look for survivors.  There is something to be said for the inherent tension in having to keep going forward when you should be turning around and getting the hell out of Dodge as quick as possible.  ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is about the getting the hell out of Dodge, or in this case Raccoon City, but there is a major problem in terms of the as quick as possible part, especially given that the city is about to be nuked.

The Umbrella Corporation decided to reopen the Hive, which allows the T-virus to escape and turn the inhabitants of Raccoon City into zombies.  I might be slow when it comes to modern science, but I really fail to see the practical applications or economic potential of the T-virus given that it is not really regeneration human cells.  Now the nuke option is making a lot of sense, which is bad news for Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically created ultimate fighting machine, who is trying to lead a group of survivors through the zombies to safety.  But since this movie is based on a video game, things get worse.  The Umbrella Corporation sends Nemesis, a killing machine that may or may not be a genetically mutated version of Alice's boyfriend, Matt, from the previous film.  Apparently shooting people before nuking them is in the best interest of the corporation.  Go figure.

Alice at least has some decent allies this time around, with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a demoted cop who is pretty good given that she has no genetic enhancements, and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), who leads what is left of an elite tactical team.  Weather reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt) is as close as we get to the damsel in distress with this group, and she is not stupid.  The group has a glimmer of hope in that there is a scientist, Dr. Asher (Jared Harris), who created the T-virus and is wired into the city security system so that he can help them take the ""easy"" through zombie town.  All they have to do is rescue his daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), who was left behind.  So this is the ""Resident Evil"" equivalent of trying to get out of zombie town with one hand tied behind your back.

I understand that there are a lot of things in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" that are lifted from the various ""Resident Evil"" video games, but all of that is lost on me.  I am sure that this adds another dimension of enjoyment to the film, just like when I watch a ""Spider-Man"" movie and talk about what shots are taken from which cover by which artist.  A lot of this stuff is explained in the various commentary tracks, so there is ample opportunity to play catch-up, but it would all work a lot better if you have actually seen the video games.  The bad news is that the sequel seems much more like a video game as the survivors fight zombies, and then they fight mutant creatures, and then they fight the Umbrella Corp., and then they go through the whole cycle again.

Taking the movie out of the Hive and up to the streets works against the tension and the terror, even when you throw in the zombie strippers (yeah, it sounds like a good idea, but it really is not).  I think the characters are more interesting this time, mainly because their collective competence level is a lot higher than the first film, but this is yet another film that turns the lights down low and edits like crazy to achieve its effects.  I am so sick and tired of movies resorting to that approach instead of just letting us see what is going on.  But this is a movie that really does not have much respect for the intelligence of its audience, all of whom would know to shot zombies wearing body armor in the head.  At least the movie makes the videogames look really good in comparison, so there is that.  You just have to be into playing the games.",3.0
"The book was great, although the timelines were messy. I really enjoy Nick Nolte, that tough-guy creampuff, but he was too old, as was Blythe Danner. Barbra Streisand directed, & her first rule was ""Any shot I'm in is MY shot, so make sure I dominate that scene"". Melinda Dillon was OK, but Gwyneth Paltrow would have been far better. Of course, it's such a big, rich book that a mere commercial theatrical release could never do it justice, however, looking at this film dispassionately, Tom Wingo was the only character I cared about. By the way, why are George Carlin & Blythe Danner the only cast members listed in the Amazon header I've ever heard of? Nolte? Streisand? I'd think the stars should be listed. This happens frequently on Amazon",3.0
"The sequel to Resident Evil, Apocalypse pales in its shadow.  Resident Evil was a guilty pleasure that provided decent entertainment.  Milla Jovovich did a decent job of playing a action-heroine.  I only wish the sequel managed to achieve its predecessor's quality.

Milla Jovovich did manage to learn one thing about acting: she surrounded herself in the sequel with actors of such a caliber that in comparison is an Oscar caliber performance.  Yes, everyone else in the movie is that bad (although they do have wonderfully stereotypical accents).

The plot is also so disjointed to lose all logic.  First a virus is unleashed around the city so the evil corporation puts a wall around the city to keep the zombies in.  Makes sense so far, but for some reason they put mercenaries in the midst of the city for no discernable reason other then to provide ready victims.  And from there the plot continues to flounder.  What ultimately ruins plot is that is composed of specific action sequences taken from the games with a narrative designed to bridge the gap.  A big mistake.

The ending of Apocalypse (following the final battle) is the best part of the movie.  It promises a sequel that escapes the shackles of the game series.",3.0
"But I doubt it was a plot that someone like me was supposed was to understand in the first place! :) If I'd understood the plot a little better, I'd definitely be giving this four stars - the way it stands at the moment, it's borderline four stars. I think the plot was just a little too complicated for me!

I've never played the game, although I've watched it being played, so I recognised a few of the places, and got other places pointed out which were in relation to places in the game. I wasn't sure what it was about beforehand, but I loved the zombies! Of course people are going to draw comparisons with the original and remake of Dawn of the Dead, and Shaun of the Dead, as they feature heavily on the walking dead, but in this, there's new, inventive and very gory ways of killing people and the walking dead. Once again, the word zombie is never used in this movie, much like the other 'zombie' based movies. Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero was originally attached to write and direct, but left the project in 1999 due to creative differences over the script. The project was dormant for over a year before Paul W.S. Anderson signed on to write and direct the movie. This film was originally titled ""Resident Evil: Ground Zero,"" but the title was changed to just ""Resident Evil"" after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the USA.

And for the guys - Milla Jovovich gets naked! Which I got told about before the movie started. Do you see me caring?! It's also weird, because her character, Alice, never has her name spoken, written or identified until the end credits.

The scene with the lasers is definitely a scene you need to watch out for. It's so weird to watch, as you think they're OK, and then the bodies split apart in all kinds of ways! Ugh!

For some reason, I thought Mira Sorvino was in this, and had no idea who Michelle Rodriguez is, apart from the fact she scowls a lot. One of her lines is very funny, where she says she's going to get laid once this is over.

A newspaper in Racoon City reads 'The Dead Walk!' This is a direct reference to Day of the Dead, in which a newspaper at the beginning of the film reads the same.

I don't really know much about the director Paul W.S. Anderson, apart from this wasn't his first movie based on a video game - the first was Mortal Kombat. I know some people don't particularly like him, or his work, but I really liked his movie. I don't really pay much attention to how the movie is directed.

There's quite a few connections to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. These are: main character's name is Alice (an easy one to start with); computer is named 'Red Queen'; 'The Red Queen' needs to kill someone who is infected, so she tries to get someone else to chop off their head. (Off with her head!); Alice in Wonderland paperweight; a white rabbit was used to test the T-virus; to enter the hive they go through a mirrored door (through the looking glass); and the Red Queen also succeeds in cutting off ""her"" head - the medic in the laser hallway.

With a soundtrack done by Marilyn Manson, you kinda know what you're gonna get with the soundtrack for this, and it's surprisingly good!

The extras include: alternate ending with director Paul Anderson's video introduction; clip compilation: Resident Evil: Apocalypse; commentary by cast & filmmakers; visual effects commentary; costumes featurette; featurette: Playing Dead: Resident Evil From Game to Screen; scoring Resident Evil; set design featurette; storyboarding Resident Evil featurette; and 6 exclusive featurettes: The Creature, The Elevator, The Laker, The Trainm Zombie Dogs and Zombies.

This is a surprisingly good movie, and if you're unsure, I would definitely give it a chance. It's worthwhile. And if you're a guy, you'll probably be drooling over Milla.",3.0
"As a whole, Prince Of Tides appears, at first glance, as a more than decent film: the acting of both Nolte and Streisand is very, very good, with Streisand turning in one of her best roles which she might not be expected to play.  The storyline is excellent, with appropriate twists and turns and twists.
The problem with the film is this: it builds itself as a large, cinematic film, with it's grand music and it's seamless editing, and long sequencing.  And the film simply is not that: the music and editing are especially innapropriate, tinting the film to grand cinema, while it is actually rather dark and trimmed.  After building to an anti-climactic ending, the film suddenly ends, leaving the viewer with unresolved ends (Barbra and her husband, their son, Sally and her adulterer), and wanting more.  Had the film been created on a much less nostalgic and grand scale.",3.0
"With twice the budget, this movie is only half as good as the original Resident Evil.

The problem ?

Resident Evil like most ""Zombie""-related films get their appeal from the feeling of dread derived by being pursued relentlessly by massive hordes of living dead.

In Resident Evil: Apocalypse we get about 8 minutes of zombies at the beginning and 2 minutes at the end.

The rest of the movie revolves around our band of heroes fighting the Umbrella Corp. Security Team.

Call it ""Matrix Meets Resident Evil"".

Not as entertaining as the first by any means.",3.0
"I may be a bit cynical about the film version of a book I so immensely enjoyed reading.  Yet, while the book was a spellbinding page-turner, I found myself squirming through much of the film, especially once Barbra Streisand's nails began taking on a life of their own.  The character she portrays is quite secondary in the book, yet here is a central focus, as could be expected.  That said, Nick Nolte is fantastic in a role that earned an Oscar Nomination, and the supporting cast is uniformly fine throughout.  Also, as a director, Striesand does capture some moments of pure blissful perfection that made this an Oscar worthy best film nominee in 1991.  But, there are crucial elements of prose missing from the plot, and I found myself confused by unncessary devices like therapy sessions that showcase la Streisand in place of the story that needed to be told.  Martin SCorcese would have OWNED this film had he directed it.  Streisand, on the other hand, manages to inspire and cajole, but ultimately falls flat when trying to make sense of the characters.  To be sure, she is one of the few Legends when it comes to filmmaking and acting, but ""The Price Of Tides"" pales by comparison to other noteworthy efforts like ""Yentl.""  See it for Nolte, and then take the book to bed for an incomparable read!",3.0
"I loved Pat Conroy's book, The Prince of Tides.  I looked forward to the film version.  Nick Nolte was an inspired choice to play Tom Wingo.  I have no qualms with the rest of the cast.  I, too, wish that more of the story (of Luke especially) could have been told.  But, I have no major problem with the screenplay and the direction served the script fine.
My problem is that Streisand as producer and director should have read the damn book a little closer when it came to the character of Lowenstein, the psychiatrist.  She was described as upper-class, slim & dark,  cultured, refined & immaculate.  Now, Barbra may be interesting & intelligent....but classy and refined she ain't.  Not with footlong violet fingernails that would rival the Dragonlady's.  Maybe if I hadn't read the book, it would have worked...but I doubt it.
Casting in a movie is half the battle.  And that her ego allowed her to cast herself in this role says more about Barbra's delusions than it does her talent.  She told the story well, but the great love and understanding between Wingo and Lowenstein just wasn't believable for me between Nolte and Streisand.
Too bad, because she handled the rest of the movie pretty well.  I only wrote this because Barbra did a lot of bitching at the time that she was overlooked at Oscar time for Best Director.  I truly feel that had she cast that role to someone else and JUST directed, she would have made the list.  But, she had to make the movie a Barbra Streisand movie starring Barbra and thereby sank it rom potentially great to just a good film. Ego will get you every time.  3-1/2 stars.",3.0
"2 opinions about this movie

*** This comment may contain spoilers ***

the only way you'll like this movie depends on 2 things.........1 your unfamiliar with the games and/or you just want a good shoot em up zombie movie.but if your a fan of the games your gonna be brought to tears.the only thing that resembles the game are a few action scenes taken away from the games.and 4 characters from the game,jill,carlos,nicholai,nemesis.but their not fleshed out at all.which makes the casual viewer think that they never had depth to begin with which is so far from the truth it isn't funny.

also the creepy atmosphere of the game was utterly annihilated in the name of action.which WAS cool but in a cheesy way.nemesis could have been a great character till he turned into a [...] at the end. plus the one on one fight with alice is horrible if it had stayed a gun Battle then it would have been acceptable.

umbrella motives isn't fleshed out unlike the games.plus alice is really an intruding character sense she's not in the game she just doesn't fit.she messes up the dynamics of the original resident evil characters.its as if a girl wrote a fan fic and abruptly put herself as the center piece of the story.at least she should have stayed separate from the others going on her own path like another reviewer mentioned.also there's others that don't fit the lil girl,is a rewrite of another character central to the 2nd game,nicholai is also a very important player,as is carlos and Jill and S.T.A.R.S but like i said their not fleshed out.but if you haven't played the games do your own research to see what i'm talking about.because the adaptation inaccuracies are too numerous to mention here

now judging the game on its own merits.........if your just looking for a light action shoot'em up slash horror pic this might hold you over.though i must admit that the first movie did have a level of more darkness and tension then this one(though not much).but like i said all in all if your unfamiliar with the games and/or you just want a good shoot em up zombie movie this is for you.but if your a fan of the games your gonna be brought to tears.",3.0
"I had heard a lot about Resident Evil - Apocalyse before I had a chance to see the movie. Most of the folks I spoke to fell into one or two categories. They either loved the movie or hated it. I, on the other hand, had more ambivalent feelings. IMHO the first movie was much better. Though, Apocalypse does have some redeeming qualities...mainly the dead dogs are back in action. There is nothing better then zombie canines.

The movie picks up where the last left off. T-virus has spread and chaos reigns all over Raccoon City. The evil Umbrella Corporation is doing all it can to contain the virus, but it's spreading faster then anyone could imagine. In an effort to study the disease, and keep it from spreading, the corporation has sealed off the city. It's then that the real action begins.

Resident Evil is full of action. There a lot of things blowing up, bullets flying, and plenty of people dying and re-animating. Not to mention, there is a huge terminator-esque bio-weapon running around.

I didn't find the movie too trying. But, overall the entire venture was short on plot. Events, people and circumstances were left virtually unexplained. Most of the acting was sub-par and just when you think the movie is over it starts off with another crazy hypothesis. It's like the neverening story...and I mean this truly.

I wish I could give this movie more then three stars, but it just doesn't deserve it. Though, the soundtrack is again superb Milla J. returns as Alice. That in it of itself is worth something.",3.0
"Milla Jovovich's character from the first is back in Resident Evil Apocalypse. The first one ends with her and another survivor being taking in and genitcally altered. Which makes Jovovich a hell of a lot quicker and stronger. The plot in the sequel has her and other survivors stuck in Racoon city with zombies all over the place. A scientist says he can get them out of the city if they find his lost daugher there.

  There's tons of action in the movie and Jovovich is in great action form. The movie isn't anywhere near as being a good of a zombie movie as 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead or even....Shaun of the Dead. It's still fun though and even better than the first. I think critics such as Ebert & Roeper were way too hard on the movie. It ends making it obvious that a part 3 will be coming soon. Although I liked it, Dawn of the Dead ended making me wanna see more. Resident Evil Apocalypse's ending didn't really make me care whether there's another one or not. Then again part one's ending didn't make me wanna see more either...",3.0
"I thought this movie was ok.  I have never played the games, butI greatly enjoyed the first Resident Evil and I think this one was just as good.  I enjoyed the ethical issues pertaining to Umbrella's cover up stories, etc, and I think it had a lot to offer besides a ""bunch of good guys killing zombies"".  I also enjoyed Milla Jovovich in this film.  Is she Oscar-worthy?  Well, no, but if you're looking for an Oscar contender, this isn't Titanic, ok?  I forget that she basically has had zero movies and, from being a supermodel to an actress, I think she's doing a pretty good job.  Plus, how awesome is it that she's a girl and kicks so much butt?

  I definitely think this movie was worth renting.  In my opinion, it's not a waste of time.  I also, on a side note, thought 28 Days Later sucked in a big way, and the Resident Evil movies were much better.  How is 28 Days Later going to completely rip off Resident Evil and then call itself original?  At any rate, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this film.",3.0
"Sheesh, some of the reviewers for this movie must've thought they were gonna get The Godfather Part II or The Shawshank Redemption. I mean, come on...unless you've had your head in the sand, you oughta know Resident Evil: Apocalypse is nothing more than an action-horror popcorn flick based on the popular videogame. If THAT doesn't keep your expectations in check, then you must set yourself up for disappointment wayyyy too much in life. Anyway, I liked this sequel slightly more than the original, and I think it was because most of the action took place above ground...at times, I thought the original RE felt somewhat constricted, not fully capturing how large the underground facility really was. But this time, the effect is not just limited to (mostly) Umbrella employees in closed quarters, but the ""common folk"" of the entire Raccoon City perimeter as well, so you get a better perspective of just how out-of-hand things have gotten. The zombies, lickers, and devil dogs are back, and there's also a new troublemaker in town (the Nemesis). In addition to some of the characters, RE purists will recognize some locations and/or screen shots that pay homage to the game. Bottom line: good mindless fun, and a couple of sexy [...]-kicking heroines (Milla Jovovich & Sienna Guillory) never hurt either...there's always a time & place for movies like this. (FYI: The extra features are enormous & also worth checking out, my favorite being the commentary featuring a HILARIOUS Milla...BTW, even SHE knows it ain't Shakespeare) 3-3.5 stars.",3.0
"Wow!  This is one case where I definitely wish that Amazon gave reviewers the option of rating both the film itself and the extras.

This is because while ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is just a slightly above average sequel, the extras on this DVD offer hours of entertainment and are worthy of four stars on their own and maybe even five.

Let's start with the movie and some background on its history.

First, with the possible exception of snuff films, there is no film genre that commands less respect than that of the video-game based-movie.

It's not without good reason either. If you think of the video game based movies you've seen, odds are they all s@#$ed majorly. ""Super Mario Brothers""? Awful. Van Damme's ""Streetfighter""? Mediocre at best. ""House of the Dead""? Dumb.

Which is why when ""Resident Evil"" appeared in theaters in 2002 it was something of a small miracle. Not only was the film not bad it was actually very good. Smart, sexy, stylish, ""Resident Evil"" was the rare video game film that transcended its roots to become a highly enjoyable movie-going experience for both diehard gamers and regular viewers.

It also helped to revitalize the zombie movie genre, kicking off a resurgence of zombie and zombie-esqe films that began with ""28 Days Later,"" the new ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and the Brit comedy ""Shaun of the Dead.""

That trend continues now with ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse,"" which picks up right where the first film ended.

The bad news? RE2 is not as good as it's predecessor. The good news? It's still pretty good.

Returning for this installment is Milla Jovovich as Alice, sole survivor of the first film's series of events. Also, along for the ride is the luscious Sienna Guillory as S.T.A.R.S. officer, Jill Valentine, a name that will be familiar to fans of the ""Resident Evil"" video games. It's worth noting also that Guillory's resemblance to her videogame counterpart is so striking it's almost scary.

Other game characters also make their appearances here although some fans may be dissappointed that they are not featured as prominently.

Part of what made the first film work so well was the sure and inventive direction of Paul W.S. Anderson(""Mortal Kombat"", ""Aliens Vs. Predator""). Anderson's obvious love of video games seems to result in better than average film adaptations of them when he directs.

Anderson didn't helm this installment but new director Alexander Witt still manages to pull of some solid and occasionally stunning action sequences in this film. The church standoff, involving Alice and a trio of Lickers is especially memorable. Ditto Alice's run down the side of a skyscraper near the film's climax.

I'm only giving this film three stars though because it's flaws keep it from rising to masterpiece or even superb levels. Those flaws include:

Poor attention to characters - Though ""Resident Evil"" also boasted an ensemble cast, the writing and direction there were sharp enough to ensure that certain characters emerged as standouts. This is not the case here, where the ensemble just isn't balanced properly. Even Jovovich and Guillory don't get enough screen time and they are supposed to be the stars.

Not enough zombies - For a film that is supposed to be, at it's core, a zombie film, this movie offers far too few shots of the undead. When we do seem them they are often shot in shadowed, blurred slow motion.

Mike Epps - Mike, I loved you in the ""Friday"" sequels but if you're not careful you're destined to wind up as the Trimspa version of fellow Black comedian-actor Anthony Anderson i.e. the go to guy when a movie requires an annoying Black comic sidekick. Note to Hollywood: If you want to include Black characters in mainstream films try to make sure that they're well-rounded and have depth instead of the same tired, loudmouthed stereotypes we've been seeing for generations.

At least the movie explains why slim-framed Alice is able to pull off increasingly amazing feats of strength. Seems her exposure to the T-Virus is slowly evolving her to the point where she manifests superhuman powers. Where this storyline will take us, I have no idea.

Now for the extras.  Simply put, this DVD offers an impressive array of special features that will keep viewers busy long into the night.  You get, three, count 'em three commentaries, 20 deleted scenes, a six-part making of feature, and host of other goodies that amount to everything AND the kitchen sink.

Most interesting is the feature on real-world corporate malfeasance.  Rarely does schlock entertainment actually try to make you think.

I also love the fact, that this DVD release contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The ongoing trend of many studios releasing two different formats on separate discs fails to acknowledge many fans do like to have both versions and can't afford to shell out for the same DVD twice in order to have them.

While this is a great package there's no getting around the fact that the movie its wrapping is just a bit above okay.  In the end, I feel that movies like ""28 Days Later"" and the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" have raised the bar for zombie and zombie-like movies.  Anything coming afterward has really gotta step up its game.  ""Resident Evil:Apocalyse"" just didn't quite meet that challenge.

One thing I can say is that this film left me curious to see what happens in ""Resident Evil 3."" And if Sienna Guillory comes back for that one, consider my advance ticket already bought.",3.0
"The first 30 or so minutes of ""Resident Evil"" is everything you could really hope for in a horror movie: a clever, tightly-plotted, interesting story that keeps you on your toes and makes you wince a little -- in a delightful ""Oh man, I can't believe they went THERE"" sort of way -- every few minutes. The movie starts out fast and never really lets you get your footing, while it delivers punch after punch in a very effective progression. If only they could have kept it up the whole way through.

However, once the walking dead come out, everything goes downhill fast. And I don't mean in a good way.

The funny thing is, it shouldn't be like this. The majority of the concept of the video games that spawned the film ""Resident Evil"" is fighting zombies, and the games are fun to play. One would think that the film would manage to re-create this effect easily. It's the opposite that's true, however, as everything leading up to the appearance of the zombies is the best part of the film. Once the re-animated corpses actually start lurching out onto the main stage, it just gets sort of boring.

Mind you, ""Resident Evil"" did benefit from some rather good stuff. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez both add something unique to their roles. Butt-kicking women are something of a staple in video games and in action films these days, but these two make their characters into more than the stereotype, and they're fun to watch. Milla, in particular, has a truly unique quality about her which she brings to everything she plays, and its on display here too. The music played throughout the film sets the tone nicely. The little hints dropped throughout the movie for devotees of the game series (listen, for example, for a mention of ""Project Nemesis"") add a bit of fun to it.

But in the end, this could have been better any way you slice it. As a horror movie, it's not very scary. As an action movie, it's not that exciting. Judged against other, similar films (""28 Days Later"" for example), it comes in a bit lacking. Even when compared to its source, the video game by the same name, it doesn't quite measure up.

There are those who would say that movies based on video games are destined to failure, but I disagree. ""Resident Evil"" has the potential to make for a great film, even a great series of films. If you only look at the first 30 or so minutes of this movie, you can see where that potential lies. The fact that you can stop the movie once the first zombies stumble out of the shadows and not miss much of anything tells you where that potential fell short.",3.0
"Well...  There is not much one can say about the differences between the first and the second movie.  The budget was increased which made for a little more fun when it came to addressing the lack of actor talent, but the story line overshot the possibilities this movie presented.  I have played every Resident Evil game, read every book (soon including the newest one), and I put faith that the second movie was to be outstanding when the first one really wasn't bad.  Overall, I give this flick three stars and pray that the third, if there is one, is much better off.  Oh, nary I forget, if you are going to use actual character names, how about you get the personalities right.  Nicholai does not help out kiddies.",3.0
"I am a Resident Evil fan of the GAMES and as such, I have come to expect a certain...depth to my RE experience.  In the game, Zombies are the result of science gone wrong and, as a survivor of science gone wrong, your on screen avatar is expected to get to the bottom of it all.  In the first movie Resident Evil, much of this tone came through wonderfully.  Although there was plenty of shooting and running, the characters had to use intelligence to defeat the Red Queen defense computer and the genetically enhanced licker.  Alice was just a normal, albiet well trained, woman who finds herself in a horrible situation.  Thats Resident Evil to the tee.  So one can imagine my suprise and dismay when Resident Evil Apocalypse had none of this...

RE 2 manages to take a basically puzzle based psychological theme and turns it into a totally mediocre action film with all the overly done cliches and pointlessly unrealistic sequences.  Alice is no longer well trained, she's a ""super being"" with ""amazing powers"" of various forms.  True, even in the games this is not untrod ground but in the games the ""SPB's"" or super powered beings were the bad guys, forcing the all to human heroes to overcome their amazing powers.  The David to Goliath theme is a time tested and wonderful one that fits Re like a glove.  Why the writers chose to leave it behind is beyond me.

In this movie, one will see way too many obvious deaths and plot twists.  There are at least 6 instances of characters firing at a zombie just behind a human for the ""oh wow you saved me while looking like you were going to kill me"" effect.  There are also humerous instances of the ""suprise attack"" by zombies that seem to leap out of the framework to fall upon unsuspecting characters.  Added to the mix came main characters with such amazing pistol skills that they can hit a zombie in the head every time.  Ever since Mission Impossible Two directors have thought this is something audiences want to see but I for one am getting VERY tired of it.

But the absolute worst thing about this movie is the irreverant use of the Resident Evil characters in the game without any thought to who or what they are.  It is painfully obvious that the director chose to use Jill Valentine from RE 1 and 3 the game because she is a woman and can ""sex the screen up.""  Her intro to the movie has her walking into a police station and shooting zombies in the head without any explination of how she knows to do this or why she seems to be in trouble.  Sure, there is a bit of allusion to her disgrace but no explination.  Well folks...here it is.  Jill was part of the elite STARS unit that responded to a dusturbance at the Umbrella mansion and were nearly wiped out by the unleashed zombies.  When they tried to return with their story, Umbrella supressed it and made sure the STARS were disbanded.  When Racoon City slides into anarchy, Nemesis is unleashed to remove the surviving STARS as witnesses to Umbrella's complicity.  Now why could't they have had a montage in the movie with all that!  I, for one, would have enjoyed it more than the questionable action scenes and thin plot.",3.0
"Ok, I'll admit. I am a rabid fan of the resident evil series. I was  thrilled when the first movie came out, and was decently entertained by the first film. So, of course when I heard there was to be a sequel based on RE3, I was equally thrilled.

Err....then I watched it.

First off, there is way too much Milla. Granted, she was a good character for the first movie, because that movie was based on nothing in the games, and thus was believable to a point. But now, she's gone all Wesker on us, and is the superwoman of the movie. Please, please Mr. Anderson...stop giving the fanboys shots of Milla's miniscule chest, and give us the actual *game* characters in lead roles.

I did enjoy some parts. Nemesis was well put together, and rather authentic to the games. Probably the most authentic character of the movie, yet we don't see enough of him. D'oh. Carlos is, well, Carlos. Jill is not nearly the repectable S.T.A.R.S ass-kicker we all know and love, unfortunately. Nickolai is good now, and actually played well. (yay for Zach Ward!) Then there's alot of random plot-filling characters that are there as nothing more than zombie-fodder. That too...not enough zombie action. Sure, we see hordes of them in many shots of the city. But that's all there is, walking hordes. Not alot of the random jump-outs that are classic to the games. And, don't get me started on the Ashfords.

So, all-in-all, this was a good idea gone down the crapper. Some parts were decently done, but the majority was pasted together too sloppy. I guess Paul Anderson was too busy screwing with AvP to give this movie it's due credit.",3.0
"**Warning: Minor spoilers ahead**

Honestly.  What can I say about this movie?  If you've seen the trailers for Resident Evil: Apocalypse, or have seen the first Resident Evil movie, then you know what kind of movie you're in for.  Anyone expecting a deep storyline (although I think most movie goers are smart enough not to expect one) would be advised to look elsewhere.  Apocalypse is a B-movie through and through.  It's heavy on fight scenes with gun-fighting, explosions, blood splattering, and limbs being broken every minute, with plot and dialogue taking a back seat.

Apocalypse's story is pretty standard fare.  It takes place soon after the events of the first Resident Evil movie.  A virus has spread through Raccoon City, turning its inhabitants into flesh eating zombies.  Those who have not yet been infected (i.e. the main characters in the movie) have to find a way out of the city while surviving the onrush of a zombie horde, and a super-zombie called the Nemesis.  In most B-level zombie movies you wouldn't expect the acting to be all that great...and this movie is no exception.  I don't blame the actors however.  Milla Jovovich (who plays Alice) and the rest of the cast try to make the best of the movie's stilted dialogue with varying degrees of success.

However, my main problem with the movie is that the plot is not much more than a string of `money shot' sequences that make no real sense.  One prime example of this is during the fight at the church.  Jovovich's character smashes through a stain glass window on a motorcycle and saves the lives of the humans inside.  A few problems with that whole sequence include: 1) How did she know what was going on inside the church?  2) How did she know exactly where to land?  3) Why didn't she just go through the front door?  Apocalypse is filled with many horror movie clichs (i.e. going into a dark room alone in a zombie infested building) where you know someone is going to die.  Also, there was one scene where Alice and the gang walk through a graveyard to try and escape the zombies.  Of all the places you could go to hide from the walking-dead, why in the world would you go into a graveyard?!  Now, you're probably asking why the heck I would expect a coherent story in a zombie movie?  Because it has been done before.  Movies like 28 Days Later have shown that zombie movies could have strong dialogue, character development, and a good plot.

The one bright spot in this movie is that if you want to see a ton of zombies get shot up, than Resident Evil: Apocalypse delivers in spades.  The action Apocalypse is non-stop, especially when the Nemesis shows up.  Speaking of the Nemesis, I can't help but like the design of Nemesis' costume, and seeing him blow up everything with his rocket launcher and chain gun was pretty darn cool.

The fact is, if you liked the first Resident Evil, than you will definitely like Apocalypse (and I should note that the ending leaves room for another sequel).  Personally, I thought that Apocalypse was actually better than the first movie, but frankly that's not saying much.  If you want to see a good zombie movie, I suggest you check out 28 Days Later, or Dawn of the Dead (either the 1978 or 2004 version which I have not yet seen, but I hear is quite good), and wait for Resident Evil: Apocalypse to come to DVD and rent it instead.

I give Resident Evil: Apocalypse a 6 out of 10.",3.0
"I had very low expectations for this movie after watching the disaster that was the first Resident Evil movie.  The first Resident Evil movie failed on so many levels: as a horror movie, as an action movie, and most importantly as a decent movie.  A great deal of this failure was due to the poor director selection and the lousy script.  The director, Paul W.S. Anderson directed this movie in a manner that showed both a blatant disrespect for the source material and a poor understanding of the same source material.  As a result of the aforementioned things the original Resident Evil movie featured lousy camera work, the worst special effects since the Power Ranger television program, bad acting, an awful plot, and a painfully loud sound track.  The people who were probably the most disappointed with this mess of a film were the game fans who watched a ground breaking and frightening game series with an intriguing plot and great characters nearly have its movie life slaughtered on the first go round.

With that being said, a drastic improvement for the second Resident Evil movie was that Anderson decided to work on Alien vs. Predator (which by the way is a run-of-the-mill movie) and left the directing in the hands of a much more capable director Alexander Witt.  Instead of going for suspense and horror of the games Witt directed the film in a non-stop action manner.  This movie unlike the first movie also features characters from the game: Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera, Nicholai Sokolov, and the Nemesis B.O.W. (Bio Organic Weapon).  This time around there's also some comic relief provided by the funny Mike Epps and there are a few locations and scenes taken straight out of the game.  The inclusion of characters from the game, having a few locations from the game, and featuring some scenes out of various Resident Evil games may possibly appease some of the loyal game fans to some degree.

While this movie is so much better than the original movie it still has it share of problems.  The first and main problem with the movie is that Anderson is the screenwriter.  With that being the case the movie has no character development whatsoever.  This prevents the audience from truly caring about the characters.  Also Anderson's script centers around Alice (played by model Milla Jovovich) who by the way has nothing to do with the game and the plot of the movie doesn't follow the plot of Resident Evil 3 and the movie is supposed to be a movie version of that game.  The plot that Anderson creates for the movie is mediocre at best.

The special effects have improved a great deal over the first movie's laughable effects but they still are lacking.  The zombies do not look scary in the least bit.  This is really sad especially since there is a cemetery scene in the movie that features zombies coming out the grave who can't compete with the zombie make-up used in Lucio Fulci's 1980 film Zombi (alsos known as Zombi 2) that features some really nasty looking zombies coming out of a graveyard.  In fact the zombie make-up in Resident Evil can't compete with a lot of zombie flicks: Dawn of the Dead Remake, and Day of the Dead just to name a few. Even Michael Jackson's Thriller video features better zombie make-up than this movie.

There is also some inaccurate information provided by the movie.  Some of the inaccuracies include crediting Dr. Ashford as being the creator of the T-virus. Also in the movie the T-virus was supposedly created by Dr. Ashford to heal.  If you have ever played the game or like it as Anderson claims he does then he should have known that both of these things are complete nonsense and should never have been written in the script.  The S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team is also represented in a false manner in the movie again Anderson's poor understanding of the games and disrespect are shown by the way they are presented.

Oh, well I can only hope that if there's a third movie that the plot is related to that of Resident Evil:  Code Veronica since the series appears to be going in that direction and this would be the next logical step.  I pray that the studio executives wise up and loose Anderson from the production and replace him with a competent screenwriter and that the main focus of the story is no longer Alice.  I also hope that they include the characters of Albert Wesker, Chris Redfield, and Clare Redfield in the next movie.

Most importantly I hope that the Resident Evil production team for the games wises up and decides to work closely with the studio producing the Resident Evil movies much like Konami Corporation is working with the production team to produce a movie version of the incredible Silent Hill game.  If they had done this in the first place all of the millions of Resident Evil game fans who shelled out their hard earned cash to purchase game after game or the various other Resident Evil merchandise could've made the movie a mega blockbuster.  Not only that but it also would have helped to increase interest in the games by people whose only contact with Resident Evil was the movie.  It may have even generated renewed interest in Resident Evil with jaded fans.  All of these things together would have ultimately helped the game make more money.",3.0
"""Apocalypse"" picks up right where this first ""Resident Evil"" left off.  In fact, it backtracks a bit to explain how the ending of the first came about.  And then, we are off, as Alice (Jovovich) hooks up with some others (Guillory, Holt, Fehr) trapped in the city.  The city has been locked down because the virus from the first movie has gotten out of the Hive.  The group is offered assistance in getting out if they can find and rescue the daughter of an Umbrella Corp. employee.  Added incentive comes in the form of a nuclear cleansing of the city that is on its way.  Along the way, they will deal with zombies, more of the creatures from the first movie, and the Nemesis (a really big, ugly mutant with a creepy smile).

""Apocalypse"" falls short of the confined terror of the first film.  The underground nature of the original added to the rising tension, while here the players have the run of the city.  Plus, to some extent, there is not much new here.  The Nemesis is a creepy adversary, but he introduced fairly early on, and his eventual end is no surprise, given the events of the first film.  There is also another cliffhanger of sorts at the end to set up another sequel.

Chances are, if you liked the first film, you will like this one as well.  If you did not like the first one or avoided it completely, you would be better off looking elsewhere for entertainment.  What you think you will get out of this film is exactly what you will get.  I liked it, but only enough to recommend on DVD.",3.0
"Back in the day before I became a fan of music and movies I was constantly in front of a TV playing a video game. Years have passed and my attention span for games has seems to grow thinner and thinner with time. It takes a really good game nowadays to hold my attention long enough to get through it. I never played the Resident Evil games back when they were in their prime (though I guess they never really died out). I came back and played both Resident Evil 2 and 3 much later on. I found myself strangely fascinated with both games and ended up beating them.

A lot of you might already know this but it wasn't until a little while later that I was informed that both games occur at the same time, hence the concept for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Be that as it may, both games have thier very own story lines. In Resident Evil 2 it is a split story between R.C.P.D. (Racoon City Police Department) officer Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield both trying to find their way out of the city. Claire is also on a mission to find her brother Chris (who made an appearance in the first Resident Evil game). Various other characters fall into their mismatched story that makes up Resident Evil 2. In Resident Evil 3 the lead role goes to Jill Valentine who, believe it or not, is trying to get out of Racoon City. Farfetched, I know. Through her journey she encounters a group of mercenaries led by Nikolai Ginovaef. The other two are Carlos Oliviera and Mikhail Victor. The catch with this game is it consist of frequent encounters from Nemesis, a beast of a monster set out to kill the S.T.A.R.S. members.

But this isn't a video game review, that was just some background info going into the movie. The movie's main character is Alice who is awakened on a lab table where she was put at the end of the first Resident Evil movie. Also struggling to get out of the city is Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera and a few other characters. After they all cross paths they are sent on a mission to find a scientist's daughter with the agreement he'll tell them how to get out of town if they find her. Also thrown into the mix to complicate things is the Nemesis and a few angry Umbrella Co. guys who are dead set on not letting anyone escape the city.

Where they decided to throw Alice into the mix I'm not sure, but it makes for a few good action sequences. Since the first movie, Alice has been given some type of chemicals that have now made her 'superhuman'. 'Superhuman' meaning she can do crazy things such as flips, jumps, run up walls, run at super speed and possess an unlimited amount of ammo.  So since she's with the team this means that they can bash as many zombies as they please and wipe the blood off and move to the next area where they, get this, kill more zombies.

There's nothing original about this flick and they could've done a much better job at combining the games together (since both had a very subtle story attatched). However, throughout some of the slop they've piled on they manage to work the obvious cliches we've grown to hate (going off into a room alone, monster behind the door or behind a character, etc.) they actually work them pretty well. The movie is a decent effort if you compare it on it's own merit (not along side the games) but becomes way too farfetched for it's own good before it's over.

If you know what you're getting (which is a done over zombie flick) and go in with low expectations then you just might enjoy it. If you expect not to be scared you might get a few jumps. A good one time through movie that unfortunately leaves a bit of a sour taste in your mouth before it's over, I give Resident Evil: Apocalypse a 6 out of 10 (or 3.5 stars).",3.0

"""Resident Evil"" is actually a pretty cool movie.  I've never played the game(though I've been aware of it since it originally came out), so I don't have anything outside of the actual movie to base this review on.  I was expecting a mediocre action yarn about zombies run amok.  What I got was a lot better than expected.  Milla Jovovich is good as the brains/beauty heroine of this flick.  She's very believable.  Michelle Rodriguez is also good as the tough-as-nails soldier.  The rest of the cast does a very good job(including the walking dead).  The story is pretty good considering that it is based on a video game.  I'm assuming that the game is just as complex and confusing with its plot.

I spent the first minutes of the film confused about what was exactly going on, which probably happened to everyone who hasn't played the game.  Once the plot has been set, though, the movie is easy to follow and the action is very good.  The soundtrack is fitting for a movie like this.  It has a horror/techno vibe to it, not unlike ""Blade.""

As stated before, the action is very good.  It is paced just right and there are very few lulls in the action once the movie gets rolling.  The special effects are good, but are sort of awkward at times.  The mutated creature looked pretty fake due to some ""Mortal Kombat""-type CGI.  Both films shared the same director, so that doesn't surprise me.  This film is, however, superior to ""Mortal Kombat.""  One thing that impressed me the most about this film is that it had slick set design and good lighting.  Most films in this genre tend to darken things up a bit in an attempt to hide flaws in the special effects.  ""Resident Evil"" lets you view all of the action, even though some of it is looks a bit fake, in great lighting.  No squinting to do, which is a good thing.  That's one of the main reasons I let some of the CGI screw-ups slip by.

The horror aspect of this film was basically a lot of ""jump-at-you"" scares.  I enjoyed that, but I feel that this movie is better categorized as an action flick.

As far as the DVD goes, the special features were par for the course on this type of film.  Lots of ""making of"" segments, which were fun to watch, are included.  There's also a filmography of the main characters and the director.  The free ticket to ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" was also a nice touch, and I'll definitely go check it out.

Overall, a nice action flick that does good for the Milla Jovovich machine.  It's worthy of multiple viewings, but if you aren't into action/gore films, you may want to avoid this one.",3.0
"Okay, this movie wasn't the best, but like other sequels released this summer (i.e. Alien vs. Predator, Anacondas 2, etc.) this one was better than the original. The acting was given a much better tweaking, the monsters were maybe a little scary this time, and though the story still stank the action wasn't that bad. I'd give Resident Evil 1 a * 1/2 star rating, Resident Evil 2 earned a ** in my book. Not good, but better.",3.0

"I saw this film once and once was enough. As a secular free-thinker but  Catholic as a child I was taught Jeanne was a saint. Even now, she remains a puzzlement. ntil lately, I could find no objective books about her until I found a book by Frances Gies and other sensible historians (not dramatists) who presented this heroine in a most objective and respectful historical account. Hero tough, unshakeable faith in what she believed  caused her to go to crown Charles the dauphin as Charles VII of France, and to accomplish this she will have to lead an army and raise the siege of--and defeat the English in--Orleans. On that pathway she carried a banner and inspired thousands by proving herself. The film title Messenger does not suit her; more likely it should have been titled The Battle Within. If Jeanne had behaved in real life as she did in the film she would never been put at the head of an army--in fact Robert de Baudricourt would never have outfitted her to go to war but sent her home under guard. Milla Jovovich did a great job of playing a hysterical schizophrenic, not Jeanne D'Arc.

In the 1400s medieval males, essentially the English army, believed women who were with soldiers were prostitutes. In most of the films about her she was were portrayed, (though erring on the side of religious mysticism)  her as someone with, along with excessive piety, still had some common sense, a very loving, confident, and brave girl (she begins her ""assignment"" at age 17) with no riding or battle experience, is illiterate, and of the people, she never forgets the goal, in short, a believable leader. In The Messenger if it was meant to be analytical they miss the mark by a mile. She is portrayed as a hypertensive, hysterical, half scared Jeanne who, when finally realizing she is doomed to a horrid death, sees her ""conscience"" or some Guy in Black, come into her cell and tell her in effect that she got the wrong message and the joke is on her. As other reviewers who share my disappointment in this film have stolen my thunder and I applaud them for it, I will not repeat what is already intelligently opined.

But when I saw Dustin Hoffman come barging into her already doomed condition, playing what seemed a Bad Guy, or a spoiler,the ""devil"" or god or a conscience, some unnecessary addition, it really made me shake my head. Years later, after reading the IMDB-presented dialogue  between Jeanne and Hoffman on line, telling her she never heard anything she didn't want to hear, I was plain disgusted. Sure, Hoffman was a good actor in a cameo role and can do no wrong EXCEPT agree to appear as this creepy guy who symbolizes something sinister. Well, I knew why I had stopped watching the movie: because at is precisely where it should have ended  Because that would have added everything up just fine. We all know from history the trial was rigged and that she was burned at the stake: her decision to resume male attire was her downfall--she was attacked by guards when she wore women's dress designated h er as relapsed. She was a true innocent in real life and did what she believed and was portrayed woefully wrongly. What a shame, they got Jeanne all wrong for the sake of titillating entertainment.",3.0
"This is an...alright adaptation. There are much worse. The action scenes are cool, and the effects are pretty cool, but the zombies look pretty tacky. They aren't the half rotted brown sacks of maggot covered flesh that infest the game. They're these pale white half rotten things with no maggots at all! And where in the game does the Licker mutate?! That was ALL messed up!!! And some parts in this movie just suck, like when Kaplan dies(he's the best character), and when Milla Jovovich ends up being the last one to live. I don't care how hot she is or how unbelievably awesome she looks naked, the last person standing theme of horror movies is WAY too cliched!!! This movie is reccommended for someone who's a die hard fan of the video game series and/or headbangers(like myself).",3.0
"It is true that the story herein is, to those of us who went to Catholic or other Christian schools, and enjoyed theology and study it long after graduation would be annoyed by this film. Among my 8 majors in undergraduate school was one in Theology, which I loved.
Having said all of that, this is a Movie, not a Theologian examination, and in my experience with writers, directors, and producers  often know little of history, or theology. Their goal is entertainment, drama, and creativity. Over the agegis the stories  of such events have changed any number of times, and misunderstanding that regardless of religion the churches tend to recreate and wright out anything they  think may damage their saints. In recent decades the story of ""Joan of Arc"", (incidentally Her surviving signatures are all spelled ""Jehanne"" without surname) have been slaughtered and changed. Never the less, the vast majority of movie goers probably have never read the books of saints, and go out to the movies to see a good action film.
Personally, though I liked the movie, despite that it was short, and left a good deal of ""Jehanne's"" story was not even mentioned in this film, it was filled with action, and somewhat exciting. In French her name is today always rendered as ""Jeanne d'Arc,"" reflecting the modern spelling of her first name. My biggest problem with the movie is the price's of the DVD's which are, in my book are outrageously high, especially for younger people.",3.0
"This movie looks pretty interesting compared to the other Resident Evil. The only problem with the last movie, is that it couldn't reach its full potential since the budget was cut short. I will admit something, Paul Anderson is good at budgeting, but he is not that great at what he does. The problem with this upcoming movie, is that it is not following what the video game had. This movie needs to have a better story line that goes a long with the movie. One of the things that bugs me, is that Jill doesn't work along side of Alice. What I believe he should've done is made a diffrent story line, and put nemesis in it, but not jill, carlos, and nicolai. I believe if he would've stuck with a diffrent story line with diffrent people, and left nemesis in there, this would be a GREAT Movie! But see, the problem with the upcoming movie, is that first off, Nicolai is not the squad leader like he was in RE3. Why not? Why is Carlos the leader now? Also, the licker NEVER showed up in RE3, its debut was in RE2 and then they no longer were brought in. So why is the licker a main choice for this? Possibly if the budget is dephiseted? Well anyway, I will go see this movie, but I do not believe it to follow the video games like it should. But maybe Paul will make a movie revolving around Claire Redfield... That would truly be a masterpiece... But for now, we shall see what this movie shows.",3.0
"I'm a huge Resident Evil fan, and have trouble disliking anything related to the series (I even thought that RE survivor for PC was pretty good). This movie on the other hand was a let down for me. Gone is the creepy atmosphere, the feeling of suspence, and the over all fright factor the game created for so many. This has instead been replaced with a slick sci-fi-action movie with some sub-par acting and some reasonable special effects. The movie follows the game's story VERY loosly (there are still zombies, there are still guns, there are still STARS comandos, there is a high-tech lab, and they threw in the Licker monster from RE2....thats about it), which is one of the main reasons I was disapointed with this film. Many of the fans know and love the twisting, mysterious story of the orrigional game, and it has been replaced with a movie that is remanesent of Starship Troopers (not that this is particularly bad, but it is a huge change from the orrigional story). All-in-all, this was not a bad movie by any means, and is a fun action flick that you should at least rent, however, I believe RE fans will be some what disapointed. If you have no idea what Resident Evil is, or have never played any of the award winning games, you will probably enjoy the movie a lot more.",3.0

"I find that as I view this film over and over again that their just a mixture of feelings towards the film. At first I tend to focus on all the wrong like most people do. The movie completely transforms and warps Joan's childhood. There was no attack on her village and she never witnessed her sister getting raped that part is clear. As for the giant spinning propellers,although they might make for an awesome scene, are completely false to the times of which the period is placed. The las and most important falsehood given in the film is the way we view Joan herself. In the movie we witness her as the extremely hot headed border line luney bin character. Where as it is reported many times in history that she was calm and actually quite most of the time. By the director changing Joan's childhood it makes it seem as if most of the reason Joan is doing this is for hidden revenge. Although all these are pretty heavy crimes against history they do manage to add some historical accurate details into the film. The use of muder holes and other siege weapons (trebuchet, siege ladders, siege towers) all of these are well displayed within the movie. So if your going to buy this film it comes down to what you want in this movie. If your an action packed awesome fight scenes kind of person you'll love the movie for what it is. Which I do have to admit is a beautiful piece of work, completely wrong in many ways, yet beautiful. However, if you are a history buff who likes his movies to follow the time period. well you may be disappointed. Thats why i rated it a 3.",3.0
"Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.
With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.
The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.
Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.
The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clichd Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.",3.0
"Based on the hit survival horror video game series from which it gets its name, Resident Evil does an adequate job of setting up a film franchise, but does practically nothing with the rich world available to it from its source material - it's all set-up and no follow through.  Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson does keep the pace brisk and the film uncluttered with too much detail, but a little more shading in the character department would have been nice, and having the two people who should know more about the facility than they actually do because of a nerve gas induced amnesia is just a dirty (and lazy) little cheat, narratively speaking.  Also the movie too often resembles other, better movies (i.e. Aliens, Dawn and Day of the Dead, etc.) instead of the games upon which the movie is supposed to be based.  Weak script aside though, the movie is visually exciting and fun to watch in its own way.  It just isn't the moody and scary experience the games are.  Hopefully the inevitable sequel will be an improvement and not another semi-successful missed opportunity.  For Resident Evil fans only.",3.0
"What to say about RESIDENT EVIL? Well, the film's director, Paul Anderson, is probably one of the most hated directors in Internet land and while I don't hold as harsh of an opinion on the man as many do, I still don't think he's anything great and I definitely don't think he is qualified to direct his next feature, ALIEN VS. PREDATOR. Anyway, that's beside the point. How did Anderson do with the adaptation of one of the most popular video games of all time? Unlike its video game turned big screen adventure predecessor TOMB RAIDER, RESIDENT EVIL isn't a total waste. However, at the same time, for as much action and danger as the story tells us is going on during the film we don't really see all that much happen.
 What RESIDENT EVIL does well though is the way it thrusts us into what we are able to see happening. In the first five minutes, several people are dead and we are introduced to the lovely and very naked Milla Jovovich who stars as the films lead character, Alice. Granted, RESIDENT EVIL doesn't break any new ground whatsoever with the things it shows us. The things we see throughout the film are actually borrowed from several other movies ranging everywhere from DAWN OF THE DEAD to ALIENS to that Bridget Fonda LA FEMME NIKITA movie. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun to watch them again does it?
 I admittedly don't know that much about the video games of RESIDENT EVIL other than the fact that I know there are zombies in them so I don't know if the film is faithful to the video game or not. What I do know is that as shallow as it is, I had a pretty good time watching RESIDENT EVIL. While the film may be brain dead, it's still fun, popcorn munching entertainment.

"Aside from the great battle sequences (two scenes of which never took place- Joan jumping her horse over the barricades and her use of her sword in combat---she was never close enough to do so) and some remarkably choreographed pageantry (the least of which was the anemic coronation scene) the movie was generated from an occult perspective; obviously a product of scant authentic theological knowledge. There was no rape scene (of her sister), and Joan was never without conviction regarding her supernatural experiences---and she used this quality well, being actually in command of the entire French army. Motivated by the Holy Spirit, she was never hysterical as is Milla Jovovich's character--frequently. Her ""conscience"", played by Dustin Hoffman was really a part Satan would relish as this character spread as much depression and suicidal hopelessness as it did sparse and dubious counsel. The direction of the film was extremely well done, as the scenes virtually leapt right out of the screen. The choreographic aspects of the scenes were also outstanding. These two dynamics were the two standout points of the film. The acting was also in the standout category with Jovovich taking the lead. A pity it is that a proper theological genesis was not applied to the screenplay; a vicarious fulfillment that would have made the film great rather than somewhat reminiscent of so many demoniacal matinees. The musical score was also outstanding but not all original, using or imitating at least one cut from Einhorn's Voices of Light, the original composition created for Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc.",3.0
"Historical inaccuracies, anachronisms and Besson's interpretation of Joan of Arc prevent this from being a great film.  Instead it's merely entertaining and gratuitously violent. Joan was never near battle as a child, had no older sister and never succumbed to, what would be mad behavior, by modern standards. It makes the viewer wonder why Besson, a Frenchman, would bother.  Jojovich is credible, but tied by the director's vision of a ranting and revengeful mad woman.  I saw a preview trailer that was simple (the child Joan swinging a sword in a field, topping off flowers) that was more evocative than the film.  Too bad, as this could have, with more thought and care, been a classic biography.  For more accuracy and feeling, see the television miniseries with Leelee Sobieski.",3.0
"Honestly when I first thought about buyig this disc I had reservations. One being that it's based off a Japanese video game called ""Biohazard"" suitably renamed ""Resident Evil"" for the states. Two I didn't know any of the actors except for Mill Jovavich and I did like her performance in The 5th Element.
I however went ahead and bought the movie. To my surprise the flic wasn't bad at all. I expected certain things to be ""stolen"" from other flics especially in the horror genre but then again they're all rehashes of each other really. The story was good and the CG kept up with what the director wanted to portray. Don't expect a whole lot from Resident Evil but it's worth placing in your collection definately. I know you have worse titles in there already so at least you're on your way up with this one. If I had to recommend another recent horror flic over this one I would have to say that would be ""Event Horizon"". This movie is truly a modern classic and I would recommend it to anyone who loves the horror genres.",3.0
"Having done extensive research and study into Joan of Arc, this film is loaded with historical flaws. It appears to be the Director's personal fantasy of Joan. He portrays her as ""wacked out"" or a ""mental case"". He introduces a murder/rape which never happened as a motivator for Joan. He also plays ""Hollywood"" with many other non-facts. They could have produced a film, following the actual facts, which would have amazed audiences.
I have it as a part of my collection to use for comparisons. If you just watch it for visuals and entertainment, it is fine.",3.0
"While the movie proves entertainment if you are looking for a historical movie this isn't it.  Joan's talks to G-d and the saints make her seem as if she had a psychological problem, and seveal scenes make her look demonic.

"I love St. Joan of Arc, but this movie doesn't accurately depict her or her life's story with accuracy! I'd give any St. Joan movie 5/5 stars anytime, but this one portrayed St. Joan as somewhat ""mad"". St. Joan wasn't always an angry, raving girl with looking to pick a fight with everyone around her! Wrong depiction of a historical figure from director Luc Beeson!

If you like sensational Hollywoood movie war scenes and computer graphics,
watch this movie.

OK, look, it has a good opening start! Modern people want to see ancient maps and history. It's awesome to see how movie showed audiences what happened, when and where at the very graphical opening start of the movie, and how St. Joan begin her life's story at the time of war. I'd give 5/5 stars on how this movie was told at the start, but everything else seems to go downhill from the second half.

Don't be lazy, go read decent historical books about St. Joan instead if you want to study her.

If you need to watch a modern movie about St. Joan, I'd recommend watching ""Joan of Arc"" (DVD) starring actress Leelee Sobieski (she looks like actress Helen Hunt). Her saintly aura shines out more in Leelee Sobieski. Her body type also more or less accurately depicts how the historical St. Joan may have looked like.

Milla Jovovich, my Lady, continue on with your ""Resident Evil"" series and sexy ""Ultraviolet"" movie roles! You fare much better in sci-fi action movies. You disappointed me, your fan, in this role as a saint! Throw the director's silly script aside, read the books on St. Joan, get inside her head while transporting yourself back to her world, then start acting as St. Joan in the 21st century.

Too bad the French have forgotten one of their famous saints these days!

Can someone competent make an epic Hollywood blockbuster of St. Joan?",3.0
"Alright, you put in your copy of ""The Messenger"", and the movie begins. If you're a fan of Joan of Arc, and expect to see a fresh, accurate portrayal of the peasant-turned saint, then you're in for a surprise.

It's a common error, which I made myself. But after watching it, I gained a different perspective on the later life of Jeanne D'Arc.

While the movie stands as inaccurate in many areas, it gets you closer to Jeanne D'Arc than other movies will by raising the question of doubt, self worth, fear, and over all blind faith. Instead of just handing you joan of arc on a plate, ready to eat, this movie says ""Who is Jeanne?"" This movie takes you in the direction of ""What if?"" rather than saint hood. It asks ""What else?"" instead of feeding you glory.

Other than some risky directing by Luc Besson (made me laugh at times) and some weak character development, it's a definite watch for anyone who loves a good drama, and anyone who wants to get a different look at the famous saint.",3.0

"Milla Jovovich, personally, is an actress I like a lot, so my review is slanted right from the start. But the movie is really well filmed, in my opinion. Excellent war scenes with medieval war devices seldom seen in any other movie. A number of the aspects of warfare and armaments in The
Messenger were portrayed quite accurately and a few military historians, including Kelly DeVries, have commented on such. It had great visuals, in my opinion very good acting on everyone's part. Milla Jovovich's acting was superb in my opinion, and why the knee jerk negativity from people parroting everyone else saying ""she's a model, she can't act"" is just too lemming like to avoid being sadly humorous. I've watched it three times over the last few years and I own the DVD. Very good cast. The general and his troops were excellent. It's so typical of French history, too, lose most of your battles, finally find someone who leads you to victory, and then betray her and let your enemy burn her at the stake. I think at least a few of the negative reviews are from French apologists.",3.0
"Ok I am a huge Resident Evil fan.... I have all of them except RE:Gaiden and RE:Survivor...(survivor I hear sucked)...
If you are a huge Resident Evil fan this may not make you very satisified.... The reason why is because only certain parts of the game are in it. For instance, Zombies, The T-Virus, Umbrella Corporation, and a small scene of Raccoon City, oh and the Licker from Resident Evil 2. But see, just because they have all these things doesn't mean that it's going to be as great as playing the game because the movie really is just like playing the game because all you do is walk around this place called ""The Hive"" and try to disable the Red Queen. Now what would've been VERY smart is if they would've had Stars Alpha team be the people who investigated because the other people worked for Umbrella, which kind of made me angry because I hate the Umbrella in the game! They make me so mad with all those lies but hey it's just a game... Ok now here are the facts..
PROS:
Very nice Commentary w/ Milla Jovoich (Actor), Michelle Rodriguez(Actor) , Paul Anderson (Director), Jeremy Bolt (Head Producer).
Very good acting, I personally liked Milla Jovoich's kicks and moves, she's good!
Enough Action to satisfy anyone... Lots of Zombies
CONS:
The parts of the game they put in here are not very well designed, for instance, The Licker. The Licker is the weird bizarre creature we find in Resident Evil 2 on the ceiling of a Police Station in Raccoon City. Well see the thing is that this Licker design in the movie is not completely a clone of the one from the game, so it's not quite like The Licker you'll see in RE:2.
Not well Budgeted..... This movie was not well budgeted and here is why... When you see that lady in the elevator about to get her head chopped off after the T-Virus is released, why don't they show the head get chopped off? LOL Michelle Rodriguez complains about that on the commentary. This movie is Rated R so why can't they show that much gore? Paul Anderson (director) said that the movie had insufficient funds to possibly make gore and stuff. So that was lame. Also Michelle never got to use her knife, and it was because they didn't have enough time or money to show zombie guts getting taken out.
The Ending was terrible.... WHAT THE HECK HAPPENS! THATS SO ANNOYING YOU CAN'T JUST GET AWAY WITH THAT! The ending leaves you wondering if Matt turns into Nemesis cause that doctor says ""I want him in the Nemesis program"". And where is Jill Valentine? Where is Brad Vickers? I will give them credit on one condition.... IF THEY PUT JILL VALENTINE IN THERE! WHAT THE HECK WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE IN RESIDENT EVIL 3 THE CITY IS NUKED AT THE END! So how could Alice (milla jovoich) possibly get out of Raccoon City? Thats gonna be an outrage if they do not put something about Jill Valentine on there. Also they MUST have Nemesis! They must because he was part of the story!
Final Point: This movie is good but not great.... The story line isn't good enough.... But lemme tell you the commentary is great, one of the first I've been happy to hear. So good bye yalls and thanks for reading",3.0
"The game is way better and there are too many spoofs like the writing in the the beginning ""TODAY ALL YOU'RE DREAMS COME TRUE"" they were both different and that was noticeable to me. The speacial effects were great and so was the action and acting. The way they made the ending it means that there has to be a sequel and I hope that they make it a little better than the first. That is all...Good bye.",3.0
"Resident Evil will probably never win any awards for subtly, acting or writing but it does satisfy the urge to watch an interesting horror movie. The original game was really a knock off of the concept from a number of previous movies (Night of the Living Dead, Warning Sign among many others). It's lack of originality is more than made up for with an imaginative production design and nicely paced narrative.
The plot is as simple as the game. There's dangerous research going on in the Hive. Someone has stolen a lethal virus that turns whomever it kills into flesh eating zombies. A crew is sent in to discover what's happened to the Hive when the computer shuts it down killing the infected staff of 500 workers.
It's clear that Paul Anderson's film owes a huge debt to Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. While George Romero chose to inject an element of savage satire into his trio of films, Anderson plays his film as a straight ahead thriller. There's lots of close ups of gruesome things. The most clever and original element in this film is making the persona of the central computer into a little girl.
This isn't anything heartwarming or original about Resident Evil but it's a fun thrill ride for fans of the original game. It's a pity that Anderson chose not to add any additional subtext to the film as it would have given him and his performers more to work with given the thin narrative. This superbit edition has improved resolution (particularly noticable on a progressive DVD player and HDTV) when compared to the previous, regular editon. Is it worth buying again and paying more money for? Frankly, given the film itself probably not. It's not a surprise to see this film released in the superbit format (vs. more deserving films)as Hollywood has learning to fleece customers many times for ""new improved"" product.",3.0
"For such a historical figure, I expected a bit more coming into the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie simply because of the story, the action, and the time-period.  Unfortunately, however, Joan of Arc - the catalyst for legendary events in French history, the end of a war, and the first person anyone thinks of when there is even the slightest mentioning of burning at the stake - really deserves more.

First, the positive aspects of this movie probably outweigh the bad.  The scenery, style, and medieval genre is represented well.  The film has a very powerful feel, and properly displays how thoughts, beliefs, and energy can be controlled and swayed by the power of religion.  Such greatness has been accomplished through religion, but this film also shows the gritty realism of widespread death that has been brought about from religious intolerance.

The bad, however, is two-fold: acting and influence.

Joan of Arc was probably not a hyperventilating, over-reacting, deranged, incompetent military leader.  If I were French I would hate this movie.  It basically paints Joan of Arc as a vindictive, revenge-driven, screaming harpy.  The fact that Milla Jovavich seems to have read an ""Acting for Dummies"" book written by Jim Carey - where facial contortions and eyeball bulging trump conveyance of emotion through acting - definitely didn't help either.

Whereas Joan of Arc was tried for heresy, to me the people who made this movie should be charged with something similar.  There is nearly no mention of Joan's military prowess, her benevolence, or her true religious devotion.  The fact that there is almost an insinuation that she was speaking to the devil, rather than Jesus, is almost blasphemous.

There's also the character I like to call ""Creepy Jesus"".  It's almost as if everyone involved really wanted to show religion as an ugly part of humanity, the possibility of visions being realistic or divine, or that there is inherent value in religion.  There could not have been a weirder actor chosen for the character of Jesus, and there surely couldn't have been a more negative portrayal of religion.

The Messenger covers most of the historical details decent enough, entertains the audience quite well, but it's just painfully obvious that the director was interested in psychoanalysis of Joan, her actions, her visions, and religion in general.",3.0
"This is not the best film by Besson. In fact it is in many ways incredibly naive and superficial, even in its desire to look and sound profound. Profundity is not only political gibberish diplomatic slang. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the French king to be and then king to opportunism. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of bishop Cochon to servile non-commitment. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the English to vengeful cruelty. It is also very superficial to reduce simple people to blind believers of anything that sounds iffy, godlike and slightly insane, like a girl leading an army or hearing and listening to divine voices. But all that must please many simple minds indeed. It is a shame because the subject deserves a serious film, a serious approach. Shakespeare forgot to write this play. He could have written a masterpiece on the subject. Besson just writes an average action film, some kind of medieval peplum film.

"This movie is quite long and most parts are very good, but the ending left me with a bad feeling because we were made to believe that Joan questioned her very faith and purpose. In my opinion, I don't believe in that. I don't think she ended up being psychotic. I didn't get the feeling of a hero. I have read reviews and documents about her and she seemed to be very confident, so I am not sure if she was portrayed correctly in the end. I would have liked the director to portray her as the hero she was. It's ok to leave the audience with the question, was she a hero or not, and it's ok to let her question herself in the film, but she should've believed in the purpose of God in the end. That's a true hero and saint. I guess it's all about what you believe and I think that she died knowing that GOD actually used her, but I know that most people would be afraid to die because of your belief. I am just sorry she had to be burned at a such a young age. How sad and frieghtening. If you haven't seen the movie yet, judge for yourself, but I don't think this movie had a great ending. I don't like to be left with a bad feeling.",3.0
"If you are wondering about Luc Besson's vaguely heretical ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"", try to imagine a cross between ""Excalibur"" and ""Heaven's Gate"". It looks great but the basic story gets lost in the histrionics and excess.

There really was a very religious young girl who was considered a savior to France during The Hundred Years War. Although things may have eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. Three years after her birth, the new tactics of the English archers were responsible for arguably the most one-sided battle in military history at Agincourt. The result was credited to Henry V's piety and he got a great passage in Shakespeare. The French aristocracy was almost wiped out by the battle and the English became solidly entrenched in France. Fourteen years later a new generation of French nobility was beginning to assert itself and it was the English and their French allies who were having leadership problems.

Both countries were Catholic at the time and both claimed that God was on their side, a bit like the football player who thanks God for the victory over another team that apparently God did not favor.

Although there are records of both of Joan's trials (her Condemnation Trial and her Rehabilitation Trial) both proceedings had their own political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. Besson's film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but takes obvious liberties with Joan's mental condition and visions. There is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as plausible as any other speculation.

What hurts ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" is that Besson's best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for the remainder of the film. Jane Valentine is wonderful as the young Joan and Besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was not confined to Natalie Portman's performance in ""Leon"". This early stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that you are likely to see in any film. IMHO it gets off to a better start than any film in cinema history.  And the sequence where the young Joan is standing on a hill watching as the English burn her village is as visually stunning as anything ever filmed.

But once Milla Jovovich's grown-up Joan takes over most viewers will find it difficult to stay focused on the story. It's not miscasting, Jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances (see ""The Dummy"") rather than subtlety and nuance, making her a good fit for the take Besson wanted on Joan's personality. The problem is that while a viewer could identify with the young Joan, the older Joan is just repellent. Her story should be inspirational and tragic. Instead it is a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama.

But it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning sequences.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",3.0
"I've tried, folks. In all sincerity, I have made more than three noble attempts at watching this film in its entirety. Each and every time, without fail, I fall fast asleep. It not only disappoints me that the historical facts have been skewed for no justifiable reason, but it's also tiresome to watch Milla Jovovich play Joan like a heroin junkie. Several inconsistencies abound throughout, from dialects to editing. I think I finally sold this one for some gas money. It only got me around the block.",3.0
"Fun flick, but one minor complaint...
I am not a huge fan of the Zombie genre, but enjoy them quite a bit.  I understand the ""rules"" and like watching a movie that works well within it's own particular idiom.  I can say the same about Romantic Comedies, Documentaries and Action Adventure flicks.  When they're done well I enjoy the heck out of them.
That having been said, Resident Evil compares favorably among it's fellows.  I'm not going to discuss plot because there are a few hundred reviews posted here on Amazon that explain pretty much everything.  Besides, you really don't want me to ruin it, do you?
There is more action than gore, but it's pretty graphic action so Argento freaks may not walk away happy but the rest of us will have a good time.  There is an Aliens type feel to the elite military team, but the characters are very broadly sketched and there's not a lot of feeling for them as they fall victim to the beasts and nasties that inhabit the lair beneath the mansion.  Still, seeing a few hundred zombies ganging up on five or six well trained commandoes makes up for the lack of characterization.
As far as the effects go, my only complaint is the CGI work on the most monstrous of the beasties.  The concept was excellent, but the execution left a bit to be desired.  Resident Evil is based on a computer game and the monster looked like he was lifted right off a Playstation and dropped onto the set.  I actually chuckled at one point when he was climbing up a wall and looking over his shoulder.  My finger automatically sought out a fire button to waste his sorry behind.
All that having been said I do have one major complaint about this flick.  Are we supposed to believe that these folks live in a world where there has not been a single zombie movie ever made?  Reanimated dead folks, shambling through corridors trying to eat human flesh and none of these crack commandoes have the presence of mind to try a head shot?  I know with small arms it's advisable to shoot for the center of the target, but how many rounds do you put into something's chest before you try another target?  It's a small complaint, I know, but just once I wish a character in one of these movies would have seen a Romero movie some time in their life.
Long and short of it; decent effects save one CGI character, a decent plot and wall to wall zombie killing action...  I can think of worse ways to spend a Saturday night.",3.0
"I think too many people are looking at this movie as a historical remake of Joan's life. That would be as unwise as expecting Braveheart to show the real William Wallace.

The reality of this is that you are viewing an opinion piece on the Joan mythos. What the writers and director are trying to achieve is not accuracy, but rather allegory.

As for an opinion on this work: It does not meet its potential until the third act, the trial. The questions raised in this a perfectly fit for a modern French audience. One can not, but laugh at the way Modern Christian Doctrines are lobbed at medieval problems. I think those who do not view this last part with some hint of satire are missing much of what this movie has to offer.

It is not the greatest film ever made, but don't let those who wanted it to be something else fool you... it is not an abomination of the Joan story.",3.0
"In reading of most reviews for this movie it is to majority consensus that Milla Jovovich portrayed Joan of Arc as if she were a raving lunatic, as if leading an army and a revolution were an easy task for a nineteen year old girl. Most reviews state that historical accuracy had been distorted, (granted the rape scene has no historical backing, and that King Charles was actually much younger than portrayed) but to imply that Joan of Arc had easily accomplished her god sent tasks would be not only a distortion of historical accuracy but also a discredit to all of her feats, it would be foolish to say that she hadn't been affected by the stress of war, not being a formal military leader and relying on her faith to bring her to victory.

  I found Dustin Hoffman's performance to be nothing short of accurate in the terms of Joan's conscience and possibly the devil himself. The movie's bleak ending seems in my opinion to be plausible, when considering that her Army believed in her and did not question that she had been sent messages from god. It was only after her capture by the English that in her dark cell she began to question herself. And who wouldn't? It was the first time she had been so scrutinized. Nobody ever went into war believing that he/she was in wrong doing, and after her capture while on trial (if you can call it that) she was being questioned and after blindly following her beliefs into battle she no longer has support. Who without any support wouldn't question themselves?",3.0
"I liked this movie it had very little gore tho but for a new horror movie it had lots. I know this was based on a video game but this could have worked has a prequel to night of the living dead if you think about it, cause the story in night for the living dead is radation has caused people to mutate in this one a virus has caused people to mutate this would work too as a prequel. Anyways about the movie i gave it three stars because there inst much gore involved but it is really fast paced and it never stops and you also have some neat monsters but again you see almost no one get ripped apart by these monsters.

"I thought this movie would be a little better than it was, but, oh well. Anyway, the worst part of the movie is the acting. Have you not seen acting this bad in your life? Also, the movie needs a little more Colin Salmon. He is about the only non-boring character in the movie. Another bad thing is the fact that the whole movie takes place in a weird underground facility. What happened to the glamourous mansion and dilapidated laboratory? The game doesn't take place in some shiny, futuristic complex. Another problem. I guess the good parts of the movie are action sequences when fighting the undead creatures. The zombies also look good, but sometimes the creatures look like unscary crap! Who likes that? Take a look at the version of the Licker and you'll see what I'm talking about. There are some very well done jump scenes, such as with the man being attacked by his sister. But others are deliberately there, trying to be suspenseful. Then, after you freak slightly, it turns out to be nothing at all! The movie was well-done, but too short, sometimes boring, and untrue to the game. Overall, if you like zombie movies or Resident Evil, you might wanna check this movie out. If you don't like zombies or RE, stay far, far away!",3.0
"This movie is EXTREMELY UNDERRATED. No, it's not a classic. No, it's not an academy award winner. But it does succeed where many others have failed.
First, the good things:
1) THE PACING, ACTION, AND SUSPSENSE are some of the best I've ever seen in a film. This film has a real sense of urgency and moves along at a breathtaking pace. It jumps from gloomy suspense to exciting action all within minutes. Both aspects are done very well; the movie will excite you with its visceral action scenes and scare you at the same time.
2) THE ACTING is well done. While much of the characters aren't explained through dialogue, their body movements and subtle gestures to each other make you learn much about the characters. Some of the acting is a bit sketchy, but it's good enough that it comes to the point where you care when some of the people die.
3) THE MUSIC AND PRODUCTION DESIGN: The sets are wonderful and completely convey the high-tech, computerized feel that the movie is about. The music also flows with the production design and the acting, so everything feels in-sync. And by the way, the music greatly helps the picture, whether its the booming base during the battle scenes are the subtle high notes during the suspensful ones.
4) THE PLOT IS GREAT. The director has the characters face so many enemies (alive, undead, machine, chemical, etc.) that the movie keeps surprising you and makes you keep guessing. It unfolds as a mystery and with the characters trying to pick up the pieces throughout.
And the bad things...
1) THE LENGTH was too short. At only 94 minutes (not including the credits), it didn't leave a lasting impression and I was forced to watch it again to get a better ""feel"" for it. There could've been much more character development and some of the sets created great places for some outstanding action scenes. Unfortunately, they are not to be seen.
2) THE SPECIAL EFFECTS could've been better. Seeing the Licker push its way out of the metal cage always looks fake to me. But, they had a low budget so the Director did the best he could.
3) THE ENDING, although good, should've been replaced with the alternate one. According to web interviews with director Paul W.S. Anderson and the commentary, there was a huge, action-packed ending with Milla Jovovich using the same gun that the ""One"" character had. A chance for more much-needed action. The ending presently in the movie is good and leaves room for a sequel, but I think there was enough scary stuff in the movie and it needed more action. Also, the ""climatic"" battle with the Licker on the train was sort of a disappoinment.
All in all, a solid video-game to movie adaption. It still has many problems, but you can do MUCH worse that sit through and enjoy this. Trust me.  3.5 stars.

"I did not particularly like the action, and I found the whole movie a bit gloomy, lacking some lustre, some glamour (even though the close-ups on the pupils of Mila Jovovich are interesting). This is partly due to the origin of the movie (a video-game). Apart from that, the story itself is original and interesting (the T-Virus, the Hive, etc.) and there is some suspense. This is probably not the best movie of Mila Jovovich.",3.0
"Yes, Jovovich is a great actress. Yes, the battle scences give a good impression of what war was like back then. But the story is LOOSELY based on Joan of Arc's true story, and the truth here is better than fiction. So many errors and additions to the true story, that the title should be renamed. This is not the story of Joan of Arc. I would rate it higher if it did not pretend to be the story of Joan of Arc, as Jovovich really does some powerful acting, even if the script was wrong, and the battle scenes will leave a lasting impression on your mind. But I was so disappointed otherwise. The version with Leelee Sobieski captured the story better, much better; it stilled conveyed the question whether Joan was dillusional or actually was a messenger of God without having to badly distort the real story. Leelee Sobieski, another great actress, was a much more believeable Joan of Arc. Jovovich played another character -- she played that other character well, but it wasn't Joan of Arc.",3.0

"Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc is at times brilliant and at other times chaotic. In a few scenes it is brilliant and chaotic at the same time. How can this be, you ask? It's because it was made by the brilliant but messy French director, Luc Besson. Besson did two of my favorite pop culture movies, La femme Nikita and The Fifth Element. I admired both of these for the same reasons. Both are high-tech, fast-paced visualizations of absurd stories. They are triumphs of style over substance. Nikita is about a young female criminal who is coerced by the French equivalent of the CIA into becoming an assassin. The Fifth Element is a bizarre science fiction story set in the future. In it, Bruce Willis, aided by a truly weird alien girl, must keep the evilest force in the universe from destroying the human race. I think the reason that Messenger is a weaker film is that Besson's unique style does not work well when he deals with a story set six hundred years in the past.
You would think that this filming of the Joan of Arc story would be great because this is a French film with several American stars in the cast. [Don't panic! It's in English.] But, beyond Besson's limitations are the limitations of the story itself, which is shrouded in mystery. In the early 15th Century, a young French peasant girl named Joan had visions that she claimed told her she was to lead an Army that would free her people from English rule. The army was raised by the dauphin, the English retreated, and the dauphin became Charles VII, King of France. Afterwards, Joan's reward was to be tried as a heretic and then burned at the stake. This much seems to be accepted by historians. Whether or not Joan actually lead the army is hotly debated. Who actually tried Joan is also not known for sure. Some think it was the English, others think it was the Catholic church. We do not even know the exact nature of the charges against her. We cannot say for sure what events caused the poor girl to go from heroine to martyr. She was basically forgotten about until the 19th Century, when her story was used as a political tool to advance the cause of French nationalism. Five hundred years after her death, the Church declared her to be a Saint.
I tell you all this history because it is my opinion that a satisfactory movie about her will never be made, because it is impossible to tell the story in a way that will please everyone. That leaves us to deal with the successes and failures of The Messenger on a purely cinematic basis. Its strong points include its visual richness. The feel of the period is lovingly rendered. The script adroitly sidesteps the issue of Joan's visions. While it does not deny that her messages may have come from God, it also suggests the possibility that she was simply delusional. It concludes that, whatever the source of her messages, the savageness of her trial made even her doubt her sources.
One of the movie's weaknesses lays in casting Milla Jovovich as Joan. I have admired her work in other films, but, like the director, she is not the right choice for a historical epic. The biggest mistake, however, was made in choosing to show in detail several gruesome battles. These occupy perhaps a third of the movie's two and one half hours running time. They become redundant and detract from the more interesting story of Joan - her childhood, her visions, her dealing with royal powers, her interactions with the all-male troops, and her eventual and tragic fall from grace. The result is that Messenger is an interesting movie, but hardly a great one.",3.0
"That was the dilemma for those who were dealing with the real-life Joan of Arc, and it remains so in reel life in ""The Messenger"".
I had got some free passes for this movie; my friend John was glad to come with me and my sister because he knew something about it. I guess what he knew was that IT WOULD BE VIOLENT, which is often a powerful motivator for menfolk. Well, okay, so it was violent--what of it? I think the essential value of this movie is that after you see it, you have a fairly accurate idea of how medieval warfare was conducted, how men had to rev themselves up for terrifying hand-to-hand combat with a truly mortal enemy. This is not a women's picture, no.
Some things annoyed me about this picture. In the early pillaging scene, we see Joan is a little preteen girl. I thought, hey that's great, for once Joan is going to be a GIRL, you know, not a woman. But then we cut to the Dauphin/John Malkovich's castle where everyone's talking about the imminent visit from this strange visionary. She arrives, throws back her hood, and .... she's some other actress now! I really hate that kind of thing. This is a crucial scene; I have to trust my protagonist, and I don't even know this dame! She was also doing a lot of weird, border-line things that made you question her sanity. I don't think the real Joan comported herself like that--no one would have followed her into battle otherwise.
Another problem was that a famous part of the Joan story is that she hears three saints' voices talking to her; they're the ones who inspire her to fight against England's invasion. But this Joan meets up with Christ himself, and later, with Dustin Hoffman.

"Resident Evil is pap, stupid, predictable, violent, idiotic mayhem ... and I loved every minute of it.
I bought this DVD on a whim, and next to ""We Were Soldiers"" it was my favorite film of 2002. I laughed, shouted out advice or predictions, had a few suprises, and am maybe in love with Mila Jovovich. She looks simply fantastic, all wetted down in that little dress with her leather boots and kicking zombie butt.
2002 had two revivals of creature feature mayhem at it's best; ""Eight Legged Freaks"" with it's Giant Mutant Spiders On The Loose theme and the adorable Scarlet Johanson, and ""Resident Evil"" resurrecting the Zombie Movie for the Internet generation. Every possible Zombie Movie convention or style is shamelessly ripped off or recycled, with doses of ""Aliens"", ""The Andromeda Strain"" and even ""The Matrix"" thrown in for good measure. The film even boasts repeated, close-up views of Digital Readouts [of varying colors] ticking down until the film's implied doomsday. I am a connesiour [sp?] of Digital Readout movies, and ""Resident Evil"" has the best Digital Readouts I have seen since ""The Six Million Dollar Man"". If you want to watch a movie where you are constantly reminded of how long the plot has until doomsday, this is the movie for you.
It is also a movie that helpfully reminds its viewers of exactly what is going on every ten minutes or so by having a character list the plot details up to that point. This is done for the benefit of viewers who may have calculated that a run for the restroom is about due during the theatrical runs, and helps jar the memory of those who may not have been paying attention to every minute of the DVD. I found that helpful, because the people I watched it with and I were constantly discussing what was going on to the point where we were talking about the movie more than watching it. ""Resident Evil"" is an interactive film, and requires a sense of humor in addition to a strong stomach.
I am sorry that I missed seeing this movie in a theater; two of my fondest cinema visits were the aforementioned ""Eight Legged Freaks"", where each and every one of the audience members were interacting with each other and the movie. And ""Starship Troopers"", which I saw in NYC with an audience that, like me, were besides themselves with hilarity during the entire running length. ""Resident Evil"" is very much a film in the same genre, and as such delivered the goods, and is certainly due for some sort of ""cult"" status as time goes on. It is truly Something Awful.
But you know what? I'd rather have fun watching a movie than be subjected to an additional three hour purgatory like the two films that will probably contend for Best Movie this year [Peter Jackson's seriously bloated ""The Two Towers"" and Martin Scorcese's overtly ponderous ""Gangs of New York""]. They are fine movies to be sure, but it is refreshing to find a film that takes the gas out of the art form, and does it with a wetted down leather booted Mila Jovovich to boot.",3.0
"I wasn't sure what to expect when ""Resident Evil"" fired up, so my pre-conceived notions were minimal.  I've never played the game, and thus have no bias from that viewpoint.  To summarize the movie:  Another movie where a lot of people die and then come back to life, running around and attempting to eat everyone in sight.  How many times have we seen this plot?
Even though the plot is a retread that we've seen more times than we can count, there are a few nifty differences.  I loved the underground train.  I know.  What is the difference between the underground train and any subway?  In this case, it's the fact that it is under a house, leading to a top secret facility.  Furthermore, the train plays an important part in the end of the movie that has some top-notch special effects.  Some of the best special effects in the movie, in fact.
The hive was an interesting concept that the director spent just enough time on to provide a background for the plot, without spending so much time on it that you felt like it was time to go make popcorn.  I also liked the concept that Milla Jovovich and her male partner lost their memory and regained it throughout the movie.  However, the transition from memory loss to memory gain felt a bit jerky, and wasn't covered well by the pseudo-cool flashback sequences that weren't all that well done.  The best special effect was a super cutting laser effect that plays in a couple of deaths.
After these cool things, the movie is basically a bunch of people running around in zombie makeup trying to kill and eat the people still living.  There were places where the director tried to infuse a modern look into the movie by the way certain shots were set up and by laying a metal rock sound track to make everything seem more impressive than it really was.  Lastly was a heavy coating of blood on everything, as though that is sufficient to cover the spots where the creativity weakened.
I am glad I watched the movie, which will likely be the only time I ever watch it.  Not a terrible movie, but not terribly good either.  If you are relatively new to the zombie genre, you might find this movie interesting.  If you've seen very many of this movie's predecessors, such as ""The Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", and the numerous imitators, then this movie will be same old, same old.  Unless you are a hard-core Resident Evil video game fan, or just love a gore-fest no matter how thin the plot behind it, then perhaps this is the movie for you.  All others, rent first, buy later.",3.0
"I assume the dvd that ... is selling is the same one available in rental stores.  If it is I must say the movie is extremely difficult to hear.  Most of the time the dialogue is extremely quiet or not even evident.  If there is dialogue present then the soundtrack is recorded so strongly and loudly over it that you don't hear it.  Plus, if you have a dvd player with dynamic sound which evens things out you will NEVER hear the dialogue unless you turn it off due to the poor overpowering imposition of the soundtrack over the dialogue.  The neurotic bit with Joan grows tiresome  as well.  It is very nice though in it's way of gloriously demonstrating midevil warfare :)))",3.0
"Because the critics universally panned The Messenger, I had very low expectations for it. I was surprised that I found it interesting.  Bresson's direction and pacing are not sure enough for this to be a quality film, but his story of a conflicted, manic Joan nevertheless has appeal. I have often wondered how Saints were in real life. Bresson's Joan is both self-confident and self-effacing.  Her self-confidence wins her fame, but it is her honest examination of conscience, her total self-effacement that ultimately makes her a Saint. Joan loves God passionately; her spirituality is real. She eschews amulets as a false and facile form of spirituality.  But she is still fallen in her humanity (as all saints are) and her motives to serve God are perhaps tinged with pride and, possibly, a desire for revenge. Joan's hunger to 'be confessed' is a touching recognition of her sinfulness. 'The Messenger' is a flawed film but not without merit.",3.0
"After seeing the Messenger only a week after Hallmark's Joan of Arc, I think it's a testimony to the real life enigma that she could be interpreted in such very different ways- from a girl of incredible strength and courage ready to die for her faith to a woman made neurotic by circumstance and visions fueled by her faith in God despite all she had seen.  Leelee vs. Milla?  I think both women simply found a part of Joan they identified with and ran with it, though I must say, I enjoyed Leelee's portrayal more.  It was hard to watch the end though with the conscience (Dustin Hoffman) but when you are called by God to do something it often doesn't make sense- even to you and you are tormented with whether it is really God or your ego.  And yet, you must keep these fears silent to accomplish the goal.  In that, I think ""Messenger"" hits both its mark and the heart of Joan of Arc in this beautifully sylistic if gritty epic.",3.0

"""Resident Evil"" is yet another in a very long line of video-game movies. It ranks somewhere in between ""Street Fighter"" and ""Super Mario Brothers."" The plot is this: an underground office known as the hive is infected with a strange virus and all the people as well as a few dogs turn into zombies. Yes, it's as pathetic as it sounds, but there's some pretty good action. For the most part, though, the film fails to generate the intense frights that the video games have. The zombies really aren't that terrifying, but the special effects and makeup are very well done. As for the story, it's only mildly interesting and very obviously incomplete.

"If it were not based on a true story, Luc Besson's `The Messenger: The  Story of Joan of Arc' would be a tale filled with credibility gaps a mile  wide. Since it is, however, a recounting of one of the world's most famous  stories of military triumph and personal tragedy, the film actually  generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those  mind-boggling historical incredibilities.
Joan was, of course, the  deeply devout, illiterate peasant girl who, spurred on by what she claimed  were visions and voices sent directly by God - assuring her and France of a  glorious victory over the advancing forces of the invading English army -  managed to convince a desperate monarch to have her lead an army into the  field, despite the fact that she brought with her no previous battle  experience or even a rudimentary knowledge of the use of weapons in combat.  We first see her as a young girl, strangely obsessed with religious piety,  attending confession daily, running through the woods in a mad frenzy of  ecstasy, encountering strange, inexplicable visions along the way, and,  eventually, being driven to an intense hatred of the British by the rape  and murder of her beloved older sister. We see the French royalty, so  driven to desperation by the seemingly inexorable encroachment of the  brutal British onto their native soil, that they lend credence to this  child and give in to her demands, sending her out to lead the troops into  what turns out to be some truly miraculous routs and victories. But glory  is, more often than not, an ineffable entity that is lost as quickly as it  is gained - and Joan learns tragically that, once her original goal of  restoring the French monarch to his throne is achieved, her services are no  longer of value, and she is allowed to be captured by the English, tried by  the Catholic Church, and burned at the stake by the English government for  the crime of witchcraft.
Given this fascinating and astonishing series  of events, it would be difficult to make a film completely lacking in  interest and insight. And, indeed, `The Messenger' is, perhaps, a better  film than many of the harsh, almost bitter reviews by many critics would  indicate. The first half of the film is a rather conventional telling of  the tale. The warrior Joan often comes across as a shrill, petulant  adolescent who somehow never convinces us that she is, indeed, someone all  these military strategists would follow. But, about midway through the  film, the screenwriters, Andrew Birkin and writer/director Besson, begin to  apply some psychological depth to the character. After a particularly  sanguine encounter with the English, in which hundreds of decapitated and  limbless corpses strew the blood-soaked ground, Joan breaks down in despair  over the horrifying inhumanity of the sight. From then on, her actions  arise from a paradoxical conflict occurring within the very core of her  being - between the righteousness of her pious cause, the pacifistic  teachings of Christ and her single-minded devotion to her king and country.  When she is finally captured and held in prison before and during her  trial, she begins to question the veracity of her visions and to ponder  whether the motivation for her cause really lay in divine inspiration or an  obsession for personal glory and power. We're a long way from the astute  psychological insights of Carl Dreyer's classic silent film version of the  story, `The Passion of Jeanne d'Arc,' but `The Messenger' does take  occasional time out from its action sequences to attempt to explore the  question of whether Joan's miracles were the product of divine intervention  or of mere happenstance and chance coupled with a determination and passion  borne of insanity. Unfortunately, casting Dustin Hoffman as the Voice of  Conscience who visits her in her cell and speaks for the side of reason as  she descends more and more into seeming madness, renders much of this  otherwise fascinating section faintly ludicrous. Every time his overly  familiar face and voice arrive on the scene, we are immediately thrust out  of the context of the story and find ourselves tempted to giggle out loud -  hardly the tone one wants to establish as Joan of Arc marches grimly to the  stake. Also, much of what he utters rings false in the context of the  film's era; he sounds like he is mouthing psychobabble that would not  arrive on the scene for at least another five hundred years.
In terms of  dialogue, historical films have always it seems had to face an inevitable  Hobson's Choice: should the writers employ language that reflects the  reality of the time, thereby making the characters sound stilted or dated  by today's standards, or should the authors resort to the use of more  modern vernacular, enhancing the immediacy of the story, perhaps, but also  possibly creating an uncomfortable and awkward sense of anachronism that  weakens the verisimilitude of the film so painstakingly established by the  elaborate set decoration and costume design of the film? The writers of  `The Messenger' have, for the most part, taken the latter course, leading  to mood-shattering declarations by the characters such as `she's nuts!' and  `I'm gonna kill that f------ bitch' along with a barrage of four-letter  word expletives with which no contemporary PG-13 or R-rated feature could  ever do without.
Those with a queasiness when it comes to movie violence  had best be forewarned: the battle scenes, though expertly shot and edited,  register high on the bloodletting scale.
Of the performers, none matches  in quality the exquisite photography, art direction or costume design that  adorn the film. Milla Jovovich is, at best, adequate as Joan, rarely giving  more than a surface interpretation of the complex psychological struggles  occurring at the root of her personality. John Malkovich, as the would-be  French king, for whose throne Joan lays her life on the line, has his  moments, but the part is not really big enough in the context of the film  to allow him to create a multifaceted performance. Faye Dunaway brings a  cool, subtle intensity to her role as the future king's manipulative  mother-in-law.
`The Messenger' emerges as an ultimately unsatisfying  mixture of faults and virtues, yet, because it has such a fascinating story  to tell, the film is far more interesting than the brutally hostile reviews  that greeted the work's initial release would lead one to believe.",3.0
"It is hard to say if this is a good movie or not. What confuses the issue is that it purports to be the story of Joan of Arc, which it is not. So I  ask myself, is it a good movie if we change all the names?. And I would  have to say, yes, it's a good story. Implausible perhaps, but gripping,  scary, weird, dramatic: a psychological study of frenzied revenge ending in  insight, repentance and inner peace. But as a dramatization of the life of  Joan of Arc it is a flop, an ""F"", a Zero. The Milla Jovovich  character is as far from the winsome, simple, and tenderhearted peasant  girl as the East is from the West. For those of you who want to learn about  the real Joan, there is a wealth of information including extensive first  hand accounts from the Trial of Nullification. It is well worth the effort.  Joan's life is one of the most incredible in all history, very moving and  thought provoking.",3.0
"While reviewing this video, I have wondered about whether Joan of Arc was portrayed accurately from a historical standpoint.
The writer depicts Joan as somewhat of an mentally off balanced or insane eccentric who has  weird visions. Realizing that Joan was declared a saint some 500 years  later, the writer attempts to protray her as material for sainthood with  Joan obsessed with confession to a priest for her sins and belief in  transubstantiation as the means of empowering her for her tasks.
The  Roman Church with its Inquisition that tried Joan is pictured in a much  favorite light. The English get most of the blame in the end, as the church  Inquisitors try to exonerate her but in the end declaring her to be a  martyr for the English.
In comparison, the video Joan of Arc played by  Leelee Sobieski has a much better and believable plot than this one. Milla  Jovovich has a much harder role in this script. She does a good job as does  her suppporting actors.",3.0
"""The Messenger"" is a compulsively watchable and notable film, not only for its visual lavishness, but also for its approach: it takes a shop-worn period tale, and delivers it in a much more contemporary and  modern pace.  Instead of just saying, ""This is a movie about a girl  named Joan of Arc"",  it gives us interesting insight on the power of  the conscience, psychology, and religion.  Milla Jovovich is pretty good as  the lead character, always boisterous and impulsive, but at the same time  understandable.  While the dialogue was a little drab (the audience is  always one step ahead--we know what the characters are going to say), and  the movie drags a little, it is more than made up for by the sheer epic  feeling you feel when the camera takes you in the heat of those battles.  The scenes where Joan is in interal conflict are disturbing and wrenching.  Mostly, though, it's plain fun and entertainment.",3.0

"I've played every Resident Evil game and book there is and I have to say what the heck is this movie about?  I mean if you're going to call it Resident Evil you might want it to look and be as close to the game as you can.  When I heard the movie was coming out I couldn't wait to see it...but now that I have I wished I didn't.  The script was terrible; it took away from the whole resident evil series.  Originally the whole plot was Umbrella Corporation was creating genetically engineered B.O.W. Weapons.
From the start things were terribly wrong.  The mansion (if you could call it that) wasn't even what it looked like in any of the games and the hive what the hell was that???  Both the mansion and Raccoon City had its own underground labs. And the Red Queen what the hell where they thinking?  That took away from what could be expected to be a great screen play of the popular Resident Evil games.  R.E. gamers expect if you have zombies and the other nasty creations where is the scientists who created them?  The scientist in the movie look like college graduates rather than medical geniuses who would research on something like the T-Virus.
There was no mention of S.T.A.R.S. the G-Virus or even William Birkin, who was the man who created the T-Virus. That would have made this movie more worth while to see. It would also have cleared a lot of things up and made the movie sell more.  The zombies both portrayed what they did in the game because they weren't all messed up because they don't decay fast.  I thought that the licker and the zombie dogs were also a really good touch.  But the movie would have been better if there were a little bit more monsters like hunters, zombie crows, and the infamous Tyrant.  They would have made this a better movie.
The acting was good considering the bad script.  Actresses Milla Jovovich (Alice) and Michelle Rodriguez (Rain Ocamo) did really well.  The scripting and design on the laser room scene was bad.  The whole team could have just stayed but the front or back doors where the laser beam couldn't hit them (because the glass wall didn't extend to the doors) would have been a smart move. But instead you have 3 butchered commandos and one diced leader.
In all, this movie to Resident Evil gamers is a partial upset.  And its replay life is only a couple of times.  But for all you suspense/horror movies this one is your movie.  It contains many thrilling parts including zombie carnage, action packed gun battles, navigating through a dark murky sewer, and a high speed train slug match between the living and undead.  This is an especially good zombie movie even though it isn't as gory as some but the suspense is what makes it a good movie.
Although this movie had a lot of changes and upsets it is still a good movie.  The movie also left off at a good spot where the other one could pick up on.",3.0
"The first time around, the movie was good. The second time, the movie was still good, but the flaws were very noticable. The utmost of those flaws directly involves Anderson and Milla. He is too busy attempting to steal every Hitchcock trick in the book, while Milla walks around looking pretty but acting very vapid. She shows off her wonderful body a few times, so I don't fault her for not doing much.

The DVD quality is spectacular. The picture is amongst the best of any DVD--and the DD 5.1 sound is better than it was in theaters. Unfortunately that spectacularity does not extend to the special features. No, what you get is: some lame trailers; some even lamer behind the scenes footage (Milla is fine as hell, so just be sure to use the pause button frequently); and you get the worst commentary in years.

The commentary of doom!

It is packed with people: Director Anderson, Producer Bolt, Actresses Milla and Michelle. But the problem here is Milla, only Milla. Apparently she never learned what a commentary is, and is shocked when it is explained to her (""you mean we talk for the whole movie?""). Anderson and Bolt make numerous attempts to describe the set-up to a shot, or any number of other technical matters, but Milla won't have it. All she does is joke around, really bad jokes, and interrupt anyone who talks. She makes fun of the movie, bashes her male co-star repeatedly for something SHE did, and generally acts a fool. It is really sad. She may not be the best actress, but most people assumed she was intelligent: European woman, speaks multiple languages... But she plainly shows us the woman underneath the beauty. Milla is a moron. Too bad.

"I thought that Resident evil could have been a bit better for example they could have introduced the characters a bit more.
I thought that the girl in the red dress was Gill from the origional. Also the mansion did not come in to the film enough seeing as the origional was based on a mansion over ran with flesh eating zombies and other mutated creatures.
I would not mind seeing it again but i now have to wait until christmas or just after for it to come out on VHS",3.0
"This is what is worthwhile watching in this movie. Nothing more. THe  battle sequences are amazing; it's funny to see all the British with rotten  teeth and the French with white clear and white teeth !! Mila did not a  good job, repeat, did not a god job as Joan. She overacted with no purpose  at all. Dustin Hofffmann, as her conscience, is fantastic, although in a  very small role.",3.0
"The story of Joan of Arc as portrayed in ""The Messenger"" is highly uplifting and deeply moving despite some of the most akward scenes, and the many errors with the story.  The way that Milla potrayed Joan  was on my account moving to the point where it has pushed me in new heights  with my beliefs about God and how I react on a whole. She showed a Joan of  Arc that was a teen, a loyal follower of God, and a fighter till the end.  She poytrayed a Joan that in my opinion is a role model in the fact that  she practiced what she preached, followed her heart and faith until the  very end of her life.  The only part of the movie I really didn't like  was the rape scene really made me sick. The fact that they put that in  there and it didn't really happen was kinda disturbing. The movie in a  whole is good, and is definatly rentworthy or a good purchase.",3.0
"Torn. Yes, this is how I was left feeling when the move came to a close. Let me explain:
  I was filled with much anticipation & excitement hearing of
this action-packed/sci-fi starring two female roles: Milla Jovovich & my new found favorite, Michelle Rodriguez(Girlfight). I have followed Milla's early modeling career back when she graced the covers of Nov & Dec '89 issues of Seventeen Mag up until her movie career. She has played a variety of charectors far from her 'model persona'. But to put her in a flimsy red dress & black leather boots to fight off something capable of destroying mankind? It strays away from her role as Alice, a strong member of a covert security team which she specializes in
hand-to-hand combat, not to mention martial arts skills assured to leave any 'livingdead' DEAD. I'm sure they thought a slight peep of her thighs would keep our attention. What they don't realise it's those rediculous decisions that make a film flop. Milla took what she was given & did the best she could: to [beat down]& look cute.
  Then there's Michelle Rodriguez. She rightfully is dressed the part of a commando. 1st class to be exact. No frills and she does not need any. She has a certain mystique and charisma that no lipstick or fancy wardrobe could come close to.
  Although I believe the script was poorly written and we, the audience, were not fully introduced to the charectors as individuals, I truly feel the actors put all they could in this film.
  Oh yeah, it scared the hell outta me, and the soundtrack was great. The fight scenes left me at the edge of my seat.
Maybe someday we can have it all in an action or sci-fi: great writing, well rounded plot, interesting charectors, & most of all, leading ladies getting the job done and takin' names later.",3.0
"but, not terribly scary... I guess I was hoping for this to be a real terror-inducing ride, and although it certainly has it's unsettling moments, I never really found myself checking the corners for zombies afterward. However, what it lacks in chills, it more than makes up for in pure, stylish violence. Milla Jovovich jump-kicking the rotting hounds is a standout scene, and there are plenty of those slow-mo bullet shots (ala The Matrix) that directors seem to dig so much these days.
But, in the end, the film left me longing for more scary. It seems that the director abondoned the elements that make the game such a terrifying thrill, replacing them with sleek sci-fi action. Not that that's a bad thing really but.. let's just say it would have been a lot creepier had it been modelled a bit closer to it's interactive counterpart.",3.0
"I'm not even a big fan of this genre of video game -- or of gorefest flicks -- but a friend convinced me to watch it. The special effects were good overall, and there was plenty of beefcake (especially the now-hunky Eric Mabius) which made it worth watching.
Overall worth a rental , maybe even a purchase for a repeat guilty pleasure.",3.0
"This movie had excellent sets and costume design. The acting is good, the character build up was good for some characters. The fight scenes were almost as good as Braveheart. The script was very modern, with phrases like  booty. The film dragged a little at some points and could have used some  more trimming. The ending was kind of empty in its simplicity. A lot of the  story is based on assumption, so don't expect a history lesson. Worth  renting but I personally wouldn't buy it.",3.0
"Luc Besson looks now as a man with the Midas touch  surprised for the first time in his life by the result. The thing he'd touched did not turn to gold but to something less valuable - something more like copper.
I  was stunned by Nikita - no one was expecting such a cool and modern action  movie from a French director. Professional was much more kitschy but still  enjoyable. The Fifth Element's visuals were so exciting no one really cared  about the content and just enjoyed the extravaganza.
Now it seems Luc  Besson was carried away and decided he can create a masterpiece just from a  scrap - from his girlfriend's photo to be exact(see the DVD's  leaflet).
He employs and directs the team of very skillful cameramen and  costume designers, gets the adequate funding - it's easy for the most  popular French director planning to tell the story of the most famous  French heroine - employs the most handsome French actors and invites some  Americans. Like an experienced pyrotechnic he puts together the fabulous  fireworks expecting them to burst in the sky in many-colored blaze.
What  we have instead? Psssshhhhhhhhhick.
Why?
Obviously Luc Besson has  nothing to say about Joan of Arc.  He had no coherent idea to express -  just action, design and music.
There are 3 definite parts in the film -  The Visions, The Battle, The Trial.
When he feels one more vision would  be one too much Luc Besson lets the battle begin. Battle scenes are a genre  in themselves, they can hold the viewer's attention with the gory action  and display of curious war machines, weaponry and armour. But after an hour  it all began to look too much. That is 101th time we are shown ""The  True Face Of War"" in recent years, all these crows pecking dead flesh  and oozing bloody limbs lying all over are something we expect to see -  their's shocking potential is exhausted.
What's next ? The Trial. Nothing  memorable here. Dustin Hoffman contributed his name to the film's posters  and DVD covers. I am sure it helped to sell hundreds thousand of tickets  and copies extra, but the role is just ridiculous. Hoffman in gray beard  and hooded robe looks barely recognizable  - his best disguise since  Tootsie. In a sadistic monotone he is stubbing the girl with his stupid and  pretentious questions.
By the way - no doubt that was a fashion these  days but Faye's shaven forehead makes her look so much like RoboCop I could  not concentrate on her words - just enjoyed the unexpected  similarity.
But! I think that Milla is perfectly cast. Of course first of  all she is a model, but do we need a Meryl Streep for the role of young  peasant girl, the messenger, the medium? And the girl is so suitably  androginous yet sexy, great to look at  - since the film is obviously not  ""serious"" I'd prefer to see Milla in a leading role, not someone  with richer inner life but not-so-perfect body.
Besides, she is a fellow  Slav. Any French actress with Gallic calculated charm and sophistication  could not be credible in her fervour.
The dialogues are contemporary.  When I saw Joan stopping her adjutant on his way out of her chamber to ask  for a hairdresser I was struck by the realisation that Ms. Jovovich in her  The Ritz suite would communicate with a valet in exacctly the same  tone,with the same gesture.
Most of the reasoning and the concepts worded  are clearly does not belong to the Middle Ages.
Music is so predictable  you hear just what you expect to hear.
And the burning scene is so  abrupt! I did not plan to contemplate the death throes, but to finish the  160-minutes long film in the 2-minute haste...
Still I can not call the  movie a complete flop. There are some images - Milla with boyish face  and  man's haircut on her white horse, raising the banner,etc - that will stay  in public consciousness. And I was not bored watching the film.
Yes, it  could be much better, but still it's definitely worth seeing. I've even  bought the DVD - to continue my Luc Besson collection - but I hope the next  addition will be more rewarding.",3.0
"I missed this movie in the theatres, so I was excited about its video  release.  I watched the CBS movie about Joan of Arc and felt it left out  too many details.  The Messenger is the same way.  They did use some actual  events and some of the recorded dialogue that Joan used, but it seemed that  the director used alot of ""artistic license"" too.  The actors  used alot of modern language and phrases that I don't believe would be used  in the 1400s, and then out of nowhere Milla Jovovich would use an actual  Joan quote and it would seem out of place.  The visual affects were good  though and I think Dustin Hoffman was terrific in his role.  Overall, Milla  was convincing as a wild young woman on a mission.  I just wish the writers  would have dug a little deeper into the actual history of Joan.",3.0
"Sorry folks, but it was too long and drawn out. You need patience to sit through this movie, and the end was a bit of a let-down. Hoffman tried hard but hats off to the leading lady. Cut about 30 minutes off and this could  have been a classic...",3.0
"I've been fortunate enough to have visited Rouen, the city where Jeanne was held, put on trial, and ultimately put to death.  Many features of this film (costume, setting, etc) are very accurate.  The battle scenes were very good.  I have a problem with Milla's acting....it seems as if she  tries too hard.  Also what's with the Conscience...let the actor portray  that stuff!  Or is it that Milla couldn't do that?  'Screaming and crazy  screaming' were her two modes.....I'd agree.",3.0
"Resident Evil is yet another movie based on a video game and I must say I don't think it was that bad. Sure the Zombies are no where as scary as the ones in Romero's films, just seem more like people with rabies than the living dead, lol. What I was surprised about though was the acting, it wasn't all that bad. Think Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) gives her best performance yet, Michelle Rodriguez (The Fast & the Furious) is pretty good too. Getting rid of George Romero was the biggest mistake though as I was really looking forward to a come-bat. Mean the director of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead doing Resident Evil would of been a dream come true. Sure his scrpt that was canned was much better too.
  Well anyway despite that let down, besides the acting I also liked the action, especially the train sequence at the end. Think there's a little too much confusing in the very end though, leaves too many loose ends. For instance there's a certain character whose fate really isn't clear and who you don't see again, guess they're planning a sequel. As long as they have a better script, scarier zombies and the sexy  Milla Jovovich returns I'll have no problem with that.",3.0
"A sweeping epic film. I was impressed by the cinematography. I was fascinated by the psychological twists and questions the film raises. The battle scenes, I must say, are not for the fainthearted. This could have  been a great film. What ruined it for me was the performance by Jovovich. I  found it overdone and annoying. I was greatly disappointed.",3.0
"As a student of history, I loved this movie... It explored depths of Joan's character that most books don't explore.  It's amazing how many ""history"" books to this date still write about Joan of Arc in a  ""Christ-Like"" light, because she claims to have had divine  conversation with the almighty.  This is the first time I have seen anybody  delve into Joan's character as a possible schizo / mentally ill person --  and I love how she begins to figure out that she is a nut case as her world  comes crumbling down.  Of course, if you are a romantic and choose to  believe in the myth of Joan of Arc, then it leaves you enough tidbits to  keep carrying on that vision -- Dustin Hoffman is excellent as the Devil.",3.0
"Defintately a good attempt at a movie, with some staggering results, and some not so adequate ones.  Milla Jovovich does an ok job as Joan, nothing really moving.  The movie mostly concentrates on the battles and very  little on story.  I don't really know the story well, but what little there  was held a small bit of interest.  The battles scenes are done extremely  well, much reminding me of 'Braveheart'.  I love John Malkovich but he  didn't have much material to work with.  The key was Dustin Hoffman.  His  screen time in the two and half hour movie is at the most fifteen minutes,  and he totally steals every scene he is in.  The purpose of his character  is great, and he handles it so well.  All in all an enjoyable movie.",3.0
"Like the video game it's based on, Resident Evil delivers the shocks, scares, and screams we've come to expect from the game.  However, the movie doesn't offer quite an eerie atmosphere as we've come to expect from the game, but then again this isn't the game we're talking about.  Director Paul W.S. Anderson (who brought another video game series to the big screen with the original Mortal Kombat, as well as Event Horizon) directs with his usual flair and penchant for some bloody (but not very gorey, most of the gore is kept off screen) violence.  However, the film isn't scary at all, the only thing that is  scary is how gorgeous Milla Jovovich is.  You'll know pretty much when something is going to happen, and the special effects could have been more polished, I mean you can tell that the Licker is computer generated, it doesn't even look real at all.  However, the film does have some things going for it, the original storyline (as in not taken from the game but inspired by it) is a refreshment, and the score which handled by Marilyn Manson adds the movie.  All in all, Resident Evil is a mixed bag, but it is a lot better than a lot of the other garbage out today (XXX anyone?).",3.0
"Zombies and guns. Trapped. Zombies and guns. Running. Zombies and guns... It may sound like B-grade, popcorn, adolescent male fodder, but Resident Evil is actually a well-crafted movie of the survival-horror genre. Eschewing gore in favor of imagination, it skimps on the on-screen bloodbath, and instead plays a guessing game that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.
The scenario is that in the ultra secret military lab of the Umbrella Corporation, an extremely volatile virus has been set loose. The alarm is triggered, and the Red Queen, an artificial intelligence system, quarantines ""the hive"" to prevent the virus from reaching Raccoon City, trapping the workers in the process.
In an effort to save the survivors and salvage the research, a team of commandoes is sent in to reboot the Red Queen, before she seals the Hive permanently. A simple objective, but one immediately complicated by the discovery of our protagonist, Alice, a young woman suffering from amnesia. She has no memory, but the Team Lead recognizes her as an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, so she is taken into the hive with them.
What she finds there makes her doubt that she wants her memory back.
It may sound like overdone tripe, but Resident Evil (RE) takes some of the old horror cliches and makes them new again. Alice's memory loss is handled with intelligence, and enough mystery to keep the viewer guessing. The gore is minimal, as the film culls its scares from sound cues and implication rather than onscreen blood. Unlike so many other horror movies, it doesn't have gaping holes in it's plot (though there are a couple of lapses in continuity). Instead it cleverly weaves it's elements, slowly revealing how everything came to pass as it heads towards it climax. The coup de grace though, is the action. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez put the ""grrr!"" in ""girl."" Wallflowers won't survive in the Hive, and these two ladies are intent on living. When the ammo's gone, they resort to hand to hand combat, taking a chunk out of their adversaries.
I won't recommend RE to those who are faint of heart, or abhor lots of shooting, screaming, and scares. But for those that love a good action movie, pop a bag of popcorn, and make yourself comfy on the couch. You're in for a hell of a thrill ride. And when the movie's done, check out the special features. The 2-disc Collector's Edition coming later this year will have the lion's share, but the Special Edition is no slouch. There are several ""Making of"" featurettes, a music video by Slipnot, and a commentary track featuring the principal actors and the director. Definitely worth your dollar.",3.0
"Resident Evil is not a horror film. It is a zombie flick. And it is based on the intriguing idea behind a video game.
With this in mind, I rented the movie with my best friend. After hours of having sat behind my boyfriend in boredom while he played Resident Evil on Dreamcast, I wasn't expecting much. However, as several other reviewers have said, this was a welcome surprise.
Milla Jovovich is more than adequate as a heroine, and the plot thickens as is appropriate for an action flick. What works in the movie's favor is that it actually feels like a video game. There is atmosphere and pressure, thumping climactic music, zero character development, dialogue pared down to the essentials, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of locations, lots of zombies... all the comforts of Playstation, without having to move your thumb!
What genuinely moved me was the direction of this movie. The truly artful aspects of cinematography, sound, music, atmosphere, mist, slow pans... everything contributed to the sensory experience. Nice job. It's not Mozart, but it'll do. Break out the popcorn.",3.0
"First off I would like to address the idea that ""Resident Evil"" is a ""Pure Horror"" and not an action game. Have you people been living in the past. The game is based solely on action. The horror aspect was stuck in to give the genre a twist. Every Resident evil game was built around the shoot'em up concept. additionally, if anyone saw the previews before they decided to spend money on the movie would easily have known that this was a no-brainer, action flick. If you expected anything else then you shouldn't be writing reviews for anything.
 Needless to say, the movie was not the greatest movie ever made. It wasn't even close. But I can say it was fun to watch. I would like to see where they take the story to in the next movie, ""Resident Evil: Nemesis"" in the works now.",3.0
"Resident Evil is the kind of movie I like to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  Or any night of the week after 11pm when I'm too tired to think anymore.  It's like watching a really cool video game without all the work of actually playing it.
I loved this movie!  Based on the video game of the same name, it gives you all the zombie killing fun that I can only assume the game does (I've never played it but I've seen commercials for it on T.V.)
In the secret underground lab of the Umbrella Corporation, illegal genetic and chemical weapons experiments are being conducted.  One of the experimental agents is released in the facility and the A.I. enhanced super-computer that monitors the lab decides that the only way to contain the ""accident"" is to lock down the building and terminate the hundreds of researchers who have been exposed.  The company then sends in a special forces team to disable the computer and discover the reason for the disaster.  Once inside the team discovers that the A.I. is in control, the researchers have all become flesh eating zombies and  the genetic experiments have broken out of their cages.
Milla Jovovich, aka Leeloo from The Fifth Element, plays Alice, a special forces agent in a sexy evening gown with short term amnesia, who is found in the house above the lab complex and taken in with the team to secure the facility.  The only other actor of name is Michelle Rodriguez (Girl Fight, The Fast and the Furious) as one of the special forces soldiers.  Both women do a great job of running around blasting zombies and acting cool.
The special effects are really good.  The zombies are your basic slow moving, ever advancing, impossible to kill without a head shot variety.  The mutated killer dogs are scary and look real, but the CGI genetic mutants are disappointing.  Kinda like the stone warriors from the based on a video game movie Tomb Raider.  The 3-D computer maps of the facility that pop up periodically to show you where the characters are is a neat effect as well.
I was very pleased with this movie.  It was exactly what I expected it to be and the perfect waste of a Saturday afternoon.",3.0
"First off, I love the Resident Evil games.  I have played all of them (aside from Resident Evil Gaiden for the Gameboy Color, and Resident Evil Survivor which is just a title trying to cash-in on Sega's success with House of the Dead).  Having said that, I must warn fans to take this movie for what it is- an action movie with similar monsters and the same city.  The movie is loosely based on the game, there are no characters from the game, the mansion lab has been replaced by ""the Hive"" (a lab buried deep under Raccoon City, more in common with the 2nd and 3rd games).  So, once I turned off the RE fan boy inside and gave up on the hope that this would be a faithful representation of some of the finest games in the world, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience.  However some problems are inherent with the movie itself.  The villainous Red Queen seems to have conflicting motivations from scene to scene.  At times she seems to be merely enacting protocol, other times she seems to be playing a malevolent game with the lives of innocents.  The zombies, other than a couple instances, are uninspired.  Unlike the game where the people have had time to rot and are sufficiently dead-looking, these look merely like people that don't get out much.  The special effects are hard to believe, especially the Licker.  It doesn't look convincing, or even reasonably scary (a Hunter would have been a more suitable monster, if not several Hunters).  The fight seen between Milla and the Dogs is forgettable, and stupid.  Finally, the obligatory femme fatale SWAT team member, that takes no guff and shows no fear, is both contrived and offensive.  Otherwise, Resident Evil is an entertaining, if uninspired movie with more in common with Aliens than the game from which it recieves it's title.  I suggest you check it out.",3.0
"I wasn't expecting much when I began watching Resident Evil, so I was not so much disappointed with it. The plot is completely non-existent, the scenes just an excuse to lots of shots, punchs, kicks, etc. You know from the beginning who is the bad guy, how the end is going to be, all that. The low point of the movie is Michelle Rodriguez, from whose face we understand she's suffering severe pains in some kind of vital organ (in the real life, not in the movie). The high point is Milla Jovovich, more beautiful than ever. She is the only reason for someone to watch Resident Evil more than once. Milla is not hysteric like in ""Joan of Arc"", and not stupid like in ""The fifth element"". She is plainly gorgeous, and her almost-gone kind of voice is very atractive.
I give Resident Evil three stars: one for some of the action scenes, who were well done, and two for Milla, one for each of her lovely blue eyes.
Grade: 5.1/10",3.0
"Here's the problem. The filmmaker - one Paul Anderson - discards the whole survival horror premise in exchange for a straight action shoot-em-up film. The result - the fun of the game is lost. The film is at its best when the characters come up against hordes of zombies - including a really cool homage to both Day and Dawn of the dead involving intestines. But there is absoloutely no wit to the film - it wants to take itself too seriously. And that is the biggest problem. This film should have been fun, campy, and have absoloutely no regard for itself as a serious film. Instead, it tries to scare with the subtlety of a smack on the back of the head - and fails.",3.0
"Resident Evil, being one of my favorite video game franchise ever, intrigued me from the start and I was very excited to see the film when it opened. Now, while this is a very fun movie to watch, you can't help but notice the plot holes and imperfections that cause this movie to get only 3and a half stars from me. Again, don't get me wrong, I like the movie for what it is...action, action and more action. There is some great stylish violence in the film, some outstanding visual effects and make-up and decent acting from a reasonable cast. Milla Jovovich is very good in the film (although I must admit, I am kind of partial to her) and Michelle Rodrigues is another standout, However, the supporting cast was a little weak and I think they could have done a better job in that department.
The story of the film basically follows the game, but strays a little here and there. One of my favorite parts of the film is the ""red queen"" She is very interesting and well thought out. Overall, the movie is very entertaining and I enjoyed watching it, but I just can't bring myself to give it more than three and a half stars due to the plot holes and sub-par supporting cast.
The dvd is good. The menus look nice and the picture looks vivid and clear. The audio is also good. My only complaint is the extras, a little sub-par. The commentary track is nice, but there are no deleted scenes, outtakes or alternate scenes or endings. There are some featurettes, but they are a waste of time.
The movie gets 3 and a half stars. And the dvd presentation gets 3. A great movie to rent if you like action and one to own if you're zombified.",3.0
"As a fan of the Resident Evil games, I went to the film with the hopes of being scared out of my mind, sadly this did not happen.  Instead I was left sitting in the theater laughing at stuff that wasn't supposed to be laughed at.  Now upon purchasing the DVD and viewing the film a second and third time, I realize that the film isn't all that bad.  I wasn't really impressed with the audio commentaries by Paul Anderson, Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jeremy Bolt as they barely talked about the movie, but when they did talk about the movie it was insightful.  Some of the stuff they talk about in the commentary is entertaining and sometimes funny, but hardly worth it.  The featurettes are what make the disc worth it, especially Scoring Resident Evil, which talks about Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson teaming up to do the film's score.  All in all the disc is okay, I just hope there will be a director's cut sometime soon.",3.0
"As a fan of all the video games I was thrilled when I heard the long awaited movie was finally hitting theatres. The first dissapointment to me was the story. I hoped it would have all the classic characters from the game. Also, I wish the movie was in the mansion, however, I soon got over this as I watched because there were some redeeming qualities. Anybody can say their thirst for zombies was fulfilled as I have never seen so many on a screen since Night of the Living Dead. Also, the movie is very suspensful and there a few slow instances. There were some jumpy times but I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie...(its more action).  This movie is a lot of fun and a good rent but I probably would not buy it. The story brought the grade down a full star because even after watching it a second time I still didn't fully understand what was going on. So its up to you. A good rental for a party with friends but nothing more. 7/10",3.0
"I am not a fan of the games.  I rarely (if ever) pick up a video game.  I know about the ""Resident Evil"" games, I know it's one of the most popular of items.  This movie just lacks ""something.""  You can't really put your finger on it but overall it's great eye candy.  Great special effects, awesome sound and for once, a good plot!  The biggest problem here though is, for a video game turned movie, this DVD sure lacks quite a bit of inspiration!  Where's the deleted scenes?  Where's the ""fun"" extras??  Where's the fun???  All are missing unfortunately.  So, I guess we'll have to wait for the real deal when Blade 2 comes to DVD in September.  In the meantime, this DVD is worth a rental.  Cheers!",3.0
"The movie itself was overall enjoyable.  It had terrific special effects, but yet the whole movie was not special effects.  Some of the zombies did have to go on the blue screen, because they couldn't just do that with make-up.  You will understand when you see the movies.  The bad thing about this movie, is the plot, and that the zombies are really the star of the show, not the licker, and not the main character.  The plot was almost laughable, it had nothing to do with RE games, but I'm sure that the ""movie makers"" had good reason for this.  The characters weren't developed, I only really felt sorry for Michelle Rodriguez, she was the star of the show.  She was ""hot"" in many scenes with her tom-boyish approach in the movie.  She was the only one the cracked any jokes in this movie.  Milla Jovovich was good, she looked reallll good in clothing that barely covered her.  Thats one reason why I saw the movie.  The licker look just like the game, but the special effects that used to create some part of the licker, except the train scene, were again, laughable.  It looked like the licker was put together in a minute.  I hope they do the RE series justice in the sequel.  As I said before, this movie is for you if you like blood, gore, women in skimpy clothing (Alice), and things lurking around the corners.  The zombies really made this movie bearable to watch, and Milla a.k.a. Alice.",3.0

"In this updated version of a lover's triangle sees Joey in love with Linda English, a poor struggling singer, as well as Vera, a high-class dame. There are some good numbers and some funny lines as Joey sees a chance to get what he has always wanted: his own joint, a night club with class.

A good movie but not one of Sinatra's best.",3.0
"First of all, I'm a big Resident Evil fan, the game that is. But this movie is just a little disappointing. The sound is off somehow, sounds like they are far away or something. One would think that they would at least spend a bit more money to help support one of the best game series ever created. I did like seeing Milla kick some ass in a skirt though.",3.0
"This movie starts off slow, but take heart...it takes off in a whirlwind of action.  A group of scientists, working in a secret installation known only as ""The Hive"", play God, experimenting on DNA and creating a mutating virus.  When an attempt is made to steal the virus, the thief unleashes the virus.  The Hive's security defenses, in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading, seals off the facility, killing all within.  A special military unit is sent to discover the reason behind the deaths at the facility, and to shut down the ""murderous"" main computer controlling the security defenses within the hive.  What they don't know is that the virus that was unleashed mutates the dead into nightmarish zombies.
Although the action is slow in coming, when it hits you're in for a rollercoster ride!  The movie is very true to the game.  The  zombies move exactly like those in the game, even when they are being shot.  Milla Jovovich is every bit the action heroine.  At the beginning of the movie she appears to be a helpless damsel in distress, but we soon learn that she's anything but.  And there are even some genuine surprises in the end.
My only gripe with the movie is that it reminds me all too much of Aliens.  A slow start, followed by extreme action and bloody deaths, a strong female lead.  Even the military unit reminds me of the Marines in Aliens.  The character played by Michelle Rodriguez is reminiscent of Vazquez from Aliens.  And the plot twist is also similar.  However, all-in-all this was a pretty decent movie inspired by a great video game.",3.0
"Some fans of the Resident Evil video game complained that the film was not true to the game; I have never played the game, so I can't comment on that, but in a sense such a criticism is neither here nor there. It's more important to know that Resident Evil is as much an homage to George Romero films as it is to its video game origins, although I am sure many tried and true Romero fans won't like Resident Evil for its somewhat poor and certainly imitative borrowing of Romero's zombie ideas. Resident Evil doesn't stop there, as it borrows from other sci-fi and horror films; the method the Red Queen uses to kill several characters trapped in a corridor is lifted right out of the low-budget, cult favorite (and successfully eerie) film Cube. Paul Anderson is a talented filmmaker, to be sure, and Resident Evil is a slick looking film with sparkling clear photography. Anderson's screenplay isn't as simplistic as one might expect from this type of movie and it proceeds through a series of flashbacks to tell part of it story. Milla Jovovich, whose energy, presence, and looks always out-pace her acting, is just the type of actress to play Alice. Add to that the nice touch of giving the Red Queen the voice of a young British girl, and you have a film that rises above mediocrity ... even if it never really impresses.
It doesn't help this film that zombie movies in general are difficult to take seriously these days, unless the zombies are tounge-in-cheek. But Resident Evil is fun and slightly scary. Just remember that this is derivative, not original, filmmaking and that you too can own this DVD for less than full price. That would be the justification for actually owning it.",3.0
Songs were good but really did not have much to do with the story. I like Frank Sinatra much better when co-starring.,3.0
"Fun movie, but not very deep. Great to see Sinatra at his vocal best. Glad I rented and didn't buy though.",3.0
"Being a fan of the ever-popular Resident Evil video game for both Playstation and Gamecube, I found the movie to be somewhat of a disappointment in that aspect, however for a movie alone it does an average job. The actors do their best to interact with the obviously bland and remarkably unoriginal plot, and the special effects make for some excellent scenes.
The movie is cohesive in the respect that I saw how the writers didn't make the fatal mistake of taking the famous game plot and drive it into a movie, they used the names of a few key events and objects (Umbrella, T-Virus, Raccoon City) and rebuilt the movie to fit into two hours of action that didn't require puzzle solving and boring backtracking (though you see in the movie less than thirty different scenes I think!)
The movie is a good fling for some entertainment (but if your a gamer, don't expect Jill or Chris to blow anything away!) The movie made its mark as yet another video game-movie transfer and it ranks, like its previous attempts, mediocre. I think that the game to movie idea needs some more time to develop, after all the average video game lasts three to sixty hours now, so movies are a bit pressed for a descant transfer!",3.0
"Good quality, so-so movie.",3.0
"I think that anyone who went to see 'Resident Evil' expecting character development or a witty script are foolish.  This is the kind of no-brainer entertainment that is good fun at the cinema and from this perspective it is actually pretty good.  The story has Jovovich playing a...babe with memory loss who, along with a group of army officers infiltrate an underground research facility called The Hive.  Unknown to the public above this is where the hugely influential Umbrella Corporation has been researching the deadly T-Virus, that reanimates the dead.  However, the Red Queen computer mainframe killed all of the Hive's employees after a security scare.  Now it's up to the cast to find out what went on there.
First of all I'll go through everything that's wrong with this movie.  Most glaringly, there are several long scenes which just have the cast shooting at zombies, which I could have seen playing the game at home.  Other things critics have labelled as ridiculous mostly adds to the movie's trashy fun.  For instance, check out the employees of The Hive, all researching a top-secret virus over cups of coffee and all under 25.  On top of that we have Jovovich parading about in a red dress split at the thigh, and whilst the rest of the cast are bitten and maimed she remains with a few delicate smears of dust across her face.  Unfortunately, the story is very inconsistent, and for a while the audience can't be sure what's going on, why Red Queen's mainframe couldn't be overriden from outside and who everyone is supposed to be.
Still, there's actually plenty of elements here that mean 'Resident Evil' is a cut above other computer game adaptations.  Despite being almost totally reliant on dumb jump scares, there's a few things here that have the ability to make you recoil in disgust and a few other creepy elements.  For anyone that's seen similar movies, you just know that when we focus in on the dead woman pressed against the glass of a research lab that she'll open her eyes suddenly.  Thankfully knowing what's coming doesn't take away from a lot of genuinely enjoyable aspects.  For example, the Red Queen's manifestation as a little girl is great fun, as are the zombie Dobermans and Michelle Rodriguez is fantastic in what could easily be a very unrewarding role.
Although this is certainly no classic, it's a good watch and is a lot better than 'Tomb Raider' or 'Street Fighter'.  Even so, anyone over the age of 30 will be scratching their heads, but that's probably the idea, what with a Slipknot-laden soundtrack.",3.0
The picture was not much better then the standard version. The blu ray had more color and more grain then the standard dvd. It was not worth paying the extra amount of money for this Blu Ray. It's just O-K . I believe the company manufacturing this film may have done better work. I hope this helps. Sound was the same on the Blu Ray compared to the standard Dvd. Again not worth paying many times more then the standard dvd.,3.0

"...well I haven't yet and I don't think any of you have either.  This movie is only a small facet of a complex and entertaining genre.  If Resident Evil the Movie is the only exposure to it you have had, I pity you.  When judged individually as cinematic creation, I think this movie fails in a number of fields.  However, if you consider just the content of this movie, it does contribute vital material to the RE universe that all of us non-T-virus infected individuals can extrapolate into our own little Raccoon Cities.  For example, I think Milla's character COULD be a very good addition to the RE cast. It seemed to me she had some depth that Jovovich herself, fans, or writers could have some fun with in the future.  That's one of the neat things about having enough electricity in the ol' melon, even if something (like a mediocre movie) isn't totally enthralling by itself, we can find something interesting WITHIN it.
I found interesting things in RE the Movie and I thought it was worthwhile to see it.  If you are a true Biohazard (they really should have kept that) fan, then I don't need to give you any input about buying the DVD...I hope you already have.  If you have not had much exposure to the RE universe then I recommend spending a few dark, lonely nights with the games or Stephani D. Perry's excellent novels.  Build a Biohazard backbone before you buy RETM, then it will be worth owning...",3.0
"I'm not a big fan of zombie films to be honest.  I've never really seen the attraction of seeing crowds of zombies being killed in manical and violent ways.
""Resident Evil"" is no exception to this rule, but somehow it manages to be entertaining enough to warrant your attention.  The story is based on the top selling computer game although luckily, it doesn't suffer the same fate as films such as ""Tomb Raider"" or ""Super Mario Bros."" by being total rubbish.  the script has been made to take a back seat to eye-catching set pieces and set designs.  This sort of film doesn't require you to take too much notice, and the producers have realised this by giving you just enough of a storyline to keep track of whats going on amongst all the neck-breaking and dog-kicking.  Mila Jovovich proves that her acting abilities ain't exactly Oscar-winning, whilst Michelle Rodrigues just walks around looking angry and grunting a lot.  But this doesn't really matter.  If the characters were anything more than two dimensional, you'd get it confused with Robert Redford film and walk out.  You don't have time to ""bond"" with the characters; theres big zombie dogs to kill before they escape and eat all the Winalot.
It's best to view this film with no big aspirations.  It's almost a re-work of ""Evil Dead"", except Bruce Campbell is now a woman in a red dress.
As i mentioned, this film's stand-out feature are the sets and the fight scenes.  The underground ""Hive"" looks superb, and the laser weapon used during the first 45 minutes will have you saying ""Wasn't that also used in 'The Cube' with Nicole DeBoer?""
See this film if you're feeling annoyed on a Saturday afternoon.  Otherwise, watch an episode of ""Jackass""; it's far more intelligent.",3.0
"My friends and I got passes to ""Resident Evil"" on opening night.  None of us were expecting very much, and we got even less.  We only went for Milla Jovovich, and in that respect we got an eyeful (literally...keep your eyes peeled in the end for a brief but well-worth-the-wait shot of nudity).  The movie's got bad editing, terrible dialogue, an awful soundtrack and a storyline that makes even less sense than that of ""The City Of Lost Children"".  It was a good film to hoot at the screen for (and hoot we did), so I would imagine that it would make a perfect midnight selection for a party. However, if you're even tempted to rent it to watch with your buds, I would recommend something truly campy like ""Death Race:  2000"" instead.  Hopefully I haven't upset anyone who seriously enjoyed this flick, but rather than lay the DVD in a place of honor, you'd be better off putting your twenty bucks toward the next ""Resident Evil"" game.",3.0
"Joey Evans (Frank Sinatra) is a two-bit night club singer, womanizer, and cad.  He lands in a San Francisco saloon and starts romancing a wealthy older woman (Rita Hayworth) and sweet chorus girl (Kim Novak).

When I saw this movie in 1957 I fell head over heels for Frank and the sophisticated night club scene, but now Frank's Joey seems like a heartless sleaze, the clubs are cheap, and the movie is hopelessly dated.  It was made at the height of Frank's ring-a-ding-ding movie popularity, though, and he still charms despite playing a mean-spirited and selfish loser who is outweighed by both of his co-stars.  Poor Rita looks drab and tired, a far cry from her earlier glory days.  Kim is lovely (without those thick eyebrows from ""Vertigo""), but her singing voice is a disaster and she isn't much of a dancer.  A beatnik-style dance featuring both ladies is just embarrassing.

On the plus side, the songs are terrific.  The show is filled with memorable Rodgers and Hart tunes such as ""The Lady is a Tramp,"" ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,"" ""I Could Write a Book,"" ""There's a Small Hotel,"" and ""My Funny Valentine.""

The movie is glossy and pretty with lavish gowns and furs and picturesque San Francisco as a location, but is definitely a product of its time.  What was once ultra-cool and sophisticated now seems tawdry and pathetic.  Good songs, though.",3.0

"""Pal Joey"" (1957) makes a sanitized translation to the big screen, with a trio of classic stars - Rita Hayworth, Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak - elevating an uneven, overlong musical. The film is worth seeing for Sinatra's signature tune ""The Lady Is a Tramp"" and director George Sidney's visual stylishness, yet lacks the hard-edged quality of the stage version. Thanks to the prudish Hays Office, ""Pal Joey"" emerges as another casualty of Hollywood censorship.",3.0
"If Frank Sinatra had a signature role in his long movie career, this must be it because he plays one of his coolest cats in this fairly adult 1957 musical drama based on a book by John O'Hara. However, it's better remembered for the fourteen songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, many of which became Sinatra standards. Written by Dorothy Kingsley, the rather slight story has the crooner play womanizing nightclub singer Joey Evans who keeps losing jobs because cad that he is, he likes to fool around with married women. Joey lands in San Francisco and finagles his way into a job as singer and emcee at a dive called the Barbary Coast. There he meets innocent Linda English from Albuquerque, a chorine who refuses to strip and just wants to be a torch singer. In typical Sinatra swinging fashion, Joey flirts with her but plays hard-to-get. One night, both are recruited for a charity show held at a posh Nob Hill mansion. The hostess is Vera Simpson, a former striptease performer who has since become a wealthy society matron. Sparks fly between Joey and Vera but only after mutual acts of humiliation. He breezily moves in with her on her yacht, and she decides to fund his pipe dream, owning a sophisticated nightspot she dubs ""Chez Joey"". Never one to leave his cards on the table, Joey hires Linda to sing, and you can guess the rest as the inevitable romantic triangle takes the expected turns.

Directed by George Sidney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anchors-Aweigh/dp/B00002E223/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anchors Aweigh</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viva-Las-Vegas/dp/B000QUUD56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viva Las Vegas</a>), it plays out rather lugubriously with nary a surprise, but the songs are mostly gems. Sinatra knows how to play heels, though Joey never gets hard-boiled enough to develop a true edge. On the upside, he sings ""There's a Small Hotel"", ""I Could Write a Book"" and best of all, ""The Lady Is a Tramp"" to a guardedly smitten Rita Hayworth well cast as Vera. Even though at 38, she was actually younger than Sinatra, she cuts a coolish (and shapely) figure as a jealous patroness despite the unflattering camera angles. It's just a shame that the story doesn't respect her character much, especially at the very end. However, when she literally lets her hair down, it's a relief to see her old seductive self in post-coital bliss as she lip-syncs ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" (sung seductively by Jo Ann Greer). As Linda, Kim Novak - a year away from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/0783226055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>&nbsp;- fares less well as she looks tentative and oddly blank-faced during her big number, ""My Funny Valentine"" (sung sonorously by Trudy Erwin). But we all know it's really Sinatra we want to see perform, and from that respect, a lot of the movie plays out like one of his 1960's TV specials. The only extras on the 1999 DVD are a couple of trailers and talent files for the principals. An intermittent entertainment, it's definitely a product of a bygone era.",3.0
"THREE STARS AT THEIR BEST. FRANK SINATRA AT HIS SEXIEST, KIM NOWAK IN A GOOD PERFORMANCE AND A FADING BUT STILL BEAUTIFUL RITA HAYWARD. GREAT NOSTALGIA. A GOOD ADD FOR MUSICAL COLLECTORS,",3.0
"This is a less than successful movie version of a hit 1940 Broadway musical Pal Joey, written by John O'Hara, with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. The musical is modified in several ways. Of the original 14 Rodgers and Hart songs, 8 remained with the movie. Sinatra sings classics such as; ""I Didn't Know What Time It was"" and ""I Could Write a Book,"" and ""The Lady Is a Tramp;"" and ""My Funny Valentine"" by Linda English is perhaps the best parts of the movie.

The story is about a singer named Joey Evans (Frank Sinatra), known for his womanizing ways is an out of work singer looking for a job in San Francisco. He meets a chorus girl named Linda English (Kim Novak), slowly, but steadily their friendship blossoms into love and romance. In the meantime, he develops a relationship with a wealthy widow named Vera Simpson (Rita Hayworth) to seek her help to finance his dream, ""Chez Joey"", a night club of his own. When the new night club is about to open, Vera finds about Joey and Linda, and she asks Joey to fire Linda, and he refuses, and Vera withdraws support for the night club. Joey and Vera use each other to the bitter end, ultimately Vera gives in, and Joey wins not only the club but also his prize, Linda. The movie has somewhat unrealistic ending; strong performance of Frank Sinatra overshadows the contributions of his costars Rita Hayworth and young Kim Novak.

"I have played all the games in the RE series (even the crappy Game Boy one) So I kinda knew the basics of the Resident Evil world. This movie is a prequel to the first RE game, showing how the virus infected Racoon City. Pretty good story, and special effects, but the acting and camera work could be better.
For the life of me can't see how they got the microphone in so many scenes in this film, every other shot you see the damn thing hanging over the actor's heads.
If you liked the RE video games, you'll like this movie more then most. And you'll get the little ""hints"" that people who haven't played the game won't, like ""I want him in the Nemisis Project"". Someone who plays the RE games knows the ""Nemisis"" is the main bad guy from RE3 on the Playstation. But as a zombie movie, it is ok, nothing special.",3.0
"While the Resident Evil movie adaptation of the game didn't hold any Acadamy Award winning performances or groundbreaking special effects, it was a great popcorn movie.  It was truly scary in some parts and had practically non-stop action throughout.  During the action scenes, all I could keep saying was, ""I wish I had a game controller and could play this!""  That, and how cool it was.
  The movie's musical score, composed by none other than Marilyn Manson, was really well done, adding a definite techno-horror feel to the film.  One track, called ""Seizure of Power"", is a really driving piece of music which makes you lean forward in your seet while watching the movie, ready for whatever might come next.
  The story line is rather original, actually.  Anyone who was expecting it to be just like the first game was in for a major shock:  it wasn't.  The story follows a new line of characters, mostly an Umbrella Special Forces team, sent to the Raccoon City Secret Umbrella Lab (called the Hive) to shut down a haywire computer system that killed all the scientists in the lab after a T-Virus leak.  It sounds kinda cheesy, but, believe me, the first time the Red Queen (computer system) warns the team to leave, chills will run all over you!
  All in all, Resident Evil is a really fun action-horror film for both fans of the game and horror-movie buffs.  It's a great movie to watch on a Friday night with some popcorn and a thunder storm outside!",3.0
It is pretty good,3.0
"I have played none of the video games so I must judge Resident Evil as a movie alone, and this is a good one.
There is a disappointing beginning which sets up the movie as standard Hollywood formula (i.e. garbage). As events progress it becomes clear that the writers actually know how to make a good movie (we must keep Hollywood from killing or corrupting them!). There is a scene which looks like a formula-movie contrived ending, but it isn't the end! This gave me a letdown, followed by a swift kick; an incredibly refreshing approach to audience entertainment.
The atmosphere becomes extremely intense after the Doomed Elite Team discovers they have been lied to by their employer, the Faceless Evil Corporation. Be warned: There are a lot of cheap scares, especially with the infected bodies (zombies) and I felt that detracted from the overall effect.
I don't normally get into horror, but Resident Evil is effective. I'm already waiting for the sequel.
Wow, what a ride.",3.0
"Well first off this film was far above any expectations that I ever had. I played all the RE games to come out on PC and playstation, anyone who hasn't played them should know that these games are legendary and coined the phrase 'survival horror' to describe their puzzle solving/action/horror/roleplaying style. Playing throught the games themselves is no so far detatched from watching a film as they have story lines (quite good ones too) and closing credits. They are a really great suspensefull and in their own right cinematic experiance.
After the slew of terrible video game films (Mario brothers, the live action street fighter, double dragon, two mortal combats and the extremely [bad] tombraider film) I was expectining a terrible unwatchable film. Anyway I got a hold of a bootleg and was surprised to find that the movie was very decent. The sets are close to the gaming enviourments, especially the train (a scene from the game when the monster attacks throught the wall of the carige is recreated in the film) and the mansion while not the same as RE 1 still had the same feel and decor. The story was in line with the game plots, which is great seenings how I expect some wise guy director to rewrite the story for 'his film'.
There is plenty of nail biting suspense, ...But still I cannot bring myself to really like this movie even though it is true to the games simply because it completely lacks any graphic flesh eating scenes. I guess that truely gorey scenes are not in vogue in mainstream horror productions which is a shame because with such a big special f/x budget and some first 20minutes of saving private ryan quality make up, they could have created some truely gut wrenching zombie flesh eating scenes. I mean it is no where near as great as zombie films like braindead (or a hidiously cut dead/alive in the states), dawn/day of the dead, zombie, beyond ect it would be piontless to list the amount of supieror ""zombie"" films, not to memtion it would require more that 1000 words just for the titles.
So in conclusion this is hands down the best game to movie adaptation ever! But if like me you enjoy a good zombie flick and are expecting gore, gore and more gore you will be sorely disappointed. Highly recomended for the squeamish.",3.0

I could rave about the ending, which was about the only thing besides the 'Lurkers' that was dead-on.
I could rant about the blatant 'Dead' rip-offs.
But what I'm here to speak on is the zombies.
Regardless of the Encyclopedia Britannica definition of these creatures, we all know zombies in cinema eat human flesh. And we all know when you rip someone's guts out of them, they bleed profusely. Plus, you see guts. And we all know that when a zombie takes a chunk out of your carotid artery, you should be shooting bright red fountains.
Not to mention they're sloppy eaters, so you would expect, um, 'leftovers' over the floor.
Why am I getting into all this detail? Because every horror buff knows that's what happens when zombies eat. How do we know this? Becuase Romero, Fulchi and company have taught us so. And now you want to pass this [stuff] off as horror? Please. The game is far more realistic, with the asdded bonus of a more believable plotline.
You don't make a zombie film and then neuter the zombies. ...No? That's why.",3.0
"Hi Fans.
I'm Alex from Germany. I saw this movie in a preview last week an I'm surprised, that I haven't been disappointed.
This film is far away of being nearly as good as the game, but it's worth being seen. Good camera. Good action. Good Fx. Good entertainment.
As a really big Resident Evil-Fan I'm looking forward the Sequel.

"I don't get to watch television much, so, it's rare I see any previews for movies. However, a movie being made out of one of Playstation's better games, Resident Evil, shouldn't have evaded me before it was released. I mean, I know that their making new Halloween and new Friday the 13th movies.
Resident Evil is based off of the video game. It has an almost no-name cast, with an exception to Michelle Rodriguez, that you may remember from the Fast and the Furious. It incorporates aspects of the Matrix, in fact one seen where the main star, Milla Jovovich, is battling Zombie Dogs, she runs up a wall and performs nearly verbatim the same move that takes place in scene one from the Matrix. There is even a slow motion bullet scene at the end of the movie. The acting wasn't top notch. In fact, it left a bit to be desired, and the script wasn't done very well either. The only redeeming factor is that it had top notch sound effects and a lot of cool independent scenes. Such as the defense mechanism of lasers that the computer has. That part was cool, but again, it was stolen from another Keanu Reeves film, Johnny Mnemonic. So, the special effects are almost primitive now.
Overall the movie was good. Worth seeing in the theatre simply for the sound effects. I enjoyed it. I may buy it. There is going to be a sequel. Hopefully it's better.",3.0
"My daughter enjoys this movie because of all the singing. However, the sound seemed to be lagging behind the video or would cut in and out so not sure what the issue there was.

"I'm a big RE fan (since that first zombie seen in RE 1 that made everyone jump).  Now, I'm wary of video game-based movies, but I also remember a movie the director did called ""Event Horizon.""  I must say, I'm impressed, not only with the plot, which fits nicely into the whole RE storyline, but also the choice in actors, the visual effects, and of course, the ""jump"" factor.  It does help if you are familiar with the games (there are references to lickers, hunters, and the Nemesis), but if you like being scared, you'll like the movie.  This was an awesome movie, and I look foward to owning it on DVD.",3.0
I love musicals.  Great cast!,3.0
"I cannot believe how many people post reviews based on previews and what they have read. I saw it last night and some of the rumors should be cleared up. The movie does not have Jill Valentine in it, and the Licker does not ""gain power"" by eating zombies. Now....
I really enjoyed the movie. There is a girl who is reeeeeally ripped off of the ""tough chick"" in other survival horror movies, the movie rips off Dawn of the Dead (almost word for word at one point) and other movies stated here in other reviews, and it does not have the same feel at all as the game, but I can't help it -- Despite all my criticisms, I really enjoyed it. The music is really unique and I think contributes a lot to the overall mood. My main beef with the film is that it is not a movie about zombies, monster plants, hunters, lickers and tyrants and everything like the games are, but it is a movie about zombies. Zombies and one monster. Still, gotta love the zombie dogs, been waitin my whle life to see zombie dogs, lemme tell ya. The ending is pretty good, I think, and hopefully the movie will do well and the sequel they have planned will get to be made.",3.0
"...I saw this beautiful gem of a movie on the opening night! Definitely the best video game adaptation to date so far for the big screen. While the acting and plot may not have been the strongest, it definitely left me entertained and eagerly awaiting the next installment. The information presented in the movie links the mansion with Raccoon City, as well as a decent description of how the T-Virus created the zombies after the squad arrived 6 hours onto the scene.
The initial confusion is a bit annoying, but once the flashbacks are experienced and the reason for the ""confusion"" are revealed you'll go, ""Ohh...I get it.""
The use of new characters on Anderson's part was brilliant as people couldn't figure out who lived and who died, if they didn't read any interviews with Paul anderson, the director. The use of special effects wasn't that much, as least not what the trailers show. Most of the SFX scenes are in the trailer, the rest is brilliant use of prosthetics and make-up, good ol'movie magic! For a movie done with such a low-budget, it sure as hell surprised me! Definitely recommend it if you are a hardcore RE fan or if you just want something to get your blood pumping. It'll be #1 in the box office for one week though, cause next week is 'Blade 2'...",3.0

A must see movie.",3.0
"Resident Evil is from the source movie goers have learned to fear most--video games.  Resident Evil joins the glittering pantheon of such other video game to movie translations such as Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and even Super Mario Brothers.  It's certainly better than most of these but still is far from being a great horror film.
The original game started with the simple and uncluttered premise of being stuck in an isolated mansion with mysterious flesh eating mutated zombies and assorted other biological abberations that had to be fought past in order to find out that the whole mess originated from corporate experimentation in biological weaponry.  The game showed through clever use of shock effects, disturbing dramatic camera angles, and cinematic music that video games could be as scary and suspenseful as any horror film. In this way the game was a groundbreaker and amazingly influential and popular.
Now several years and game sequels later we have Resident Evil the movie.  The film clutters up the premise quite a bit.  Beginning with some unexplained corporate espionage that causes a spooky HAL like computer to kill everyone in the Umbrella building (or as it is explained later an underground hive) it cuts immediately to a half naked Milla Jovovich (she of the crazy red hair in The Fifth Element) waking up with amnesia in a shower and wandering alone in a strangely deserted palatial mansion that the computer is also monitoring.
Where are the zombies?
They do eventually show up and the creators of this film also borrow heavily from past successes such as Aliens, The Matrix, 2001:A Space Odyssey, and maybe even a little Memento.  The result is a mess and some of the action is incomprehensible sometimes it seems certain characters make their escapes out of impossible situations by simply being edited out of them. But the movie keeps moving frenetically and sometimes entertainingly along anyway.  The rest of the plot revolves around the mystery of the sabotage and a trip down into the sealed hive to solve the mystery.
Fans of the video games will be disappointed to not see Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine make an appearance.  Also zombies, hunters and mutant dogs are pretty much the only mutant monsters you get.
As far as the cast goes moviegoers will be left mainly remembering Jovovich's charming beauty and Michelle Rodriguez's(from the much superior low budget Girlfight) tough funny turn as one of the band of clean up soldiers who accompany Jovovich down into the hive.  Sure its a lift of Private Vasquez's character from Aliens but Rodriguez has such a gritty delivery that she makes the tired dialogue sound fresh and intentionally amusing.
The thudding rock score by Marilyn Manson does little to help and the various creatures are not imaginative enough to really inspire any horror.  There are various shock effects tactics employed throughout the film to keep moviegoers from getting restless.
The movie is an okay ride and probably worth a peak if you're a big zombie or Resident Evil fan.  Most of us will get more out of watching Aliens again.",3.0
"I hope the negative media reviews of Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy don't cling to RE before it debuts. I think it should stay exactly like the game. Paul Andreson said using Jill and co., fans would know who was killed and who survived. Yet,reading the reviews on the website Anderson ALREADY TELLS YOU who's going to live and die. So much for that reason! Being an overseas film,having B-rated actors/actoress+ its's a horror flick,it probably will dive. I love the game and have the action figures but I also know the film industry. So here's to the hope of being wrong and it becomes a smash (at least for them to make 2 and 3)  P.S.

"This is a seriously flawed version of the musical, only really saved by the strength of the source material. The move from Winter to Summer did not help the plot, and the insertion of a wholly unneeded chase sequence ending with a death-defying hang off a bridge (not to mention the almost cartoonish yet brutal violence) takes a great musical for kids and - if you can imagine - dumbs it down for adults. The audio quality is so incredibly varied, you can have somebody sounding like they were recorded live on the day speaking with somebody who sounds like they're coming out of a period radio. The dance sequences are generally good, though seemingly inserted into the film with a crowbar. Choosing John Huston as the director was a big gamble... one which did NOT pay off. But enough good stuff comes through from the score and casting that many of its flaws (Punjab? Really? And check out the dueling stereotypical ethnic music styles as the Asian driver and the African Punjab have a dance-off in ""We Got Annie""!) are only slightly bothersome as opposed to the horrorshow they would be were the original musical not such an inherently great show.",3.0

It's funny to watch McDonald play Krakauer, as he's always the villain in so many B-movies. He does a good job as the author here, but the biases of the book are repeated and there are some overly sharp portraits drawn, especially of Fischer, who comes off as more of a jerk than in the book. Too much happened up there to squueze into 90 minutes of drama, seems like; this feels too compressed.

"Having read Jon Krakauer's Everest memoir, Into Thin Air, I decided to get the DVD of the movie.  The movie version of Jon's book isn't bad, but I think it falls just a little short of Jon's written account of his climb up Everest in '96.

In the movie, Christopher McDonald plays Jon; Nat Parker plays Rob Hall, the leader of Jon's Everest climb; and Peter Horton plays Scott Fischer, the leader of a rival group of climbers.  As in the book, the movie details how a lack of oxygen, small mistakes, and Rob and Scott's eagerness to get to the top--and pressing on despite storms brewing near Everest's summit--combined to cause the disaster.  Among the mistakes laid out in the movie were Scott's Sherpa guide Lopsang towing climber Sandy Pittman by rope even though he hadn't been instructed to do so and Jon's fellow climber Andy Harris accidentally turning up the regulator on Jon's oxygen tank full blast while suffering forgetfulness brought on by a lack of oxygen.  Also, Rob disregarded his own turnaround time of 2:00 p.m., which everybody on his team had agreed to so that they'd have time to get back down safely even if not all of them reached the top of Everest by that time.  Indeed, as depicted in the book and the movie, Jon and his guide Mike Groom were the only two people from Jon's expedition who reached the summit and then got off Everest alive.  However, the movie also includes the inspiring story of Jon's colleague Beck Weathers, who, despite nearly dying from frostbite, walked into camp one day after everyone had given up on him and eventually recovered.  Beck, as the ending shows, lost his right hand and all the fingers on his left hand and underwent the reconstruction of his nose, but he still was able to return to his work as a doctor.  The most memorable scenes are Beck's near-death experience and miraculous recovery; the scene where Jon ran out and banged on pots and pans to guide the climbers who had gotten lost after the disastrous storm on Everest; Rob's dying phone conversation with his wife, Jan, who was pregnant and was talking to him from New Zealand; and the closing scene, the memorial service at Everest Base Camp for the climbers who perished on the mountain.  The scenery is majestic, and I got a sense of the climbers' desperation as they struggled just to survive on Everest.

However, the movie version of Into Thin Air, in my opinion, doesn't do the book justice.  For one thing, the movie was mainly concerned with what happened on Everest and not how the characters got there.  To be sure, it's hard to get all the details of a book into a 90-minute to two-hour movie.  However, in the movie version of Into Thin Air, we don't really get to know the characters personally.  There's just a brief exposition before the climbing scenes commence.  This is unfortunate because in reality, once they got into Nepal, Jon and his fellow climbers spent quite a while on the trail on the way to Base Camp.  Also, Jon and his colleagues, once they got to Base Camp, spent three weeks there before making their summit bid, using that time to make several forays above Base Camp in order to get fully acclimated. A lot of the characters aren't really well-developed either.  In my opinion, Rob, Nat Parker's character, is more interesting than Jon(as played by Christopher McDonald) or Scott(as Peter Horton portrays him).  Rob's New Zealand humor provides occasional comic relief for an otherwise dull--and eventually tragic--situation.  Also, since we hear Rob talking to his wife on the phone just before he dies, we get a sense of how much he loved his family.  We don't hear Jon conversing with his wife back in the United States, even though in the book, he and Linda had phone conversations on numerous occasions--and Jon, in the book, is the protagonist and author!  I think, too, that the movie understates Jon's emotional reactions to what happened.  In the book, Jon was overcome with grief and guilt at the loss of his friends.  In the movie he's portrayed as a self-absorbed guy who went up the mountain because of personal ambition--and when his friends(Andy, Rob, Scott, Doug Hansen, and Yasuko Namba) start dying, we don't see him exhibit any anguish.  Indeed, in the movie, Jon cracks up only twice:  the first time when he is standing over Rob's frozen body, and again at the very end, when he talks about his dead friends at the Base Camp memorial service.  The movie's portrayal of Jon, in my opinion, is demeaning.  In the book Jon wanted to get up Everest very badly--almost at the exclusion of anything else--but he still grieved for his friends.  Furthermore, I think that in at least one place in the movie, there's some obvious stretching of the truth.  The scene where I most doubt the credibility of director Robert Markowitz and writer Robert Avrech is the scene where Jon, having failed to rescue Rob, discovers the latter's frozen body.  In the written account, Jon did not try to go after Rob because he(Jon) was shivering in his tent and concerned with his own survival.  Anatoli Boukreev, a guide on Scott's team, was the one who coordinated most of the rescue attempts on the mountain.  Rob's body was actually found some time later by climbers Ed Viesturs and David Breashears as they were making their way to the top of Everest.  Also, I think the filmmakers' portrayal of Anatoli, one of the heroes of the expedition, is off base, although the movie truthfully recounts his heroism in the wake of the storm.  Anatoli, as Jon wrote, was a dedicated guide who helped find several of the climbers who were lost, even though he had to descend ahead of his teammates because his rescue attempts used up a lot of his oxygen.  Markowitz and Avrech portray Anatoli as a ""he-man"" type--boorish, uncooperative, and sometimes argumentative.  In one scene, Anatoli and Scott get into a heated fight over Anatoli's responsibilities as a guide.  Although Anatoli got criticized for the way he did his job and for descending ahead of his team after the storm, I didn't see any open hostility between him and Scott when I read the book.  Another discrepancy between the book and the movie is that in the book, Rob didn't see the Taiwanese climber as the climber came out of his tent shod only in his boot liners and slid down the mountain to his death.  The Taiwanese group was on Everest at the same time as Rob's and Scott's teams but didn't go up the mountain at the same time.  Finally, the movie stops after the memorial service and doesn't include Jon's adjusting to life back in the United States.  I concede that the movie is an abridged version of Jon's book.  However, in real life, Jon had to deal not only with missing his dead friends and getting used to being at home again but with the hate mail he received after writing the magazine article which was the impetus for his book.  As Jon wrote, the hatred coming from the pens of his critics made the aftermath of his Everest climb even harder to deal with than it already was.  Markowitz and Avrech completely overlooked this part of Jon's story--and I think that the criticism Jon received, not just for the role he played in the deaths of his friends but for going up Everest in the first place, was a key element in his book.  Still, as an adventure story, the movie Into Thin Air is not great, but it's all right.  The movie, like the book, shows us how people react in a desperate situation and how even little things we do can have big consequences.",3.0
"The movie ""Into Thin Air"" is based on the John Krakauer publication about five or six climbers who died on Mt. Everest during a storm.  The film is not a great piece of cinema drama or even suspense.  The character development is a little shallow and the acting a tad weak.  I have not read the Krakauer book but my guess is that it is much better.  I imagine this might sound a tad mean but I was actually happy when a few people died (in the movie not real life) because they were being brash and annoying.

Still the film is entertaining because I think it captures the dangers of climbing when you do not follow through with the game plan and act like a total bafoon, which the film recreates.  I do not know if this was the real situation for the climbers.  It seems like some of the individuals climbing should not have been a part of the expedition on Everest.  If you want to know what not to do when climbing Everest, watch this film.  The ending was pretty lame, but of course if you have paid any attention to Hollywood in the last few years this movie is still better than a lot of worthless trash on the market.",3.0

A better movie could have been made about the  tragedy, with a different point of view from the book, but a film of  Krakauer's book (especially as a TV-movie quickie), isn't going to be Oscar  material... they did a competent job, and I enjoyed watching it.

Saw the film in its original theatrical run, was ready to leave the Uptown Theater in D.C. but realized Carol Burnett still had more to do, so I stayed.  Been reading the reviews here and don't understand the business about the aspect ratio.  If the reviewers had only the DVD version and not the Blu-ray, then maybe so.  This is what the High Def Digest review says regarding that:
30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels. There is slight softness in the overall image, but Id wager that is by intention as fine detail doesnt suffer. For a musical it offers a lot for the eyes to see and enjoy.  Would love to hear comments/clarifications on this.",3.0

"My wife and I watched this in order to prepare for a live performance in our town (Fort Myers, FL ).  We enjoyed the movie.  Carol Burnett was the most interesting character as Miss Hannigan who runs the orphanage.  I think you would enjoy watching this version.  Go ahead it was fine.

But here is why I give it three stars instead of four - it cut out several songs and completely extracted Christmas from the plot!

When we went to see the touring version of this musical we were surprised to see that the entire story was written as a Christmas story.  No hint of Christmas in this version.  And at least one of the three songs that was cut out of the movie was so good that it should not have been cut.  Oh yes, it was the one song that found fault with democrats.  No problem with lines about republican stereotypes, but someone may have been a bit sensitive about the line ""those dirty rats, the democrats.""

To be honest I was a bit offended that the movie producers would remove the Christmas angle - as Annie's visit with Daddy Warbucks was a Christmas-time publicity stunt.  The cynicism of using Christmas to sell an image, then the warm feelings and grandeur of the mansion decorated for the holiday as Warbucks is transformed into a caring and loving human being through the outcast child!  Salvation of the human spirit through a child ...  haven't I heard that somewhere before?  I wonder if there have been any other movies using that holiday to rake in the dough?  Hmmm...
It must have sounded too crazy for this producer. - I am sad he missed it.",3.0

"Not a bad movie.  There were lulls at times, but maybe you have to be a lover of fly fishing.  Ongoing narrative by the older brother, Norman, from childhood to adulthood.  Would have liked a somewhat different ending for Brad Pitt's character.

It is on par with other movies from the 80's some of it makes sense some of it doesn't. I personally enjoy the movie flaws and all. Let me explain miss Hanagan thing she ie proof some people are neither good nor bad. I personally enjoy the movie. And please tell me upon rewatching it to realize I been mixing up Tessie and Duffy for long time. The mouse seen was what made me figure out Duffy was one of them just a little bit older then Molly Duffy is part of weird trio of 7-8 yr olds. And how I realized Tessie was older one was how when Pepper said Tessie help me move this.  I guess J know now and Iknow what some ppl fail to realize is technically Tessie and Pepper if don't do whatever are told to are of age they could be kicked out because they are considered workers at about 12 or 13. it may have been filmed in 80's but movie is based in 30's so they may seem bit mean but really aren't just doing it so they don't end up scrounging the streets. In the digitally bought one their is little swearing thru out the movie but their was no actual swearing during bridge scene. .,3.0
Terrific scenery! Loved the casting/fishing sequences but the actual movie dragged at times. The narrator's voice could be irritating after a while.,3.0
"I spent the whole film waiting for something bad to happen and even when the film was over it left me with an unsettled feeling. Scenery was beautiful, good acting etc and I may actually have to watch it again to play closer attention to the dialogue now that I know what happens but not sure I would recommend to all. I certainly wouldn't but this under the family section of Amazon Prime were it resides today.",3.0
"I was in the mood to watch this having not seen it in years... i didn't realize how old Faye Dunaway was in this, i thought she was a bit younger and I completely forgot Tommy Lee Jones was in it. It's basically an interesting take on a murder thriller and for that time it seemed really cool, I remember watching it years ago thinking it was kind of ""freaky"" but now it's quite dated. For 1978 it was pretty good stuff, but you get to look back at the vibe of that time, high fashion of the day mixed with cheesy disco-esque music. The entire movie is a type of assault to the senses.",3.0
"The Eyes of Laura Mars, 1978 film

The story begins with someone looking at a book of pictures, then cutting one out. Then a woman is attacked with a knife. Later another woman gets out of bed and looks at a book of pictures. She makes a phone call, but gets no answer. Is photography just a hype for advertising? [Yes, and records facts and fictions.] Are provocative photographs a form of art? [Yes.] One man doesn't like these pictures. Someone has been murdered, she was the editor of Laura Mars' photobook. The next day the models are prepared for a photo shoot. Laura uses a Polaroid camera for test shots outdoors, Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Sex and Violence! Then Laura has a vision, or dizziness. Did she have breakfast? We see street traffic in New York City. Then Laura has another vision. The police detective questions her.

The models and help are in the police station while Laura is questioned. Laura takes pictures of reality, as defined by her camera. Some of Laura's art photos resemble crime scene pictures, and the police are interested. The police find a man's clothes in the murdered woman's closet. They belong to her ex-husband Michael Reisler. He is a writer who has returned from San Francisco. On location Laura has another vision! [Or a hallucination?] We see models being prepared for photography (you just don't push a button). Laura has another vision! [Is she overworked?] Lt. John Neville interviews two models of Laura Mars. [Pill-popping airheads?] While developing pictures she has another vision about those two models, Michelle & Lulu. She goes to their funerals. News photographers show up for ""human interest"". Lt. Neville gets closer to Laura. John offers a revolver to Laura for her protection. At a birthday party Laura gets a phone call from Michael, and uses a double to escape police surveillance. A mistake?

Lt. Neville gets a call about a suspect. The police search the apartment of Laura's employee. He tells what he saw in the basement. ""He pulled a knife on me!"" There is a chase and a shooting. Tommy won't talk. Its over. Lt. Neville visits Laura. But Laura has another vision! There is pounding on her door! Should ""death"" be used to sell things? [Life insurance?] Lt. Neville explains why Tommy acted that way. His talk alarms Laura! She runs to her bedroom and gets her revolver. There is a tense moment. ""If you love me, please kill me!"" There is a shot and a body falls to the floor. Next a phone call to report a death. The caller provides a name. [The ending reminds me of ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"".]

The photographs were taken by Helmut Newton, a fashion photographer whose work featured sex and violence to grab eyeballs. [Whatever happened to him?] This could be a better movie with a better story, it falls down in the end. It seems to be a lower-budget movie, created from a short story whose adaption to a movie reveals its flaws. One value of this movie is its expose of the way shocking photographs are used for advertising in some style magazines. Around this time they published a book with the photographs of ""Weegee"", a news photographer from the 1930s-1950s famous for his pictures of murder victims on the sidewalks of New York. Sexy photographs grab eyeballs like titillating gossip grabs ears. ""Did you hear about ...?""",3.0
"Faye Dunaway is the title character Laura Mars.  Cutting edge fashion photographer of the avant garde, of questionable taste (her forte is sexualized violence), Laura suddenly experiences a vision one night: she wakes up unable to see what is in front of her ... instead she can see through the eyes of a murderer as he kills an associate.  Things quickly spiral out of control as the visions occur more frequently, and her friends are dispersed in the process.  In comes the police, unbelieving of her visions, but none the less forced to protect as it looks as though the killer is ultimately aiming for her.

A taut, yet somehow not so unbelievable love story ensues between Laura and the cop who is to protect her played by a young Tommy Lee Jones (a man always to be involved in films where he is a position of legal authority: No Country for Old Men, The Fugitive, The Client ... you know the rest).  Red herrings abound to an ending that everyone might see coming.

This movie is more titillating (pun INTENDED) than suspenseful or shocking.  A 70s film for sure; as sexuality, nudity, partying, and the decadence of glamour and glitz abound in this film from beginning to end.  I did like it, as it is at least an interesting film that was worth watching once, especially if you like 70s era films. My greatest wish was that Raul Julia was more involved (especially after the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Morning-After/dp/B0009S4ILU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Morning After</a>, which is a similar 80s film, so maybe check it out)!",3.0
"Faye Dunaway is one of my favorite actresses.  She gives a good performance but is limited by a mediocre plot in this mediocre movie.  She is the Laura Mars of the title. Laura is a high fashion photographer who mixes sex with violence in her photography.  In 1978 it was a more controversial issue than it seems to be today. Its thin veneer serve as a token plot theme.

Out of nowhere Laura begins having psychic visions of murders of people she knows which turn out to be real; all committed by the same killer, through whose eyes she envisions the murders.  I say out of nowhere because there is no indication that she ever had psychic visions in her past.  It makes for a faulty plot non-sequitur, especially since she is obviously at least in her 30's when she begins to have these visions for the first time.

Produced by Jon Peters, one-time hair stylist and ex-husband of Barbra Streisand who sings the title song, the story is long on glitz and short on thrills or chills.  There are plenty of topless models getting dressed and some very attractive young women added to cover a very thin plot.

A young Tommy Lee Jones plays detective John Neville who is in charge of Laura's well-being while the killer is on the loose. He is still a few years and film experience away from developing the persona that has made him so popular today.  His performance is uneven at best and he seems to have real difficulties with the role. His performance in the final scene must make him cringe today.

Rene Auberjonois gives the best supporting performance as Laura's agent/promoter.  Raul Julia is credible as her ex-husband but does not have the chance with such a small role to show the potential that would lead to his brilliant performance in ""The Kiss of the Spider Woman"" in 1985.

If you buy it, get it cheap.",3.0
"I saw this movie went it first came out in the late '70's and I have to say, it seems sillier now, and somehow less scary, than it did then.  However, I love the premise of ""Eyes of Laura Mars"".  Faye Dunaway plays a stressed-out, highly successful fashion photographer who starts seeing the commission of violent murders through the eyes of a particularly vicious killer. When he starts targeting her friends, Laura Mars suddenly realizes that she's also on the killer's list, and probably the one person who can stop him/her.  It's an Americanized version of the Italian giallo genre, and it almost works.  Faye Dunaway is wonderfully neurotic as the glamorous, high-strung Laura Mars; she has a world-weary beauty and pent-up energy that fairly snaps when she's onscreen (which is often; she's in almost every scene)--you can't take your eyes off her.  A young and ruggedly handsome Tommy Lee Jones is on hand as the key detective on the case, and a potential suitor for Laura.  Jones had a charisma even in ""Eyes of Laura Mars"", although I feel that, with his Texas accent and homely good looks, he's miscast as a veteran New York City police detective.  The rest of the cast does a credible job, particularly Brad Dourif, in another creepy role, this time as Laura's ex-con driver, and Rene Auberjonois, as her edgy, chain-smoking manager.  Raul Julia, also surprisingly young and fresh-looking, appears (mostly as male eye candy) as Laura's conniving ex-husband, and Darlanne Fluegel and Lisa Taylor are fun as two of Laura's models, and potential victims for the killer.

The cinematography is sufficiently flashy to convey the decadence of the world inhabited by Laura Mars and her crowd.  However, the muted, autumnal colors of Laura's wardrobe seem to be at variance with this world--she should have chic, brightly colored clothing, not the dreadful, ill-fitting costumes that were apparently designed by Theoni Aldredge for this movie.

Although well-directed by Irvin Kirschner, a screenplay partially penned by John Carpenter, and a song performed by Barbra Streisand (producer Jon Peters was her boyfriend at the time), ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" ultimately falls on its face by the time it reaches it's contrived and predictable  ending.  However, the first three-quarters of the film are good enough to make this film one worth owning.",3.0
"Oh the days before TSA, unfriendly sky, smart phone, and speed trap.  These are what make this film very dated.  One character was using the ""brick"" cell phone in one scene.  What a hoot to see that phone!

Rom com films are escapism.  However, the dramatic tension between the two main, Tomei and Downey Jr., is weird.  It was probably because both of them were Manic Pixie Dream Girl/Boy.  Both leads sharing the same disposition and stereotype doesn't create tension nor is it as relateable.  A better rom com and not as dated from the same period is While You Were Sleeping.  I got into it much better than ""Only You"".

However, there are 2 reasons that recommend this film:

1. Location
It's an ode to Italy.  I just did a one month trip in Italy and was at all the locations the film had used, Venice, San Gimignano, Rome, and Positano.  I have a feeling the hotels in Rome and Positano are not on location but sets.  Also, train is very fast and convenient in Italy (yes, even in 1990).  Why rent a car to drive from Venice to Rome, if only for the sole purpose of going thru Tuscany and a far shot of San Gimignano?  I was thinking it's probably before the speed traps.  Now, one can't drive in Tuscany countryside without running the risk of getting a ticket in the mail months after the trip ended.

2. Wardrobe
This is about the only thing not dated in this film.  Tomei and Hunt's clothes and shoes are to die for.  They are still as classy and tasteful today as in 1990.  Tomei and Hunt were at the prime of their beauty and it shows.  Tomei's outfits were classy with a hint of sexiness and whimsy, very becoming.

If you have a weakness for Italy and fashion, I recommend this film.",3.0
"THE EYES OF LAURA MARS D: Irvin Kershner (1978) Faye Dunaway, Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Dourif, Raul Julia, Rene Auberjonois, and assorted disco-era models and fashionistas

  Jon Peters' first production as he transformed himself (with girlfriend Barbra Streisand's help) from hairdresser to movie producer, the movie is a gem of Seventies style at it's finest. The clothes, the hair, makeup, music, attitude, interiors and locations ride the crest of the high-style wave that flooded the world through the Eighties. Combining the improbable worlds of violence and fashion, with a story that centers on a famous photographer (Dunaway) and her ability to *see* her friends and colleagues being stalked and murdered, *Eyes* has moments of serious suspense, but that's hardly the reason to see this movie. Utilizing the actual photography of fashion god Helmut Newton, the film maker has exquisitely captured the 1978 New York fashion and disco scene in a way that none of the recent looks at the Seventies has been able to, but then, again, this movie was *made* in 1978, not 20 years later. The scenes of photo shoots are particularly fun to watch, with one scene portraying a burning car crash in Columbus Circle in which the models, clad in garter belts and fur coats get in a cat fight before the camera. The ingenuous use of *real* models add the precise amount of vacuity necessary to make the surreal shot work. Another photo shoot involves a model dead from a gunshot to his heart lying in a pool surrounded by exotically dressed disco-dancing models and a throbbing disco beat. The plot is secondary to style in this movie, and style is the only reason this movie should be remembered. Favorite moment: Darlanne Fluegel as the model Lulu haplessly trying to explain to the press *why* violence is important in fashion photos.",3.0

Fun for Grandkids to watch.....a little slow moving on the middle.,3.0
"Given that I am quite easy on love stories, crazy about the Italian culture, and think highly of both Marisa T. and Robert D. as actors, this should have been an easy ride for me.  It certainly began with a premise I hold dear - - the notion that there is such a thing as ""the one"" and how we must overcome the forces that tell us to settle.  And so when Tomei's character is initially duped by Downey's character into believing he is the ""damon bradley"" she is seeking, I forgave his lie as an act of desperation by someone who has fallen hard in a split second.  However, for him to then subsequently set up a whole false scenario where he hires a friend to pretend to be the real ""damon bradley"" so he can appear generous and selfless in Tomei's eyes, was nothing short of cruel.  No one with a kind heart would do that to someone they truly love.  And I could never root for someone who had something like this in them. A romantic movie only works if you like both people and their flaws are forgivable -- as opposed to indicative of a willingness to manipulate, repeatedly lie, and consciously hurt someone to win them over to your side (this is especially true if the romantic movie is trying to sell itself as more drama and substance than just hapless comedy).

PS I gave an extra star for the Italian scenery and beautiful hotels chosen for the film.",3.0
"This definitely isn't motion picture at its best.  However, Marisa Tomei always turns in a lovable, humorous performance, as she does here.  She's locked in a fun female bonding trip, one that makes her companion's husband realize he's been neglecting his wife, while at the same time allowing Ms. Tomei to romp around Italy engaging in adventures while she looks for her soulmate.
I did feel a bit betrayed as the film resolved the ""soulmate"" issue, which I won't give away here.  All in all, it's worth seeing once, just for fun.",3.0
Good show but my kiddos don't care for musicals.,3.0
"Let's first make one thing clear: As movies go, I think this is probably one of the very worst romantic comedies I have ever seen. That said, I would still recommend it! Why?

The plot goes little to nowhere,and the film seems intent on lulling us rather than informing us. These characters cannot be known by what Redford puts up on the screen;only by what we can infer. If the conclusion of this film is that we truly no no one entirely, then that conclusion has been accomplished here for a most unsatisfying look at a Montana family as remembered by the author.",3.0

"This film about two brothers growing up at the turn of the century is full of great river and countryside scenes. Life is shown as it was before radio and T.V. The quiet in the house and how people worked and lived in those days was interesting. The movie touches on love and how families drift apart no matter how hard people try to keep them together. Tom Skerrit does a great job as their father who also is a minister who loves to fish. Going to college back then meant taking a train to a far away state and having to write letters back to your family for communication; very different from our lives. Families and communities did things together back them more than now,as choices for entertainment were limited. The film also shows the brother's and father's love for the river and for fishing. It also has some very sad parts which leave the viewer thinking about their own life and what's really important to them.

"It's been some years since I've seen this film, and my feelings about it have changed.

Richard LeGravenese's rich script (which rightly received an Oscar nomination) is ultimately undone by an ending that's sentimental to the point of being maudlin. We do not need to see Robin Williams directing his fellow patients singing ""How About You?"", nor do we need to see him and Jeff Bridges lying in Central Park watching fireworks.

The ending is so /excessively/ upbeat that it makes the darkness that preceded it seem a dream -- but it wasn't. The question of how Williams feels about Bridges' indirect responsibility for his wife's murder isn't addressed, nor is Bridge's need to ask for Williams' forgiveness. The ""happy-happy joy-joy"" ending seems designed to cover up these things.

The image quality of the Blu-ray is mediocre. One expects razor-sharpness (whether or not it's appropriate for the film); one does not get it here. The picture is (of course) significantly better than DVD-quality, but is still a bit ""soft around the edges"".",3.0

"It had been over 15 years since I had seen this movie, and I remember liking it but not much else.  I was not disappointed.  It's after Baron Muchhausen & before (my favorite) 12 Monkeys.  I am a Terry Gilliam film fan, but not that I think all of his work is good. [The Brothers Grimm is just plain terrible]

PROs:
Outstanding direction by Terry Gilliam adapting a story he did not write
Robin Williams & Jeff Bridges give excellent performances & have on-screen chemistry
Robin Williams naked in Central Park, rubbing his butt on the ground:  ""You know why dogs do this?  Because it feels good!""
Decent side love stories
Gilliam's continuing themes of fantasy & redemption
Drunken Jeff Bridges recommending a porno to a woman while working at a VHS video store (reminds me of Clerks a little)
Gilliam does a good job of roping in Williams' antics in the second half so he doesn't overwhelm the story

CONs:

"When radio host Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) inadvertently causes a psycho to go on a killing spree in a restaurant, he is incapacitated by guilt and spirals into an alcohol-fueled depression.  He is offered a chance for redemption when he meets Parry (Robin Williams),a homeless, delusional survivor of that tragedy who believes that he had been tasked with finding the Holy Grail.  Bridges is excellent and Williams overacts entertainingly as one of those oddball characters brimming over with energy that he has played so many times.  Unfortunately, the screenplay and direction have an uneven tone.  Parry's psychological pain and the disturbing Red Knight that tortures him with its resemblance to raw, exploding flesh carry some real impact, but it is buried in a screenplay that is far too cutesy and superficial the rest of the time.",3.0
"Jeff Bridges is a self-centered, big-shot talk radio host, full of venom for the world at large; Robin Williams is a street person who's lost his girl to a gun-wielding nutjob spurred on by Bridges and something he says on his radio show. By accident they meet and become friends. There is something about the Holy Grail, about making commitments, about being accepted, but it's all pretty superficial. The movie floats over a lot of ground and is overly long, but it's a showcase for Williams's looniness. The ""messages"" are very shallow and hard to take seriously, and worst of all is the sappy ending which is infantile and unbelievable. The high point for me: Williams singing ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady,"" which is a riot - though he changes the lyrics at one point from Stonewall Jackson to Michael Jackson, probably assuming this audience never would have heard of Stonewall Jackson. It's that kind of movie.",3.0
"Terry Gilliam is a visionary; with a scope too large for even Hollywood productions.  Visually and structurally tame, this offbeat moral comedy provides enjoyable, and consistent performances from both Bridges and Williams.  The script has its flaws, but subtley it has all the hallmarks of a Gilliam movie, with little visual flairs popping up here and there (i.e. the dark knight in the forest.)  Although, I feel this is the weakest of Gilliam's body of work, it still carries the viewer through with memorable moments worth watching.",3.0

IMHO the sound and video is good. Indoor scenes video is better than outside scenes for 1st 9 DVDs. Before the credits at an episode end there maybe a small rectangle with wiggling diagonal lines in the upper right hand corner, all episodes are prefaced by Mortimer. As others have said there aren't any subtitles.
Leo McKern's video titled McKern's memories is ~ 18 minutes long.  The quality of video and sound for the ""Rumpole's Return"" is same as other episodes. All bonus except for those mentioned above are write-ups on a page NOT a video.
 If you don't have the extras already then this set is ok. If you have all the episodes already it's expensive probably NOT worth it.",3.0
"I was disappointed that subtitles were not included. The British accents, the speed of the actors' speaking, and the off-to-the-side lines that were spoken softly, made this hard to follow. In the first episode I thought Rumpole had lost the case, and it turned out that he had won. I'll keep watching and hoping I get used to the delivery of the lines, but I really wish they'd thought to add subtitles for us Yankees.",3.0

Rider Haggard's ""She"") become a bit overdone. Having read all the published stories more than once, I find the shows faithful, yet I don't love the casting, particularly of the various barristers in chambers. I think Rumpole and Hilda are well-cast, however.

The early shows are clumsy, as if the actors didn't rehearse, but they soon get their act together.

"I got this for $5 at another store.  The quality is pretty bad, it's very fuzzy, I understand it's an older movie but I wouldn't spend more than $5 for it.  I will add that i watched this in the theatres as a child and it just didn't hold up over time.

We recently rented the Disney version and I thought it was wonderful, but unfortunately they cut a substantial number of songs.  Victor Garber was great, as well as Audra McDonald.  Anne Reinking as Grace, in this version, really doesn't have a great voice and I winced through ""I think I'm gonna like it here"". It really was awful.  Albert Finney seems to just scream the entire movie, I don't know why any child would want to to be adopted by him.  This version is just way too long, they really needed to edit a good 20 minutes or even more from this mess.  My kids and I started losing interest about 90 minutes in.  Also, they neglect to use ""NYC"", one of ,h favorite songs in the show and substitute it with a subpar song called ""Movies, Movies"" or whatever and omit ""Herbert hoover"" as well.  Then they add some other numbers like ""We got Annie""' etc and what is the point of Punjab?  Ugh.  Just terrible.

I only wish the Disney version didn't cut any songs because hands down, it's a better version.  Combine that with the 30th Anniversary soundtrack and I think you'd be much happier than owning this DVD.",3.0
"This is a review of the new Blu-Ray Sing-a-long edition.  I have never bought this film before in any format because until now, it was never offered in widescreen.  The new edition looks and sounds great.  I love and dislike this film all at one time, if that makes any sense.  There are moments that it is glorious and moments when I wonder what was going on in the director's mind.  But, with that said.....the good far out-weighs the bad in this film....the cast is marvelous and so is the music.  I have long been a fan of the stage show....so my one big complaint about the film is the changing of the ending from Christmas to July 4th. If my memory serves me correctly this film was a summer release, so that may the reason for the change of holiday.  Christmas just works so much better in the story.  In any case, just getting to see Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry perform their numbers is worth the look-see.  Albert Finney is also a very good Daddy Warbucks......I have friends whose little girls just love this movie.....and though I do not ""just love it""......I find it entertaining and a nice addition to my collection of musicals on Blu-Ray.  And, I must say, the Blu-ray gives the film a whole new dimension ....and it looks more like it did when I saw the movie on its initial theatrical release.",3.0

"Rumpole of the Bailey is a bargain for the large number of episodes in the set. It is not a mystery, but a look at the workings of the British every day legal/court system as it follows Rumpole from his house and overbearing wife; to the office; meeting clients; to the pub; and to the court room. Rumpole is very chatty, forcefully so to the point of being a bit annoying. We are supposed to love him, but I think Leo McKern was acting his part like a stage play rather than the restrain of a movie role. As a crusty older and wiser character, he is not nearly as lovebale as Det Frost. On the other hand, the cases are very realistic, full of human frailities and this aspect draws the viewer onward for more Rumpole.",3.0

"Ugh.

So the only good things I can say about the Blu-Ray version of ""Annie"" is that it's widescreen and has better picture quality than the previous version of the DVD, and it's not expensive.

I bought this one because our daughter loves the movie, but the DVD version looks so bad on a HD HDMI TV. The DVD picture is god-awful really.

I was hoping the Blu-Ray would solve that. Well it doesn't really. While the video is now 16:9, the quality is just still not up to Blu-Ray standards. You know when you've gotten a classic, and they go back to the film and remaster it and it looks awesome on Blu-Ray? Well they didn't do that here. But to be fair it is much, much better than the DVD version.

And for a ""30th Anniversary Edition!"" they added 2 things- ""Sing-Along with Annie"" which consists of, you guessed it, the portion of the movie with the song with subtitles. Lame. And the Ultraviolet version.

Other than that, you still get the Aileen Quinn look-back from the regular DVD, as well as the laughably terrible ""Hard-Knock Life"" remake by ""Play"". Terrible.

So, if you want widescreen and better picture quality, then buy it, but if you're expecting the stops pulled out, especially in light of the Broadway revival, don't.",3.0
"I bought it for my 4 year old daughter and she's thrilled with it. The extra short featuring Aileen Quinn's recollections was charming. I like the casting, especially Finney and Quinn. As for the movie, I think most adults will find it kind of pokey. Wish it was a widescreen version.",3.0

"Is Elmo irritating? Heck yes. I wish he could use the pronoun ""I."" BUT he's a cuddly cute friend to a lot of toddlers out there, mine included. We don't watch Sesame Street at home, but my son must get enough Elmo from the daycare, because he knew who this movie was about when we borrowed it from the library.
The message viewers are supposed to get is about sharing - after not wanting to share his beloved blanket with his friend Zoe, Elmo loses said blanket down Oscar's trashcan and subsequently into Grouchland, where it is claimed by the colorful villian Huxley, who never shares anything.
So our little ones should be learning how to share...unfortunately, one of the more memorable songs is sung by Mandy Patinkin (Huxley) called ""MINE."" My little boy had never grabbed anything and yelled ""Mine!"" until he watched this video. He understood about Elmo's blanket, because he has one of his own that's special, but it seems he got the wrong message!
The film itself is a bit of a mixed bag of images; Vanessa Williams is stunning as the Queen of Trash, but her appearance is like a short cameo. There's a giant chicken that seems loosely related to Huxley. A conveniently placed talking vegetable. This is not the caliber of education and entertainment I've come to expect from the Children's Television Workshop, or from Henson Productions. I wouldn't recommend the video for children under 3, even if they're Elmo fans (my son was 26 months when we had the ""MINE!"" problem.)
Hooray for Ernie and Bert, though, our time-tested film narrators!",3.0

"It's pointless to look for a Hustonian thematic map with Annie, the man had to pay his taxes too after all. So what's left? A musical with fine moments, a half Pippi Longstoching half Shirley Temple character who sings and dances correctly, some catchy songs that linger in the head and the performance of Albert Finney and Carol Burnett. Recommended to Huston completists or to parents looking for a rainy sunday afternoon family movie.

""Annie"" gets a special thumbs up from my 2 year old granddaughter who sings and dances her way through every number and begs to watch the DVD over and over again when she comes to visit me.  It's her absolute favorite movie, one she watches over and over again and never gets tired of it!!",3.0
"This movie has a slam-dunk cast--Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks. Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan. Tim Curry as Rooster. Bernadette Peters as Lily. The original Broadway show has a ton of great, catchy tunes and a pretty tight book. And yet, this adaptation just doesn't work. I know it's difficult to transfer a stage play to film, but Annie would seem to be easier than most, as it already has a big cast and multiple settings. This just isn't a very compelling movie for three reasons: 1) They added songs and took out others. The new songs don't have the ""oomph"" of the original show tunes. In a word, they're boring. 2) John Huston's direction drags, drags, drags. 3) I'm going to say it--Aileen Quinn just didn't have the spark Annie needs. She has no edge, no genuine spunk. Mostof her line delivery sounds contrived. Watch this with a little kid--you'll enjoy it more because she/he will. But if you're a fan of musicals, don't bother with this adaptation.",3.0

Still, it's a fun, classic movie and I wouldn't say it's bad.  I just think the Kathy Bates version is so much better and I would buy that one first.  Our three little girls love it!",3.0
"""It's not as cool as it looks on the front cover.  The scariest part is the end.  And it was very scary when the Russian dude threw the bomb.  I loved 'You're Never Fully Dressed without a Smile.'  And with Aileen Quinn and the little dog Sandy I just loved it.  But what I didn't like was the sexual parts.  One where Miss Hannigan is trying to push Mr. Bundles into his cart and do something to him, and also she tried to push Daddy Warbucks into her bedroom.  And here's something that I liked about it.  They had a famous comedienne in it which was Carol Burnett.  But why didnt' they have 'NYC'?""

Her mom adds:  If you're purchasing an Annie DVD for a child, the 1999 Disney version is the better bet.  While I never saw the original Broadway version so I don't know how Miss Hannigan was played, Carol Burnett plays her as completely in the sauce the entire time -- something Carol Burnett has always done very well but probably not appropriate for children.  This version also has some sexual elements (again mostly involving Miss Hannigan) and there are the scary elements that my daughter mentioned.  On the plus side, Aileen Quinn does a nice job as Annie.",3.0
"Annie is watchable enough, but despite the lavish budget - not always apparent onscreen - it never hits the highs. More solid than inspired, and typically anonymous for a later Huston film, Arlene Sellers characteristically derivative and unimaginative choreography is a problem: all too often at cross-purposes with the plot, the dancers manage to make it look better than it is, but that's not really the idea. Much of the cast are wasted and a couple of the songs thrown away, but at least it's not a disaster of Chorus Line proportions.

The anniversary edition includes a 12-minute interview with Aileen Quinn, music video for Play's version of It's a Hard Knock Life and the trailer, but while the original edition offered a decent but not outstanding 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, the anniversary edition is cropped to fullframe. Sony's region-free Blu-ray offers a similarly less than stellar transfer, albeit in the original widescreen ratio, that doesn't look much of an improvement over an upscaled DVD with the same extras as the anniversary edition as well as three TV spots, the full trailer and a teaser trailer that includes much behind the scenes footage, though not the original TV making of documentary from the film's release that included, among other things, footage of an alternate version of Easy Street to the one used in the film.",3.0

"So much for special edition. Enough complaints have been made about the lack of widescreen format - unforgiveable in any musical since the dance numbers nearly always take up the whole screen.

My biggest complaint is that there are actually lines REMOVED from songs - in ""The Hard Knock Life"", Molly's orders to ""Strip those beds! Scrub that floor!"" have been erased, although there is still a camera close-up that clearly shows her mouthing the words. In ""We've Got Annie,"" a whole series of servants' exclamations are similarly gone. There are several other omissions that slip my mind currently. Why on earth would the editing team take out these lines? If they were going to remove anything, it might at least have been the two exclamations of ""g-dd-mn"" at the end, which are the only occasions of this movie turning un-kid-friendly and were entirely unnecessary. What were you thinking, Columbia?

Get this movie by all means, but get the widescreen version. I don't know whether it shares the problem of ommitted lines, however, and until I do, I'll stick with my old much-loved VHS.",3.0
"I have loved this movie since early childhood.  But I was a little disappointed in the Special Anniversary Edition of the DVD.

There is a nice little extra feature with Aileen Quinn, but I wish it had been longer and more in-depth.  The rest of the extra features were pretty useless and uninteresting to anyone over the age of about 5 (granted, this movie is for kids...).

My biggest complaint, besides the lack of SPECIAL features, is the fact that the language dubbing doesn't match the closed captioning.  If I put on closed captioning in Spanish, it translates the English version of the movie.  But if I switch the audio to Spanish, it doesn't match the captioning- the songs are completely different in Spanish, and I'd like to know the words to them in other languages, but the dubbing isn't of a quality high enough to be able to decipher anything over the music.  And the captioning offers no help at all.

Because that's such a bizarre complaint, and most people won't notice or care, I'm still giving it 3 stars- great movie, one of the special features was interesting.",3.0

I've seen this movie on three different media. All were pan and scan, and all three showed different parts of the picture! The worst was a VHS release. (...)

I don't know which is more frustrating about this anniversary dvd, the fact that it doesn't offer widescreen, or the fact that the dvd menu and the special features show the movie clips in widescreen, teasing me with those brief glimpses.

There is no reason that dvd manufacturers shouldn't at least OFFER a widescreen version. Let's get with the 21st century already!",3.0

"Based on the comic strip, ""Little Orphan Annie"" which later became a Broadway show that, of course, finally became a big budget movie, ""Annie"" is the 1981 musical from producer Ray Stark and director John Huston.  Odd, that neither had much experience with the musical genre until this film.  Some of their inexperience shows up on the screen.  The dance numbers are butchered in the editing and some good talent, though competent in their roles, are wasted nevertheless with a genuinely simple handling of the subject matter.  But what about the transfer - Columbia has made the film available in both full frame and the original widescreen format, enhanced here for 16X9 televisions.  For the purposes of film purists, this review will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film.  Colors are rich and nicely balanced.  Blacks are sometimes weak but nothing that leads to any great disappointment.  However, there are some framing issues, specifically during the ""Let's Go To The Movies"" musical number in which it appears as though someone has accidentally reframed a full screen version of this sequence, instead of using the 2:35:1 aspect ratio image.  Actor's heads are cut off and there is some interfield jittering as the camera pans to capture the action.  Otherwise, the rest of the film appears to have the proper widescreen image framed.  The ending of this movie is still its best part, with a gala party at the Warbuck's mansion yielding rich colors and bold blacks.  Fine grain, dirt, chips and scratches inherent in the original camera negative are visible but not distracting.  Some scenes are softly focused but again, these are brief. The stereo soundtrack 2.0 is ample but scratchy in spots and strident with a slight hiss in others. No great shakes overall but still worth the price for those who truly love this tuneful, though at times top heavy, musical motion picture.  As pure film, this version is still better than Disney's direct to video remake.",3.0

Don't get me wrong, I loved this little ginger fuzz ball for years but sadly the film is inferior to both the true Broadway intention and a more recent Buena Vista / Disney re-make.

Basically why does Hollywood think that they can create a better version than Broadway?  They were way off the mark.  Save your money, wait till it comes  to your local summer live theatre.

Anyway, neat music, a sound Broadway background for the story and, with actors who were really actors, who could sing and dance as well as look pretty

"Having read many of the other bad comments about this movie, I was lead to believe that maybe my own first impression could have been wrong. But then I went and watched the movie again. Wrong! I was right. The movie is great.  I really do not understand how any one can NOT like this movie. AND I HAVE  SEEN A LOCAL PRODUCTION OF ''ANNIE'' RECENTLY. The play, like the 1999  movie is quite nice, but it just doesn't have that spark, and liveliness  that this movie does. What would lead others to call this movie ''charmless  and dull'' is beyond me. I do not agree at all. I have read many reviewers  trying to persuade potential viewers into seeing or buying the new 1999  movie version. ( I have also read an extremely biased nasty review by a  ''Lori.'') I have news for all those desiring to see the new version: it is  a sweet, nice version. But there is no comparison. That movie perhaps does  have a better sense of setting than this old version.( and the play I saw  did have an enjoyable song called '' We'd like to thank you Herbert  Hoover.'') After seeing the play, I wish some of the songs could have been  included here. But the play seemed missing something. People call this  movie ''overblown... happening in a void, overacted...''But this movie was  really TRYING. The actors were confidant, and gave STRONG performances. (  While Alicia Morton as Annie, gave a quiet, calm, quite lifeless  performance, and Andrew Garber as Daddy Warbucks can never compare with  Albert Finney.) I do agree some good songs were left out- and I wish those  had been added here. But certain scenes:( the car chase, the interaction  between Hannigan, and Warbucks) are sorely missed in the new version. This  movie does add a lot of things to the musical. But new characters, and  overlaying, enthusiastc plots make the movie multi-faceted to me anyway.  Plus a lot of songs such as '' We've got Annie'', ''Sign'', and '' Dumb  Dog.'' are very enjoyable. All in all, this seemed to me a nice movie, and  very enthusiastically produced.",3.0

"Charles 'Chuck' Bronson has often been criticised for his minimalist acting style, mainly in the action thrillers he did with Michael Winner, but he is put to effective use in this solid drama, which is a solid debut  for action director, Walter Hill and it also boasts a terrific supporting  performance from that other veteran, James Coburn as the gambler who  becomes Bronson's aide. Chuck's character, Chaney, may not say much, but  you can tell just how he feels by looking at the expressions on his craggy  face, something which Bronson, like Eastwood, can convey convincingly. But  it's the fights themselves that are the highlights, the best one being the  battle in the cage between Bronson and leering, cocky punk, Robert Tessier.  The last fight is good, as well, and Bronson sure does move nimbly for a  fifty four year old!",3.0

If anyone ever made a career out of playing tough guys.  It was Charles Bronson.  He had been in a lot of classic movies like The Great Escape and Once Upon A Time In The West.  But He didn't really become a star until Death Wish when he was in his fifties or something.  So in this he plays a bare knuckle brawler trying to survive in the Great Depression.  It is a very good role for him.  And along the way he meets up with James Coburn.  They had both been in The Great Escape and The Magnificent Seven.  And are a good team in this.  It shows  that Bronson iis a better actor then he was given credit for a lot of time.,3.0

"Twilight Time Blu Ray. Picture quality is great. No commentary though. There has to be someone out there who was involved with the making of this film who could have given commentary...such a missed opportunity! They could have told us what Charles Bronson was like to work with,his preparation for the movie and how he stayed in shape etc(the guy was nearly 55 when he made this and looked as fit as a professional athlete). ""You had better get the money."" and ""you owe me money."" Two lines delivered by Bronson in the movie in true superstar fashion. Would love to see the deleted fight scenes one day..the DVD has stills of Charlie fighting two opponents that do not appear in any version I have seen(would have been nice if those actors had given their input on the blu ray edition)!Think Charlie should have accepted Walter Hill's ""The Driver""  after this as he would have been perfect in it.

My wife and I really liked this device which allowed them to tackle a more difficult villain than they other wise might have. So, cudos for that.

"I've lately been buying dvd's to fill-in my Charles Bronson favorites, and watched ""Hard Times"" (1975) last night.
I suppose if you're a fan of Charles Bronson, this period piece from the Great Depression, about a bare-knuckles fighter trying to earn a few bucks from fights (to ""fill in the inbetweens"") doesn't need either another review, or any particular recommendation. The following comments are just to ""fill-in"" a few things about this relatively little-known film, from the perspective of a life-long Bronson fan, who always has thought Charlie could have been an even bigger motion-picture star than he was, given the right vehicle for his unique acting talents.

The plot of ""Hard Times"" has been well-outlined by the 70+ other reviews already posted to this site, so I won't detail that with more than a brief summary. Suffice it to say, the story is very simple, the outcome rather predictable, and the story also rather brief ( 93 minutes total), and other than for Bronson fans, is likely to have some appeal to boxing fans, and those who enjoy a well-crafted period piece. Chaney (Bronson) arrives hitching a freight-train, and quickly hooks up with Spencer Weed, aka ""Speed""- James Coburn doing his usual excellent job of yet another suave, rakish opportunist: this time as a promoter of illegal bare-knuckle fights. The rest of the story consists of no more than 4 separate fight scenes, with a concluding one against a hired-gun fighter from Chicago. In between is a side-story of Chaney's relationship with Lucy Simpson (Bronson's real life wife, actress Jill Ireland, who appeared with him in many of his films), a lonely local woman with a husband serving some jail time, and a parallel side-story of Speed's troubles with the local loan sharks, who are after his hide, as he is always in debt from his semi-successful hustling.

Many feel this is Bronson's best acting role, even though I think the Chaney character is rather underdeveloped in this film. This is quintessential Bronson: tough guy with a heart, and VERY few words. For my money, as far as Bronson's acting chops go, I thought ""Death Wish"" allowed him to display a much wider, more believable range of emotions that what he is asked to do in ""Hard Times"". However, Bronson's physical persona has always been his strength as an actor, and in ""Hard Times"", the then 54 year old Bronson displays as amazing quickness of foot, along with a pretty devastating right hand. He's a very believable pugilist, though the two main fight scenes are a bit heavy on the every-punch-hits-the-guy-right-between-the-eyes-yet-he-stays-up thing. What would have made this film a 5 star prospect for me was if the director had made this movie about 20-30 minutes longer, and devoted more time to developing not only Chaney's enigmatic, appealing character, but also those of the several other principal actors as well.

As an example: Poe (the accomplished character actor Strother Martin) is employed by Speed to be Chaney's ""ring-side doctor""- we are told in Speed's introduction that he is a good cut man, etc- yet for the rest of the movie, we never see Poe do a single thing for Chaney, during any of his fights. We are told he is an opium addict (like his literary namesake), yet that also never figures into either his character or the story, in any way.

Lucy Simpson (Jill Ireland) is given almost nothing to say or do, in her relationship with Chaney. We are led to believe there must be some romantic attraction between the two, but we are never shown any actual romance. We are led to believe they eventually separate because of Chaney's stand-offishness, but that isn't developed very well in their scenes together either. I thought the whole sideline story of their brief relationship could have added a lot of depth to both Chaney's character and this movie, but unless it's lying somewhere on the editing room floor, those scenes jusy never happen in this film.

The additional supporting actors, filling out the roles of Chaney's and Speed's fighting/promoter competition (Michael McGuire as wealthy-looking promoter Chick Gandil, Robert Tessier and Nick Dimitri as Chaney's two most formidable ring opponents) are done well enough, ironically. The main characters (other than Coburn's admittedly engaging take on Speed) could have used a lot more work, though.

In all, I'd rate this a 3.5 star movie, mainly for the atmospheric recreation of the Depression Era, and the shots of New Orleans, where most of the story takes place, and yes, the acting of Bronson and Coburn, and to a much lesser extent Ireland and Martin. It's worth watching once, but probably worth purchasing only for Bronson film fans, like me.

What I'd really like to see, if it in fact even exists, is a ""director's cut"" of ""Hard Times"", with about 30 more minutes of run time. With a little more flesh and blood tacked onto a few of the main characters, this would have potential to be a real classic.",3.0

"Overall, a reasonably high quality, no frills, DVD. My main criticism is that the full screen format left out a lot of detail at the periphery, for instance in the scene when Chaney (Bronson) challenges Pettibon's Cajun fighter. In the dispute after the fight all we hear is the click of a gun, we are left to assume from the there is an armed man because he is totally invisible. Likewise when Chaney shoots up Pettibon's honkytonk, some of the time he is aiming at invisible targets like the old fashioned pay phone on the wall (I only know this because I remember seeing this film at a movie theater back in the 70's. To appreciate what you are missing you have to compare the wide aspect opening scene (when Chaney hops off a freight train) with the rest of the film. I imagine they only transferred the opening scene in 2.35:1 so that you can read the titles. A wide aspect ratio is important when there is a lot of dynamic action going on and lets face it it's the fight scenes that are the most important part of the movie. Had it not been for this ""defect"" I would have given this DVD five stars, despite the absence of any bells and whistles.",3.0
"I'm a die-hard Python fan.  I even have an autographed picture of Michael Palin he gave me when I was 13 (I'm 50 now).  This box set is way over-priced for just including a flimsy catapult set that you have to get exactly right or it won't fire. The novelty wears off quickly because the catapult sucks so much.  I tried to ambush my grown daughter with it, yet the cow flew backwards and hit me. Hard to put away once you attach the catapult correctly, and I was afraid disassembling it constantly would wear out the cardboard.

The film is old so it is quite grainy on Blu-ray, so no real improvement of picture quality.  There is only one disk.  Not a lot of extras for the price.  Just buy a regular DVD of the movie.

Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!",3.0
"First of all, Columbia-Tristar released a WS and FS edition (2 sided disc) of the DVD on its initial release but reissue with a full screen only. So those interested in the title must search for the older release which contains the WS edition.

This is a great film, one of Bronson's best and also directorial debut of the great Walter Hill. Set in depression era New Orleans, where Bronson had to earn his dollar by ""street fighting"". James Coburn and Jill Ireland costar as his manager/promotor and love interest (Obviously) respectively.

I would like to give this DVD a full 5 stars, but with its lack of special features, I can only give 3 stars. A must have DVD though, the 2.0 mono sound is fine and the WS image is ok but deserved to be cleaned up a bit.

Now with all of the principal stars gone (Bronson, Coburn, Ireland), I am surprised that Columbia has yet to issue a special edition of this movie, while releasing several titles over and over (Fifth element, Leon The Professional, Jumanji, legend of Zorro, etc). Please issue a special edition, as this is more deserving movie. I don't think there is any special edition DVD of Bronson's movies. Not even the first Death Wish. I hope Hard Times will be the first in many special edition DVDs to be released. Remember, Charles Bronson is one of the biggest movie star in the world.",3.0
"This movie earns 5 stars, but I give it a 3 because the DVD itself is a 1 or 2.

I've never been a big fan of Bronson -- who even as tough-guy action heroes go had the range of a Daisy air rifle -- but the role of Chaney in this film is perfect for his tight-lipped, minimal style.

There's no need to add further details of this great man's man cinema beyond what others have already said. Suffice to say it's a sorely needed if temporary anachronistic antidote to this emasculated age of Oprah, metrosexuals, reality shows, and self-help guides. It'd be a good double feature with Emperor of The North Pole or Fight Club. A good, tight, no-nonsense story that doesn't pull any punches or make apologies.

The problem with this DVD is the DVD itself. The print is actually decent for a straight 35mm transfer with only a handful of grainy and artifact-ridden scenes. Audio is passable. The big problem is that it's not letterboxed -- entirely pan-and-scan, and noticeably so. It's time the studio pressed a widescreen version and cleaned it up a bit.

A couple bonus features wouldn't hurt either, but that would just be the proverbial icing. Unfortunately we've lost all of the lead actors so a retrospective would be tough to put together.",3.0

I didn't really like the blowing raspberries part, and I also didn't like how they used the word stupid in a preschool movie.  I may be uptight, but those are things that I want to try avoid exposing my daughter to when she is just starting to talk.  It was cute, though, and the music was catchy.  The style of shooting is also very different if you are used to watching other Sesame Street videos, obviously because it is an acutal movie. Maybe it's one of those things that has to grow on you.

"My son is 20 months and so far he is only interested in the first 10 minutes or so - the opening scene of Elmo in his bedroom and the song ""Together Forever"".

He will point at Elmo's blanket when he is looking for it.  I think the ""Together forever"" song is cute and find myself humming it. Maybe when my son is older he will like the rest although some people think the ""evil"" parts might teach kids the wrong thing.

"Love the movie.  One of my favorites.  Love the transfer to blu-ray.  Crystal clear for the most part (a few scenes were apparently more problematic to transfer and are still pretty blurry, and it can be jarring when you come across those scenes because they really do stand out).  The extras are limited but interesting, and informative, with the possible exception of Terry Gilliam's commentary on the lost animation sequences.  (He really didn't sound very happy to be doing them.)

However, the ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy"" feature on this disc (which is adminstered by Sony) is entirely worthless.  You may think you are getting an actual copy of the movie to watch on your ipod, iPad, or other device at your leisure, right?  WRONG.  The downloadable copy is for your desktop or other primary computer ONLY.  And in order to get that, you must create an account with Sony, give them your personal information, and install their proprietary software (Silverlight) to download and view the copy.  After giving them my name, email and other information (and agreeing to allow them to send me marketing materials at that email address, which YOU MUST DO to proceed with the account creation - there is no way to opt out and still continue), jumping through all the installation hoops and installing Silverlight, it took my computer an additional 6 and one half hours over high-speed DSL to download this +/- 90 munite epic.  Amazing speed and efficiency, no?  Incidentally, the download also overheated and burned out my old DSL modem.

After all that, I tried to transfer the downloaded movie to iTunes.  Guess what?  You can't.  If you want to download it to a mobile device, you have to install additional software, go through the Ultraviolet site again, and essentially repeat the download process on that device.  God only knows how long it will take to download it agfain using an A5 chip...  Then, you can view the movie at your leisure on your mobile device, right?  Not according to the folks who have tried it!  If you are foolish enough to remove your mobile device from your house, you're out of luck!  You see, if you get outside the range of your WiFi connection, the movie will not be viewable.  Apparently the digital copy needs to contact Sony every time you try to view it.  Just a little quirk that Sony forgot to mention to you!  Want to take a copy of the movie on vacation?  Too bad!  Long car or plane ride?  Too bad!  Maybe someone should call Sony and inform them of the meaning of the word ""mobile"" so they stop advertising their ""digital copy"" for your ""mobile device"".

So, buy this blu-ray version movie if you only want the movie itself and do not want the ""digital copy"" (sorry I keep putting it in quotes, but I feel like, if there is no actual copy of the film that you can move around between devices, in what sense do you have an actual ""copy"" of anything?) go ahead and buy it.  Frankly, I can't recommend the movie enough.  Just don't expect to be able to use the ""digital copy"" that comes with it.

PS:  There are a number of movies (like James Cameron's new release of ""Titanic"" on blu-ray) that come with actual, bona fide digital copies. You plug a download code into iTunes, and it downloads automatically.  And you can watch that on any device you transfer a copy to.  Just look for the little ""iTunes"" logo on the cover.  And stay away from anything marked with ""Ultraviolet"".  Ultraviolet is not worth the money, not worth the hassle, not worth the time.  In short, UV copies are worthless.",3.0
"The Film:  Let's just say that this is one of my favorite comedies of all time.  I have lost count of the number of times I have watched this film or quoted it throughout my life.

The Video:  A nice upgrade from the (horrible) DVD, but still a disappointment overall.  The print is cleaned up nicely and the bright exterior shots look decent, but overall the film is too dark, flesh-tones are inconsistent, and its occasionally out of focus (you can see this even more in HD).  It's probably the best this film can ever look, but you'll still wish it looked better.

The Sound:  It sounds somewhat better than it looks with a 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless audio track.  Not at all bad for a 40 year old film that was recorded in Mono, just don't expect it to sound like a modern blockbuster.

The Subtitles (yeah, I'm calling out the subtitles):  Subtitles are included in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and ""Subtitles For People Who Don't Like the Film"", which cleverly inserts scenes from William Shakespeare's 'Henry IV: Part 2' in case you just don't find the film all that funny.

Extras:  19 mins of deleted scenes and outakes in HD!.  Many are funny but too silly for even this movie.

Overall: One of the silliest and funniest films of all time looks and sounds the best we can probably ever hope for it to be.  If you're a fan it's worth it for the upgrade, just know what to expect.",3.0
"Please be very careful if you order this edition of the classic Monty Python comedy.  As I have just learned the hardest way possible, the center pegs in the case require a lot of care and patience when inserting or removing a disc.  Too much force will cause the disc to bend and break.

The center pegs are made of a hard plastic that's all one piece, therefore making it almost impossible to remove the discs without risking breaking it.  As much as I love this movie, I have to give this set 3 stars just because the way the case was made caused me to accidentally ruin the bonus disc, which I was very excited to watch.

Oh well.  At least I got the screenplay out of it.  Once again, this review has nothing to do with the movie.  I LOVE the movie.  I just hate the way they made this case.",3.0

"The Bottom Line:

Romanced all out of proportion, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has its funny and effective moments but quickly runs out of steam and creativity; many people like it but it's certainly no great movie.",3.0
"Well, the movie is awesome, the second DVD is awesome, all the little extras on both DVDs are great. Of course the film is grainy and such, it was meant to be that way.

Now, this version is not as good as another.  The Extraordinarily Deluxe Edition.  It has the DVD and the second DVD.  It also includes the old album that was released of the film ow on CD.  It is packaged nicely (it looks better than this version).

I think it is kewl that they were adding in the Script, but it is already on the DVD itself.  Plus if you just google, you can find it online very easily.  So it really isn't worth it to have it included for this much.  The Extraordinarily version is the one I recommend.  It's packaging looks much better as well as aranged better, it has the extra cd, and it costs less.  With the money you save, you can get some coconuts and play along with the movie.",3.0
"Overall a very good movie but given the passing of time, some parts could have taken us further. The classic horseless riders, coconut clapping grooms, and the British versus French humor are truly timeless. However, the scene with the animation seems in retrospect, a little out of place and the political satire has so much more room for enhancement now. The ending always leaves me a little disappointed and I wonder if they just ran out of ideas on how to end the show? Overall - some good laughter and some very funny scenes. If you have never seen the movie or have forgotten the bits and pieces, it is well worth the price.",3.0

"This is one of my all time favorite movies. BUT- already having the tape and getting the DVD for Christmas was a disappointment. I suppose that I am one of the few people that do not own a widescreen TV and find looking at a movie through a slit very annoying. In this case, the ability to select favorite scenes on the DVD is compromised by losing about 30% of the picture. Why is there no full screen version available, not only on this, but on many other classic films?? Anyone have the answer to this?",3.0
"If you've been waiting for this movie on dvd, get it.  The extras are no big deal, honestly.  The movie quality looks good though.  I'm glad I bought it.",3.0
"The film started out so well.  It had the opening credits with screwed up bogus subtitles, hilarious horse-riding with no horse, smart-alec peasants arguing with a king.  What's not to like, right?  Boy, was I wrong.  The film just took a turn for the worse, when they tossed in the really horrible animation of God giving them the mission of finding the Holy Grail.  They also mixed the present (932 AD) with the future (1975 AD).  It didn't work for me.  The last 30 minutes just bored me.  I couldn't wait for it to just be over with.
I remember liking other Monty Python features more than this.  Disappointing.

P (Plot) - 3 (king arthur looks for knights on his quest to find the holy grail)",3.0
"I like this classic movie and would recommend the DVD to anyone.  Though, if you're a DVD lover who enjoys the extras and behind the scenes features, I would suggest spending a little more for the Special Edition or the Criterion Collection edition.
This is the basic edition and I found the picture on this DVD to be poorly mastered.  Everything is a bit fuzzy and the colors seem warm.  Of course, that can be attributed to the quality and age of the original masters, but this is definitely not the best movie-to-DVD that I've seen.
With that said, the movie is great with that classic Monty Python touch.  You'll find yourself watching this title over and over to see the memorable moments.",3.0
"First off I just want to say that after all the hype of this movie, I was dissapointed. I think it is a good movie but it did not live up to my expectations or the hype. I do wish that I had rented it before I bought it, but oh well. There is one scene that I liked and that was the scene with The Black Night and he gets all his limbs cut off. I did have to force myself to laugh at this scene and some others, so it wasn't that good. My advice is if you haven't seen it, and you want to see it, see if you can rent it first. If you like it then, by all means buy it. I didn't even like the extras that much except for the English subtitles. I have to have them on when I watch a DVD because the sound is sorta low on my DVD player even if I have the TV sound halfway up to the maximum. I doubt if I watch this anymore for awhile. The most questionable point about this whole thing is at the end and the police officer puts his hand on the screen and it stops. I was very confused about that part and I had to select that scene and watch it again before I understood that that was how it was supposed to end. Boy I tell you what, the British putting the credits at the beginning really mess you up. All in all this is a good movie, but PLEASEEEE rent it before you waste [money] on it.",3.0
"It's an ok story, enough to hold my interest.",3.0

"This is an extremely slow-moving film that has some interesting moments, but that all in all turns out to be disappointing.  It's not a thriller--it's simply a study on how long he can go avoiding detection.  There are some plot elements that stretch one's belief far too much, but they've all been mentioned in other reviews.  The characters, in general, are flat--there's very little depth to any of them.  It ended up being a very long two hours for very little that was enjoyable.",3.0
"I am downgrading my rating of the Special Edition DVD because of the fact that subtitles switch themselves on at scene changes, seriously disrupting the flow of the film.

"Essentially a series of sketches with a medieval theme, this is less structured than 'Life of Brian', and operations on a sillier level  entirely. You've probably seen it half-a-dozen times already, and on DVD  it's just as funny as it is on VHS, but with a slightly nicer picture and a  smaller box. That's pretty much all you get, too - the wonderful Criterion  version of 'Life of Brian' is a taster of what can be done with DVD, and  the lack of extras makes this less interesting. What sets the film itself  apart from the competition (not that there is any) is the attention to  detail, the desire to create a stylish portrayal of medieval England on a  minute budget (less than a quarter of a million dollars, in fact). It works  well - location footage in Scotland and lots and lots of smoke give the  production an 'Exclaibur'-esque look of grim and gritty reality, and this  is what sticks in the mind after the film is over. It's extremely funny,  but you know that already - as with all Python, you can watch it again and  again, spotting lines and performances you hadn't noticed beforehand. Given  that no special effort has been put into the presentation, and given that  'Holy Grail' is hardly THX material anyway, you'd probably be better off  with the standard VHS version. Or tape it from the telly.",3.0

"A very solid, noir-type sci-fi movie from the late 90's. Jude Law and Adam Arkin are my favorites in this one, but Hawke and Thurman are good too. While some of the dialogue is kitsch (mostly stuff given to Uma and Ethan's characters) and the movie clearly reflects 90s aesthetics more than any future or near-future one can imagine, it still is a whole helluva lot better than any of the dreck the playing-it-safe, sequel- and superhero-obsessed Hollywood puts out today. To recontextualize it in modern terms, it's something A24 or Annapurna might put out: the type of well crafted, mid-level indie with a few names that is sadly dying a slow box office death.",3.0

"I saw this movie when it first came out and probably would have given it 4 stars then. It didn't seem as great to me this time around, and not because I'd seen it before--I'd actually forgotten most of the details. I found the story lacking in terms of what exactly was so important about Vincent's flight and what he would be doing ... or maybe I wasn't paying attention? Something about the fraternal tension fell flat. And Jerome's mode of travel at the end: nobody would choose that. I did like the juxtaposition of 1940s-ish design and culture with the space-age stuff.

The excellent takeaway is that genes do not control 100 percent of our destiny. Accidents, willpower, and other factors come into play.

Cast: I'm not a fan of Jude Law, but he is very good here as a wounded soul. Ethan Hawke does okay. Uma Thurman's acting skills were not very well developed at this point. Loren Dean is better than I remembered; what happened to that guy? Fun to see good supporting work from Xander Berkeley, Alan Arkin, and Ernest Borgnine.",3.0

"I was looking for a good sci-fi  movie for my daughter and I to watch...she is 10, and picked this based on reviews.  First off I thought it was fine for children around this age, as many other reviewers have said.  As for the movie itself I thought it was just kind of ""meh.""  Sci-fi has been my obsession, my whole life, and I think in terms of content, dialog, technology, graphics, acting, settings, costume design, theme, premise, etc., it all fell short.

In many aspects it was reflective of Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" albeit a very poorly executed version.  More than anything this is more of a suspenseful thriller/drama, with a touch of sci-fi.",3.0

"I was hoping for a science fiction experience with some good acting...turned out to be a cerebral suspense movie based in the ""not too distant future"".  Uma Thurmond is nice to look at, but this wasn't Ethan Hawke's best performance.  For someone living his dream, albiet with his life always at risk of being discovered, I could not buy into his character.

If you're hoping for some sci-fi action...forget-about-it.  The only action is Ethan and Uma running down a back alley at night.

Believable?  The main premise where society is totally based upon genetic manipulation and the old Eugenics & Nazi ""betterment of the race"" concept is totally believable.  Astronauts going into space in 3-piece suits...not so much.

"This is a clever story that seems like something out of today's news of NSA snooping and genetic tampering via bad science. There's a good deal of suspense to keep the story going, but unfortunately it tends to get mired down in overly-long, uncomfortable situations of well-trimmed, clean-shaved men staring at one another.  Even Uma Thurman, with suit and hair pulled back, appears mannish through most of this film, so you can't escape something of a gay vibe that permeates the story.  The story was clever, though, and the characters convincing..  Maybe just a little less of the naked body scrub sequences.  Ugh.
A spoiler to offer would be that, near the end of the story the final ""swim contest"" of the two brothers seemed entirely contrived.  Would he seriously go on a lengthy, deadly swim prior to flight?  Why not just, ""hey brother, let's just go get a cup of coffee and talk, ok?""  I dunno, some of the story just seemed wonky like that.  It's a clever idea, and hoping the future is nothing like this.  Maybe at airports it will be soon...",3.0

"This movie is full of possibilities when it comes to discussing the human condition, the trap of expectations and the propensity of knowledge to outpace wisdom. In the end, however, it just really didn't move me. The movie set to high a bar with suspension of disbelief for a work that tried so hard to seem authentic and plausible. The main character's efforts to hide his real identity and the idea that Hawk and Law look anything alike, were purely absurd.",3.0

"I watched this movie when it came out, and had a vague recollection of it being a dystopian vision of a possible future, where gene testing is used to segment people by caste. That's all I really remembered of it, along with vague imagery of very pretty, very well dressed people going about their business.

Watching it again recently, my impressions are sort of different. Yes, this vision of the future looks like a sort of futuristic Ralph Lauren commercial. The thing is, this isn't horrifying. It's a welcome relief to the eyes to look at a lot of people who keep fit and dress like they respect themselves. Look around you: I see a lot of loud, shambling wildebeests who make me long for this future well-dressed ""dystopia"" no matter how oppressive it might be. Even the cars are pretty cool looking. Bring it on. Probably, this is intimidating to slobs; I found it invigorating.

Science-wise, we know something about how genetic testing works, and what it can do. No, you will never have testing sniffer thingees or finger blood takers that can instantly sequence an individual: chemistry and physics don't work that way. No, we can't tell to a high degree of probability what people will die of. Genes are statistically important, but environment is pretty important in health outcomes. I have lousy genes for strength training: proven by genetic science (though you could tell looking at me before I started lifting weights). Yet, I'm pretty damn strong. I don't even train real hard. Environment. Sure, some people have grave health defects which can be detected by genetic testing: most people don't. And ... why was the Gattica space camp constantly doing the same damn gene test on everyone, several times a day at work? Also, for a society so obsessed with genetic perfection, why can't they breed people who don't have such glaring cartoon-like character defects?

Speaking of the characters, I have no sympathy for any of them. I know who I'm supposed to identify with: the non-genetic engineered protagonist. He is a selfish sociopathic jerk. He wants to go to outer space. Hey, so do I. I also don't have a life threatening heart condition which could get everyone else in the space ship killed, nor am I functionally blind, which could also get everyone in the space ship killed, since he's training to be a navigator. Finally, despite his bad ticker, he wants to shack up with a girl ... with a bad ticker. Gee, wouldn't it be great to have ""normal"" kids with bad tickers that kill them at 30? What kind of monster is he? The detective: jerk. The protagonist's gene engineered brother: insecure jerk, and a cowardly ninny. The wheelchair bound superman: petulant creepy jerk who has no motivation for any of his actions. Gore Vidal's character: blubber-fey megalomaniacal murderous jerk. Heart-attack girlfriend: paranoid nosey prissy jerk. Maybe the future will be populated by unsympathetic narcissists like in this movie.

"I was unfamilar with this movie, my colleague said we use after our Genetics Unit as a finishing activity.

"Why is this movie listed in the romance category? ""Girl"" is mostly about un-requited love and career aspirations. I felt no love in this move only sexual rejection and polygamous characters. The main characters Andrea Marr and Todd Sparrow from the get-go these two clowns were romantically incompatible thus resulting in un-requited love. A conservative girl tries to date a rocker guy Sparrow--yeah right. The sex scenes were lame. Throwing in cheap sex. Not that slow-boring tender love scenes would have been any better. The unconventional characters were so flawed not that I could relate to the conservative characters any better. Both groups have moral problems to the extreme. Marrs kept lying to fit in.",3.0

"This is one of those films that you are suppose to admire and praise if you are in the artsy film crowd, however there was very little to really like about this work. Don't get me wrong the film was shot, edited and acted all very well, so what was the problem - the story.

First of for anyone who watches or reads a lot of science fiction will know that the premise has been done before so going into this movie one would hope for some sort of creative twists or something to differentiae this work from all of the others. The problem was there were none, and not only was there nothing different the movie never even pretended to try. This made the film so highly formulaic and predictable that it became painfully boring to finish. In fact the only reason I did finish it was to see if I was wrong -would they do something that surprised me and in the end the answer was a boring no.

**** Spoiler Alert****

Let be honest if you are a science fiction fan did any of this take you by surprise or did you expect it.

Vincent was going to succeed? Totally expected
Irene was going to be his love interest? Saw that coming a mile away
Irene was genetically defective? Yawn
Irene would end up covering for Vincent? Of course
Antonio would come back in the picture and try to foil Vincent's goal? My dog saw that one coming
There would be the inevitable second swimming scene? Boring
Director Josef was the murderer? Predictable

"When I first saw Girl, it was at the end and I never saw it from the beginning.  Due to some stroke of luck, I actually got to see it.  I was appalled and intrigued by what I watched.

I was intrigued though because I have always wanted to know what went on behind the scenes of these rock concerts(and no I am not a [...]), because they make these types of movies where the guy sticks with her and she goes wherever he goes.

Although competently made, the film suffers from being overly-preachy -- based (intentionally?) on a misunderstanding of eugenics -- and in itself has a couple of gaping plot holes. Add to that Uma Thurmon's utterly lifeless performance and lack of chemistry with the rest of the cast, and you have a film that has a hint of potential that it fails to live up to.

"This movie is about an 18 year old girl --our heroine named Andrea-- who falls in lust and becomes a groupie for a local rock god, and through her misplaced passion she finds herself. And as entertaining as I found the movie to be, I found the plot highly unlikely and the sub-plots (such as the situations with Cybil, Darcy, and especially Greg) to be treated with little or no reverance.  Andrea is treated by her supporting characters like some goddess when, if you really look at the persona she presents during the flick to her on screen friends and love interests, she isn't all that unique.  I will say that Andrea's thinking process, brought to the viewer through frequent voice overs, brought to light a girl almost completely different than the girl she showed, one witty and fiery and a complete individual. This movie is good for a viewing or two, but it's definately not going to win any awards or rock the world with it's greatness.",3.0
"Dominique Swain is the primary reason to seek out this relatively little-seen film.  Her first movie role, ""Lolita,"" is really  something to see.  She is very natural and charismatic.  Unfortunately,  ""Girl"" isn't up to that standard in any way.  She does what she  can, but the movie is another cliche-ridden teen film.  The supporting cast  makes a great effort, particularly Selma Blair (she must be seen in  ""Cruel Intentions,"" a wonderful comedic performance).  However,  by the end of this film, I found myself wondering why the main character  Andrea was worthy of my attention for 99 minutes.  She doesn't seem to  change or grow significantly, although clearly that was the intention  (i.e., she becomes a woman, not merely a girl, because she stops chasing  after an immature rock singer).
Despite the somewhat poorly told story,  this is a cut above much of the recent teen-flick product.  Besides the  good performances, I give this film some credit for at least attempting to  treat its subject with a degree of seriousness.  As for the DVD, although  not specified here on the amazon.com listing, there is a short 'making-of'  featurette and a commentary track with the director and Dominique Swain.  Fans of Swain take note: she speaks very infrequently during the film.  Still, these features are nice to have and do add to the value of the disc.",3.0

"The 1980's were an era that mass produced more... screwball comedies than ever before. It was also the era that movies filled with mega-violence were made and cloned more quickly than mulitpling mosquitoes.[I thought] one of these such films was BLUE THUNDER.

BLUE THUNDER has all the elements of many of those violent 1980s films. The lead character is a Vietnam vet struggling with vivid flashbacks. He has a comical sidekick (in this case played by Daniel Sterns) who is murdered about halfway through the picture. The lead character ends up getting caught up in a plot that runs deeper than he originally imagined that ends up leading all the way to some secret government sector or plot. In the end the hero takes things into his own hands and goes on a rampage to get the bad guys and set things right and is cleared of all wrong doing, accused or actual.

Roy Scheider stars in the film as L.A.P.D. aero-division pilot Frank Murphy. Schneider does a decent job considered the material he was given. Besides one feels an immediate kinship to anything Scheider acts in; this is the guy that killed Jaws. His sidekick in the film is a young Daniel Sterns (before he gained fame with ""The Wonder Years"" and HOME ALONE) and he does a good job playing the greenhorn.

However, neither Scheider or Sterns is the star of this movie. They are both second billing to a super-duper armed police helicopter called (you guessed it), BLUE THUNDER. You see Blue Thunder was created by the government to keep us rebellious citizens in line and to protect people at the 1984 Olympic Games in L.A. However, some really evil guys planned to use the machine for alternative purposes to help ""keep order"" (hint, hint). This chopter has armor, can sense heat, shoots a lot of bullets really fast, and can hear and see through walls. She's the star.

Overall, the movie's not all that good or bad. The movie starts off slow but picks up after the first half hour racing steam until the exploding, yet let down of a conclusion.",3.0
"Have you ever wondered what life would be like if...it was the future? All books were burned? Aliens invaded? Then you've probably turned to sci-fi to live out your dystopian (or utopian) fantasies. So in the never-ending quest for the right drug, take the blue pill. Blue Thunder, that is. Blue Thunder explores all possible options for expostion. Such a revisionist history usually attempts to redefine science fiction in film-specific terms, opting variously for epistemologically based or image-based criteria instead of the source-based or narrative-based assumptions that have so far shaped most discussions of SF film. Not so with Ol' Blue Thunder. Central to the genius of this film is the reconsideration of the question of whether cinemato graphic aspects of film production could themselves mark film as science fictional or provide in themselves phenomena worthy of consideration by the SF community--the spectacle of production technology deserving and rewarding our attention just as surely as do narratives about the impact of technology. And the SF community would have a lot better things to talk about than cinemato graphic aspects if they did the wild thing more often, instead of drooling over Captain Kirk's tush in Star Trek! The fleeting colaboration of brilliant thespian (Rob Schneider) and brilliant director (John Badham), combined with the building blocks of life known as craft service (oh yeah, and let's not forget the writers!) made one tour de force without the tour or the force, so I guess this film is just made of ""de"" (get it?) So what are you doing still reading this review? Go out and rent it!",3.0
"One hates to get caught agreeing with such insufferably elitist movie critics like Pauline Kael and Leonard Maltin, but their misgivings about the movie Blue Thunder are fairly accurate.  Kael goes too far in calling the film ""Suspense In A Void,"" for its implied argument that the film skimps over characters and plot is unfair.  The film establishes good audience involvement with the characters, helped by the fine performances of Roy Scheider, Daniel Stern, and Malcolm McDowell.
The main draw, of course, is the helicopter, a French-built gunship, reminscent of the AH-64 Apaches featured in Firebirds, but sporting a Gatling cannon with a fire-rate of 4,000 rounds per minute, and high-tech surveillance cameras and microphones.  The ship's lethality is demonstrated in a terrific test run by the Army for LAPD brass; the ship blasts away at cardboard dummies representing terrorists and civilians within a mockup of a city block.  The film pointedly highlights civilian dummies getting blasted; the audience thus forgets that, given the hopeless interminging of terrorists amid civilians, the gunship's ability to pick out the right targets comes through as well as can be honestly expected.  It all closes out with a delightfully explosive strafing run of a bus manned by terrorists.
Frank Murphy (Scheider) is assigned to test Blue Thunder over LA, this over the trepidation of old Army foe Colonel F.E. Cochrane (McDowell).  Murphy and his copilot Richard Lymangood (Stern) test the ship's surveillance capability in hilarious fashion when they stare down the cleavage of a waitress and then listen in on a CHP cop (nicknamed Double Dork by Murphy) in bed with another man's wife.  But then they get wind of the real reason for the chopper's existence when they follow Cochrane to the city's federal building and record a conversation between Cochrane, other members of the Blue Thunder project, and several government types; they've been instigating rioting in LA's barrios to justify bringing out Blue Thunder in a program called Project THOR.  It is a plot that lacks even a minor level of believability or plausibility.
The action scenes and cast are good, but the absurdity of the plot ultimately hurts the film.  Nonetheless, the visuals are worth a look.",3.0
"Director:  Andrew Niccol

Cast:  Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, Jude Law, Gore Vidal, Xander Berkeley, Jayne Brook, Elias Koteas.

Running Time:  106 minutes

Rated PG-13 for brief violent images, language, and some sexuality.

""Gattaca"" is intended as a cautionary tale about genetic engineering. The film takes place in a future world, not too far removed, where destiny is determined by genes: all babies (except for a few ""accidents,"" known as ""invalids"") are genetically engineered to near-perfection, people are hired on the basis of their genetic profile, and the imperfect products of accidental births are relegated to low-status menial jobs. Our hero, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), is an ""invalid"" who wants to rise above his genetic destiny. So, in an elaborate scheme, he buys the identity of Eugene Morrow, a genetically perfect athlete crippled in an accident, and gets the job he always dreamed about in a space-exploration program.  When the director of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation is murdered; however, investigations into the crime put into question Vincent's true identity, and he soon finds that his long deception could be unraveled and his life-long dream could be shot down in flames. With only fellow colleague Irene (Uma Thurman) and Jerome on his side, Vincent must race against the powers that are trying to put him back into the social hole he was supposedly born into and put an end to the life he has worked so hard to build.

The film has a very sorrowful approach to what sounds initially like a very lame plot. It's cinematic and stylistic without being pretentious or overdone, and the way it is shot and put together reflects very well the film's bland and sterilized society in pursuit of perfection. The chilling sense of realism that goes with the world of Gattaca makes everything within it become more than just a strange concept in a science fiction film. Not unlike Spielberg's 'A.I.', Gattaca very cleverly draws from horrors within our society today to suggest the terrifying prospect that our science will eventually render us, as a natural species, obsolete.  Director Andrew Niccol (""Lord of War"") has done a fine job in transforming this sci-fi flick into something much deeper and more interesting. The writing is not spectacular, but is still better than most. Hawke's narration provides very good atmosphere for the film as he talks about the way of the world in this eerie future and the film's theme is very secure, with events such as the murder being practically irrelevant. The thing that matters most is Vincent's dream and the social inequalities that prevent him from actualizing it, and this is made very clear from beginning to end.  The acting performances are all very adequate, but the stand-out ones are Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, who seem so comfortable in their characters and, truth be told, share more chemistry than Hawke and Thurman do. This was one of Jude Law's first feature films, and it is a remarkably impressive debut.  Basically, this is a film that says what it means. Even in a world that has successfully bred perfection, people still suffer, the system is still unjust and lives still go to waste. Far from just being an unrealistic portrayal of what the future will hold, 'Gattaca' questions the ideals of mankind, the principles of civilization and leaves us to wonder what we, as a society are truly striving for.",3.0
"This is a chilling look into what could be, our society's future. This movie, has a good story, with some true, sad, deepness.

The story goes, in the future, your life is molded around, your genes and how you were born. The natural born people (""In-valids"") and the genetically modified people (""valids"") are seperated into different classes, and different realms of life.

A young in-valid, Vincent(Ethan Hawke) has a dream to become an astronaut, despite, all the things holding him back, like his DNA for one thing. After, seeing no easy way to achieve his dream, he starts to try a different tactic. He takes the identiy, of a perfect valid, Jerome (Jude Law) that has been crippled in an accident, and now has no real future. Instead, of his perfect genes going to waste, he is used to help Vincent, achieve his goal. The real Jerome supplies the now Jerome with everything he needs to pretend to be him, from blood, to urine. Soon, Vincent now Jerome, works his way up the ranks, in a futuristic, space agency like thing, (Gattaca) and soon is a step away from his dream, when a murder case comes up at Gattaca, and threatens to ruin his whole plan. But, during all this, Vincent, falls in love with an in-valid working at Gattaca, (Uma Thurman)and she soon becomes caught up in his plan.

This is a very interesting, deep, sad, and smart story. It is a very beiliveable sci-fi movie. It shows, how humans did not only become more advanced in technology, but in the way they discrimminate. I found, it a very good movie, but heart-breaking in alot of ways. I only hope, society and science never get this advanced, it's for our own good. The ending is what set my rateing back, becasue I'm to emoitional a person not acknowledge the sad aspect, of the ending. I recomend this to any sci-fi nerd, and people who enjoy a good suspense, and story that really makes you think.",3.0
"For some odd reason, the 1980s was the decade for the ""character machine,"" where audiences became engrossed in the capability and technology of a vehicle almost to the point of the vehicle becoming a major star or protagonist in the film. Blue Thunder is in my opinion the epitome of this phenomenon, along with The General Lee (Dukes of Hazard), Airwolf, Street Hawk, Firefox, KITT (Knight Rider), Back to the Future's DeLorean DMC-12, Time Rider, and to a lesser extent, B.A. Baracas' van (""The A-Team"") and the Ferraris of Magnum PI and Miami Vice. Blue Thunder is an action flick at its core, with some plot holes and over the top stunt work, but contextualized properly, is a fun film. Very few models were employed to make the film (yes, Blue Thunder was a fully functional flying modified A&eacute;rospatiale Gazelle), and the blue screening effect to make it seem like Roy Scheider is actually piloting the chopper is surprisingly good. If you see this film, do so with the understanding that it wasn't about character development, acting, etc. but it was a stunt film for stunt fans. And for 1983 the stunts are pretty good. Go for the Blu-ray, not the DVD, as the cleanup of the original on Blu-ray is noteworthy.",3.0
"""Gattaca"" is a more than usually intelligent sci-fi film that isn't quite done justice by its uneven script. The film obviously pays a debt to Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" but ""Gattaca"" actually creates a somewhat more realistic vision of a future society than does Huxley's book. Here, parents are able to genetically engineer their children into perfection from birth, and while genetic discrimination is not legal, the process results in those with superior genes having available to them advantages that do not befall the genetic inferiors.

As long as the script sticks to the pseduo-thriller plot that finds Ethan Hawke buying the genetic identity of Jude Law and then trying to cover up his fraud, the film is fairly engrossing. However, a story line involving sibling rivalry is handled very awkwardly and threatens to derail the picture about three-quarters of the way through, and a love story feels obligatory and only half-way developed. Still, the production design is stunning and almost worth sitting through just for

its own sake, and a mostly engaging plot makes for a pretty

entertaining film.

Grade: B",3.0
"I think it's a interesting actual subject, which makes you think about man and his nature. When the science is badly used, it could be wrong for humanity and also dangerous for the future. This movie talks about discrimination and it shows the world could be better without the differents between ""valid""(is a perfect person) and ""invalid""(is a person who has got a problem) human beings. My moral for this movie is ""If you want, you can do it"" because Gattaca talks about Willpower.",3.0
"I like this film because, i think the story is very good. I like the part of the film where Jerome swims whith his brother as far as they can and the loser is the one who is scared,[...].

"The world of this movie was never meant for one as deficient genetically as this Vincent, we are given to understand. In this nearish future, genetic design is depicted as at least a frequent occurrence, perhaps even the norm. Vincent was conceived normally and brings into the world a daunting catalogue of infirmities, summed up in a life-expectancy of 30 years, low by even the standards of certain far eastern countries today. This does not sit well with his consuming ambition to travel into space, and the film builds a collection of different plots and sub-plots around this basic quandary.

To start with what is particularly good about Gattaca, the sets are striking. They create a `futuristic' aura very successfully, so much so that they they actually forced my attention on to what I believe to be one aspect of the film's main weakness, namely the plot or plots - Vincent's basic dilemma does not require a future setting at all. If he had been a weakling trying to get into a career in, say, sport or the armed services in 2004 that would have dealt with the issue just as well. The other thing that is distinctly good, in a certain kind of way, is the acting. When Gore Vidal, of all people, makes an early entrance in the role of Director, I reflected momentarily that I had never seen him acting before. In an instant I had corrected myself - I have never seen Vidal not acting. He acts a persona of his own creating whenever he appears on the media, and it is no surprise that he carries off his film role so convincingly. The Director is a far simpler personality that the real-life Gore Vidal. The three main roles are taken by Ethan Hawke as Vincent, Jude Law as the crippled but genetically perfect Jerome, and Uma Thurman as Irene. Like the Director, the characters are schematic and line-drawn, and such as they are they are very well done. The trouble, I hate to say, is the plotting.

Not only is the basic setting not really required, the theme of Vincent's physical frailty actually has nothing to do with the ethical question of designer-vs-natural conception either. These threads are separate strands thrown into a single bag, so to speak, but not woven together. In much the same way the murder investigation, which threatens to blow Vincent's cover and reveal his clever DNA exchange with Jerome, is very loosely integrated with the main action - anything of that kind would have taken only the smallest mischance to come to light, and the efforts of the investigators make the quest for certain weapons in Iraq even as I write look a model of competence. It all left me not even needing to make a willing supension of disbelief at how an impoverished janitor obtained the funds first to pay the rapacious clandestine transgenetics operator and second to pay his way though the Gattaca induction programme. To cap it all, there is a further sub-plot of sibling rivalry between Vincent and his eugenic younger brother Anton, which must be important, I have to assume, as one of their periodic swimming contests takes place at the climactic stage of the story. And of course there is a love-theme as well, in case the film ran out of themes.

I suppose this could hardly be called a rave-notice, and I fully admit that the film at least held my attention. It is not a bad film by any means, but the nearer in time to us that such an action is supposed to take place the harder it is to keep one's normal rational faculties switched off.",3.0
"I think this movie is slightly overrated. The acting is not bad, camerawork not bad, but it's not excellent either. The dialogs are not really realistic -too many functional dialogs- and most characters are quite 'flat'. Don't understand me wrong, it's not a bad movie, but it's moralistic undertone probably caused it to become slightly overrated (just like movies like American History X).",3.0

"I bought ""Gattaca"" after seeing the excerpt from what turns out to be the start of the movie, in PBS's ""Nova"" program.  Folks design their offspring and get the USDA seal of approval on their genetic sequence.  Thus is the entrance to the great machine of identification and authentication made, and the outsiders are simply not ""valid"".  I guess I could live with less of the sensational action and further elaboration on the science, but then I'm an admitted geek from the get-go.  The aura of this film is very much like what we saw in the screen version of ""Fahrenheit 451""; that of a world you know has gone nuts, with some obsession that is supposed to be the end all for public safety and social harmony.  Folks will wind up, in the world of ""Gattaca"", with an identification about as impersonal as an ear-tag appended to a factory-farmed meat animal, but a lot more telling.  I shudder to imagine that the much-maligned delusions behind eugenics, made so popular earlier in the last century, will create such a bunch of cretins as the two fellows who conspire to fool...not mother nature, but Big Brother himself.  One really has to wonder, in all of this, which is the better cause--one's comfort or one's innate conscience.  ""Gattaca"" works the best it can with its premise, only by the time it gets fully laid down, we're just dealing with another story of a fugitive for whom we're supposed to cheer.  There are steep and awesome precipices in the idea of genetic authentication, and the movie gives us some idea of them.  But is not evolution just like that, and equally dramatic?  It would seem that we're enacting our own set of challanges, then sending out intentional mutations that are supposed to win.  Yes, this is all suggested, but what we principally have is an attempt at a cliffhanger flight.  The subject matter of our protagonists' interpretation of propriety, however, is just another struggle of the freedom-fighter ilk.  It is a little too focused on the lead characters, leaving a lot left to do with a very profound topic.  It would seem, in the human intervention at hand, that ontogeny truly recapitulates philogeny, only the ontology is hardly able to account for the impossible number of original interventions that took place during the philology.  Wherever a crime is comitted, evidence remains.  I would have liked to have seen a better treatment of the ultimate crime behind this society's proclamation of what is good and what is not.",3.0
"Discrimination, nature-vs.-nuture, potential, drive... all fascinating issues, and all touched upon by Gattaca.
But when paired with a 'stylishly soulless' execution, the issues become as dull and lifeless as the characters that portray them.
In the film, love fizzles rather than sizzles.  Passion seems hardly passionate.  The main character has drive, but it's one more exposited than shone.
All of this together makes one think ""hmm"" rather than ""wow!""  While this may be a ""thinking man's movie"" it succeeds only in suggesting broad themes to contemplate rather than coloring, twisting, accentuating, and tweaking aspects of the themes to get us to take the next step.
And on a more superficial but no less frustrating level, I found it questionable that a firm like Gattaca would require DNA testing -- whether for identity or drug-free status verification -- on such a frequent basis.  With entrance into the facility already tightly controlled, what threat (post-murder environment aside) was so imminent that justified such a thwart in daily productivity?
SPOILER!!!

And lastly, with regards to the murder... surely, some of the murderer's stature and access could have employed a much less blunt method of killing, no?  Poisoning, sniper rifle (via hitman), etc... all would have resulted in less risk of ultimate detection.
In a nutshell, then, Gattaca -- despite its noble trajectory -- is brought down by implausibility and a failure to examine critical issues raised in a more bold and deep manner.",3.0
"Great movie, but if I had to do it over again I'd skip the superbit edition.
My eyes aren't sophisticated enough to see much difference in quality between regular DVD and superbit. Yet the superbit takes up so much space on the disk there's no room left for those 'extras' we all love, like commentaries etc. It's just the film.
This, by the way, is what I call a ""real"" science fiction film; that is, it has a plausible plotline based on real science, rather than ""space opera"" like Star Wars or pop schlock like ""ET"" and ""Close Encounters.""",3.0
"I've always had very mixed feelings about Blue Thunder.  On the plus side it features it features one of the last big budget Hollywood leading roles for the perennially under-appreciated Roy Scheider plus wonderful supporting turns by Warren Oats as his exasperated boss and Candy Clark as his flaky but brave girlfriend and a hissable villain in Malcolm MdDowell.  The movie is fast paced and sometimes exciting and is slickly directed by the underrated John Badham.

So what's the problem?

Blue Thunder just has so many things in it that don't ring true it can be frustrating to watch unless you are dumb or willing to turn your brain completely off.  First of all the plot involves a conspiracy by shady government officials and firearms manufacturers to create phony crime to justify the police buying the helicopter of the title--but it's pretty hard to imagine any scenario where a city would allow a heavily armed military chopper that can take out whole city blocks at a time to be used by the police.  Then there's the question of how the very British Malcolm McDowell who never attempts an American accent became a colonel in the US military.  Or how the US military is getting involved with domestic policing even though that is illegal.  Or why the chief assassin for the arms merchants drives around in a beater without any plates that makes him look extremely out of place in all of the upscale areas where he happens to be plying his trade in the movie.

The sequence where Roy Scheider outsmarts two F-16's and their heat seeking missiles is fun but, realistically, a lot of innocent people likely died as a result of Roy Scheider's evasive maneuvers since this is all happening in the middle of the day when the buildings would be full of people.  The script is co-written by the normally reliable Dan O'Bannon (Alien; Dead and Buried; Return of the Living Dead; Total Recall) so it's hard to understand why Blue Thunder is frequently so dumb.

In the end Blue Thunder isn't a 1980's action classic in the same league as Die Hard or Robocop or Predator or The Terminator because there are way too many obvious and fixable problems with the script--but on balance it's probably more good than bad and qualifies as reasonably good mindless entertainment, basically a slicker and much more expensive version of the entertaining but dopey schlock that Cannon was churning out.  The frustrating thing is that Blue Thunder could have been excellent if someone had bothered to rewrite the script.",3.0
"The accompaning write up mentioned Special Features, apart from the movie, one of the main reasons for purchasing. It contained only the movie so from that aspect very dissappointing..",3.0
"As with too many other SuperBit editions, this one
simply dumped the special features (documentary
featurette in this case) present on the original edition.
I'm not sure when this studio's going to clue in that
the main reason people buy DVD over VHS is
extra features.  Maybe they are starting to understand
this, as both The Patriot and Hollow Man [why? it was a total waste of film...] have been issued as ""SuperBit Deluxe"" editions with an extra disc containing the special features that were on the original ""NormalBit"" release.  So why not this treatment with Gattaca?  I'll stick to my original version, thanks.  Barely perceptable increase in video quality simply isn't enough of a draw to dump the documentary extras.",3.0

"Gattaca explores one of the neglected dangers of cloning. While eugenics would actually populate the world with largely benign and perfectly healthy and intelligent people, society would have to become more sophisticated to match those who populate its upper levels.  Those who don't meet the standards of the society in ""Gattaca"" would fall through its cracks, creating a sort of techno-apartheid, bigotry right down to a science.  Ethan Hawke is one of those unlucky 'godchildren' ' born into a sterile future from natural and not in-vitro fertilization. Talk about being born under a bad sign, a post-natal DNA check confirms that Hawke's character will have cardiac, neurological and vision problems and will be unlikely to live past his 30's. (Hawke's father, in an understated but heartbreaking moment, stops the doctors from letting the poor boy become his namesake). Fruitlessly dreaming of becoming an astronaut for the vaunted Gattaca, Vincent ('Hawke's character's eventual name) is confronted with a cruel reality of being 'invalid' ' one of the lower castes reserved for those of bad genes. (To maintain the genetic-ghetto, the police routinely test DNA make-up based on hair, fingernails, dandruff, blood and urine analyses of suspects.) The only spaceships Vincent has any hope of seeing the inside of are the ones he cleans as a janitor. Desperate, Vincent enters the identity black-market, an underworld where Valids on hard times sell their DNA perfect ID's to upwardly mobile invalids. To counter the police, these 'identity-smugglers' provide the tools that will allow Vincent to match up with Jerome Eugene Morrow, a valid crippled in an accident and reduced to wheelchair-bound and alcohol-fueled self-pity. Vincent has an ambitious plan ' using Jerome's identity, he will re-enter Gattaca (he had once mopped floors there) and become an astronaut. Despite his humble beginnings, Vincent has his fraud well-mapped: he excels as a navigator-trainee and is chosen for an eagerly awaited mission to the moons of Saturn. He takes his fraud very seriously ' careful to leave bits of Jerome's stubble and nail clippings at his work station. At first, everything works out ' not even the coldly analytical director of Gattaca (Gore Vidal) nor an even colder fellow-trainee (Uma Thurman) with whom Vincent falls in love suspect that he is really an invalid. With less than three weeks to the mission, disaster strikes ' one of Gattaca's directors is found dead, murdered and somebody is not only responsible, but has inadvertently left some physical debris behind. The only clue the police have are bits of skin fragments traced to Vincent ' but as far as anybody knows, Vincent hasn't worked in Gattaca in years, and nobody can immediately connect him and Jerome. However, a persistent detective with his own interest in the case throws a tight cordon around Gattaca, convinced that Vincent is hiding among the Valids, hoping to ferret Vincent out. Determined to go into space, Vincent uses every trick he can to stay ahead of the police.
This was a great idea for a movie, which is why it loses something in the translation ' Hawke is excellent as the genetically imperfect 'invalid' who uses his desperation to surpasses expectations, but once he becomes Jerome, his story boils down to the tricks he uses to elude detection. The script does little with possibility that Vincent, though it's unfair, really has no place in the advanced society. Uma Thurman is too cold to match Hawke as his love interest. Instead, the script pairs up Jude Law as the 'Valid' who rents DNA to Hawke. At first it's a business proposition ' Vincent's wages can help the drunken Jerome maintain a semblance of his standard of living. Further down, Jerome finds a more symbiotic basis for their relationship.  With the crippled Eugene officially holding a position with the vaunted Gattaca, he can face down anybody who would have dismissed him. Unfortunately, Jerome becomes more self absorbed, undermining what should be a climactic moment in which the wheelchair-bound Jerome must pose as his physically-whole self. What really kills this flick is its vision of a future as if conceived by the guys who do the artwork for Esquire ' with this new age looking like a sedate version of the swinging '60's, complete with electric-versions of period cars, steel and wood architecure, and a cooly non-techno version of just about everything. (Alan Arkin's character, a detective, looks as if he's walked off an episode of 'Naked City'; astronauts fly into space while wearing Armani suits) It's stylish, but the style overwhelms the substance. A botch, but not one you should resist.",3.0

Was surprised that the movie showed up unopened (was expecting as it was advertised as new), but everything was also written in French and the box noted that it was from Canada (this was the surprise as it was not noted in the advertisement).

"Blue Thunder, 1983 film

They show police helicopters flying. Men gather for their assignment. Is this a good assignment? They report for a 211 in progress and follow the robber with a searchlight. A helicopter's blades create a downdraft. They spot an abandoned vehicle. This is an unusual attraction at night. ""How does she bend like that?"" A radio call takes them away. There are shots and suspects fall; they call for an ambulance. Their manage has complaints; they are grounded. Frank's driving tells of his attitude. His girlfriend visits. The TV reports the death of a politician. Frank Murphy is suspended. Two Federal agents tell of a new helicopter that will be tested (the Olympic Games will be held in Los Angeles). It has anti-terrorist capabilities. [Is that legal?] Its 20 mm rapid fire machine gun does tremendous damage (with collateral casualties).

Frank will do the test flight. His helicopter develops engine trouble and crashes! [Sabotage?] Driving down a one-way street the wrong way? Does Frank have memory flashbacks to Vietnam? [Note the personal conflicts added for drama.] Frank is warned about his comments to that Colonel. He flies the helicopter at night. The computer can research names, and he overhears a conversation about the shooting of a Commissioner. Is Murphy a threat? ""Take him out."" Captain Braddock grounds him again. His copilot Lyman is attacked at home and tortured so he'll give up that tape! Can he escape? Who will be blamed? Murphy listens to a telephone message from Lyman. Who will he call? He calls his girlfriend to pick up that tape hidden at a drive-in theater. A police car shows up but she gets away. [A chase for action.] Two police helicopters fly near, then have to land!

The helicopters fly along a river bed, one helicopter has to land. Frank's girlfriend is stopped. Can she get away? Will police property be destroyed? The TV station broadcasts the live news. Will F-16s be sent to shoot down the helicopter? Yes. One heat-seeking missile goes astray, so does the next one! But a small helicopter succeeds in shooting Murphy's ship. The TV station plays that tape and learns who is stirring up trouble! Who benefits from a riot that can be suppressed with military force? [Don't they ever run short of ammunition or fuel?] The pursuit helicopter is forced down. ""Catch you later."" A freight train demolishes that helicopter. The death of that Commissioner is reopened due to this new evidence. [Where will it lead?]

There are better action films. This depends too much on a mechanical item to its story. The personal conflicts between a municipal employee and Federal agents seem too contrived for me. It does provide a warning against Federal involvement with civilian authorities. Was this based on some policy in the 1980s? In 1867 the Supreme Court banned military involvement (martial law) in municipal affairs when there was no rebellion.",3.0
"I remember watching this movie a quarter of a century ago and marveled at how incredibly futuristic the Blue Thunder helicopter was, convinced it had to be the work of super talented special effects people. Some time later, I learned it was an actual US military helicopter that was used and that got me even more excited because I had thought it could do all the things depicted in the movie. I mean, silent mode and turbine boost? So realistically done too. Now, I just chuckle at how foolish I was having watched the movie again. Naturally, it wasn't quite as fun as when I watched it many years ago, still, it had some pretty nifty aerial combat sequences featuring some very low flying urban chase scenes and special effects that were way too good for its time. I would have given this movie 5 stars back then but only 3 today. Definitely worth watching if you like helicopters the slightest bit.",3.0
"What can you expect. It was the 80s. 300 bullets can't kill the hero, but only one can take out the bad guy. Who heard of a police chase with a Vega? PLEASE!",3.0
"I really liked this movie when I first saw it, years ago. Watching it again now, I have to shake my head in rueful astonishment.

There's a shocking scene in the TV series ""Mad Men"" where a '60s family pack up after a picnic and simply dump all their trash out on a beautiful green lawn. Times change, huh?

I thought about that when our hero Frank Murphy, a police helicopter pilot played by Roy Scheider, saved himself by tricking the bad guys into firing missiles into a crowded barbecue joint and a high-rise office tower, and again when he shot up a civilian apartment building while trying to take aim on a bad guy in another chopper. This was particularly grating since Murphy had earlier spoken against the bad guys' low regard for civilian lives.

Forget the characters. Forget the plot. They will only annoy you. This movie is stunt porn, pure and simple, and given that it was made before the era of computerized special effects, we have to respect the ingenuity, skill and courage of Hollywood stunt people.

The movie is dumb, but entertaining. Lots of stuff gets blowed up real good, and helicopters are cooool. If you want more than that, you'll want to look elsewhere.",3.0
"Wolverine from the X-men. The Fonz from Happy Days. Han Solo from Star Wars. Spock from Star Trek. Ayukawa Madoka from Kimagure orenji rdo. Even Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet. These characters all have several things in common. 1) They are all very Cool, 2) All were supporting characters (as opposed to the stars) of their particular story, 3) All were the only Cool characters in their story.
Number three is the thing that really made them work. It is a proven fact that people like ""the cool character"" and so many times a writer of a book or a movie or a television show or even professional wrestling tries to make all the characters ""cool."" But when every character is a cold, stoic, cigarette smoking SOB with a killer instinct, the effect is diminished. This is the major problem with the movie Gattaca.
One could theorize that Writer/Director Andrew Niccol was trying to make a statement about the loss of humanity that occurs in a world built on gene-gineered perfection. But if this is the case, then the metaphor never really materializes. Instead we have a film where all the characters are so cool... so intense... that it is hard to actually identify with any of them. Again, it could be argued that this is intentional, but somehow, I feel as though my inability to truly identify with Ethan Hawke's Vincent character removes something from my enjoyment of the film.
That said, I must admit that I did enjoy Gattaca. For starters, the film is simply breathtakingly beautiful. Furthermore, the concept behind the film is very ambitious and Niccol exploration of the idea is very concise and complete. The ideas generated by the questions this movie asks can provide the viewer with philosophical musings for the rest of the evening.
The lead actors, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman (not to mention supporting actors Jude Law and Loren Dean) provide no shortage of eye-candy for male of female viewers. One cannot find a fault in Hawke's acting in this film (or Thurman's to be fair) so much as with the characters they were portraying.
The tragedy of this film is that there could have been a beautiful love story here. But the characters are so cold that it is hard to see why Irene (Thurman) and Vincent (Hawke) would fall for each other at all. The only truly attractive quality either displays is unbelievable drive.
Despite its faults, this film is still somewhat recommended. The cinematography is excellent and the ideas presented are so insightful that I can look past the faults of the movie enough to give it 3 stars.",3.0
"This film is well produced and well-acted, but has virtually no sci-fi elements in it. The ethical and social arguments are valid ( no pun intended ) but I was dissapointed in its lack of action, lack of sci-fi imagery and morose backround music. At times it is little more than a detective story, or a human interest drama. The film needed more excitement and much more creative imagery. Setting is given the back seat and there was no reason for that. What could have been a grand film is only average, though well acted.",3.0
"Unlike many reviewers, I was disappointed in this film.  The film's central myth is the struggle of the individual human will against a Procrustean, deterministic society, which has been one of the most popular myths in Western literature for the past five thousand years.  To be successful, a treatment must add something to this myth.  Other than the wrinkle on genetic engineering, which is old hat in SF, Gattaca adds very little.
The film is stylish, to be sure.  This sometimes works and sometimes does not.  The idea that astronauts will wear business suits when strapped into acceleration couches strains credulity at best.  The acting is mostly competent but is directed to be so utterly flat in affect that one wonders why anybody in this future society would care about anything.  The exposition is constructed mostly of cliches and is predictable from beginning to end.  One of the cliches, a bone-clever gumshoe played wonderfully by Alan Arkin, provides a good contrast but seems entirely out of place--would such a society even permit people like this to occupy positions of authority?
Gattaca is a film that shows promise for a new director, but it doesn't quite make it.",3.0
"I found it fitting that ""Firefox"" is recommended to accompany this film.  But there are differences.  An equally fitting choice to go along with this would be ""War Games"", which came out the same year and shared John Badham as the director.  What this and ""War Games"" have in common and don't have in common with ""Firefox"" or this reviewer is a distrust of our government.

There are other things I didn't like about ""Blue Thunder"".  It had unnecessary R-rated language.  It had some sensuality that may entertain some, but it did not help me relate to or root for the characters.

I will say that it did include Roy Sheider, who has always been one of my favorite actors.  Additionally, it introduced me to Daniel Stern, who I liked better in the ""Home Alone"" movies.  Furthermore, it was an exciting thriller, with good (though sometimes improbable) action.

I'll close by commenting that it may be Badham saw or read ""Firefox"", and liked the concept of a super flying machine, but not liking the Russians being the bad guys, and remade the story to be more sleazy and to make the U.S. the villains.  Too bad.",3.0

"This Special Edition turned out to be not so special after all. Okay, the new transfer is better looking than the previous release. But the movie itself remains the same old version, missing a good bit of the car chase which, for some reason, was included in European copies but was never shown in the US.

The missing part - check it out on imdb - takes place when Roy Scheider's wife, rushing to the TV studio with the tape, drives into a back alley with patrol cars on her tail: there, she skids into a wall on two wheels, bangs the roof of her car, then resumes her crazy run as the patrol cars slam into each other - and this is what makes Scheider wince from his chopper above.

Apart from leaving aside a nice piece of stunt work, this cut also accounts for a continuity loophole, when we see the car drive into the TV studio parking lot with a badly battered rooftop.

Granted, this missing part is no big deal, but it certainly makes this so-called 'Special Edition' a bit of a disappointment.

Five stars for the movie, three for the DVD.",3.0
"Overall, it was good to see the documentaries and how it was done (filming) back in the day but I was hoping for a more detailed view of how blue thunder was constructed and more footage of flight tests and so on. Maybe some interviews with the engineers and pilots would have helped it. It was also very annoying how the director makes the mistake of confusing the Gazelle helicopter with the inferior Aluoette. You would think the director of the best helicopter movie would know better.",3.0

Only Roy Sheider can save the day by hanging off a flagpole on the side of a building and firing a rifle at Blue Thunder's gas tank, causing the shark to explode and then Sheriff Brody has to swim back to shore with a guy who has been ""counting money all [his] life"".  Something like that.  Blue Thunder had slightly less appeal than the hit tv series ""Airwolf"" (starring critically acclaimed alcoholic wife-beater, Jan Michael Vincent).  As the film moves toward the end, you will look back and realize that the woman getting naked in the first 15 minutes of the movie was the best part ... and you will want to rewind it and watch that part again.  If Popeye, Iron Eagle, and Red Dawn are in your movie collection, you may as well round it off and purchase Blue Thunder as well.",3.0
"Educating Rita is a kick, with a wonderful performance from Julie Walters at its heart. Michael Caine, too, is perfectly cast as a poet long since turned to the bottle. Watching those two play off of one another is good  fun; they breathe life into the pat writing. When the story wanders out to  follow either character out in the world, the minor characters are much  less well rounded. (She has a loutish cockney husband and family, he has  intellectual friends who bring wine to parties. Surprised?)
If you  understand the basic outline of the plot here -- cockney young woman trying  to raise herself in charmingly spirited fashion, professor in his cups who  finds the upstart refreshing -- you aren't going to be surprised by where  the story goes. Educating Rita does handle all the likely turns with grace,  though, and that lets you concentrate on appreciating the acting.  The  movie's very watchable and has a good heart.",3.0
"Michael Caine and Julie Walters star in this story of a woman who wants to learn more and change her social status, and the drunken professor who tutors her. That sounds like Pygmalion or My Fair Lady with sexual tension  added, but this film proves a refreshing change, as Rita sets out to  improve both herself and the habits of Frank, her professor. Walters is  wonderful as Rita, reprising her role from the original play, and Caine is  equally good.",3.0
"Released in 1983 and directed by Lewis Gilbert from Willy Russells script, Educating Rita is a drama starring Julie Walters in the titular role as a spirited 26 year-old blue-collar woman from Liverpool, England, who wants to improve her life by enrolling in a special Open University class. She meets with her jaded tutor, Professor Frank (Michael Caine), once a week to study great literature. The morose Frank spends his days in a boozy haze and is intrigued by the outspoken Rita as the mentee lights a fire in the mentor thats been out for a long time.

The plot was taken from George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion (1913), which was the basis for the 1956 Broadway play My Fair Lady, which was in turn made into the famous 1964 movie of the same name. In Roman mythology Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with an ivory statue of a beautiful woman he had carved. Thats fitting for Educating Rita.

I generally enjoyed this drama for several reasons. For instance, I appreciate the locations (Dublin, Ireland, standing in for Liverpool) and the theme: Rita's preconceptions that those in academia lead superior, happier lives are challenged by Frank's failing relationships and pathetic alcoholism, not to mention her cultured flat mate's struggles with severe depression(Maureen Lipman). Despite this, Rita seems to become a stronger person as she learns and adapts to academia.

Unfortunately, the movies lacking in some ways. For one, while Walters is fine in the eponymous role, she was 32 during filming and looked about 35 (her character is supposed to be 26 when introduced). More importantly, the drama just isn't that compelling. I suppose it doesnt help that the character arc of one of the main characters is unsatisfying, even frustrating, but I suppose it could be argued that thats just the way it is sometimes; and it is.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Jeananne Crowley plays Franks live-in non-lover, Professor Julia, while Michael Williams plays the dean of the university and Julias secret lover, Brian. Malcolm Douglas appears as Ritas husband, Denny.

The movie runs 110 minutes and was shot in Dublin, Ireland.

"Again, instead of allowing his characters to carry on conversations or the visual components of his art to speak, Scorcese, master of the voice over, violates a cardinal rule of cinema and allows the audience to forget the dream of the film by constant interruptions by a narrator.  Now a narrator provides a useful function in written fiction, but only disturbs the delicate fabric of film.  Why is it necessary for the narrator to point out what we are seeing?  ""Newland felt this and Newland felt that"".  This is superfluous at best as Mr. Lewis' visage and gestures, his mannerisms all convey the necessary information.  Why can't Scorcese allow his movies to speak for themselves?  Can you imagine ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Citizen Kane"" with voiceovers?  In the latter masterpiece Welles' has characters in the film speak their voice overs which is what one wishes this director would do.  Imagine the first scene of ""The Godfather"" with voice overs.

"Excellent depiction of an era through gorgeous, meticulously detailed scenes, but this was not one of Daniel Day Lewis' better performances.  In an attempt to capture the character, he gave a listless, passionless, vapid performance. Now that I'm fully awake, I want to add that the movie is worth viewing but Day Lewis seemed to spend most of the picture trying to find his character, and, consequently, his performance came off as wooden, stilted and sleep-inducing. This might be due more to the director's trying to find the characters and the tone of the times.  Performances were good but not nuanced enough.

With all the build up the trailer gives you, going into the watching of this film you expect a wildly romantic love affair between the books two main characters.

When I think of romantic tragedy I at least like to think the hero & heroin of the story at least share time together loving one another.

The reviews have always been so favorable for this film and when I saw it listed as one of the 100 5-star movies by a much respected film magazine, I decided it was time to purchase it.  I was sadly disappointed after viewing it.  Although it was extremely beautiful to look at and the attention to details by the art director impeccable, it was leaden and boring.  I agree with another reviewer who said that they were not happy with the odd camera techniques employed...for seemingly no good reason.  It was very distracting.  The acting was sufficient.  I was particularly impressed with Winona Ryder's work.  Never one of my favorites, she was able to convey with subtlety, the turmoil and anger her character was feeling underneath a surface of sweetness and calm.  I wouldn't have thought her capable of such a performance.  When it was over, I found myself thinking, ""Where did it all go wrong and why didn't it work?""

"The Age of Innocence is a beautiful period piece based on the classic novel, it's still strange to me that this film was directed by Martin Scorcese. Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Winona Ryder play the lead characters, Pfeiffer is so vulnerable and stunning here - she never got the respect she deserved as a serious actress. I like this film but it isn't flawless but still good enough to check it out, enjoy!",3.0

"Tried to care about this elegant saga, but despite all the fetching details and careful crafting, it all feels rather pointless. Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a radiant performance in her effort to negotiate these overstuffed rooms and overwrought sensibilities, but can't quite manage it.

The stumbling point, in my view, Daniel Day-Lewis here plainly just doesn't cut it as a leading man. His emasculated, simpering deadpan, dispensing dialogue medicinally as so much cough syrup, completely fails to engage as a romantic figure. The notion of Michelle's ravishing, vivacious character head over heels for him is more than a stretch. I've seen gunfighters with more chemistry than these two. Their first intimate scene, eek! Comes off like a stumble in a crowded bus. This mis-casting is disappointing, as the movie appears in many ways to have had real promise.

Wynona Ryder does well enough as the porcelain, sidelined fiance, but what does it matter, the whole thing fails on the glaring mismatch of the leads.",3.0
"I found it very difficult to get into this film.  I normally like period pieces and I normally have absolutely no problem with slow moving dramas but this film felt like it was going no where for so long.  I will say that after you got passed the first thirty or so minutes it grabbed my attention and kept me entertained for the remainder of the film.  While it's not a film I would own or dare I say ever really watch again it's a film I'm glad I saw at least once.  Pfeiffer was remarkable here, inhibiting her character and oozing forth with charm and elegance and this undeniable sexuality.  Daniel Day Lewis was also well cast as social scion Newland Archer who is torn between his engagement to May (Ryder) and her cousin the Countess Olenska (Pfeiffer).  The film was beautifully shot so I will give Scorsese props for his directing, I just wish that it would have really struck me and made me want to watch it again, but it didn't.  It's not a bad movie but it's far from great.",3.0

"Martin Scorsese and his team have faithfully captured the atmosphere of Edith Wharton's magnificent novel, and most of the actors are up to the task.  The production design and music are particularly splendid.  But Michelle Pfeiffer is all wrong for the role of Ellen Olenska.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say she ruins the movie.  She's the wrong physical type, the wrong emotional type.

Ellen is supposed to be a mysterious, exotic woman -- ""different,"" as Newland Archer puts it.  But Pfeiffer is anything but different.  She's too all-American, too garden-variety-pretty, too much the cheerleader type.  It's not that she doesn't have acting chops in general -- she's normally an excellent actress -- but she doesn't have what it takes to carry off this role.  She even resorts to a kind of kooky, indefinable, faux-foreign accent at times, to signal, I suppose, that Ellen has been living in Europe for years.  She's just all wrong.  That's why I give this otherwise spectacular film only 3 stars.  Imagine what a more appropriate actress could have done with this role!  Smoldered right through the screen.

Anyway, you can always read the book, which is easily 5 stars and then some.",3.0
"I read the book The Age of Innocence and enjoyed it, though I felt the romance around which the action revolved was difficult to comprehend.  The over all development of the theme in the book, however, was far more complete than that in the film.
The action of the movie seemed almost stream of consciousness, although from whose perspective was somewhat difficult to say.  It was if Scorcese expected the viewer to be familiar enough with the book to fill in the blanks.  The characters' speech and mannerisms were studied and slow, as though they lived in so rarefied an atmosphere, that they were too delicate to withstand a normal everyday pace to life.  (Maybe that's my own generation speaking however; we certainly live in a sped up world today.  It's as though we are living at 78 rpms and they were at 45, to use old turn table terms).  The splendor and pageantry of the upper class of the age was enjoyable, and the cinematography that highlighted the lifestyle was incredible.  The dinner sequences with the multitudes of courses, each carefully and artfully arranged for the guests was very impressive.  The period gowns were exquisite.  I was speechless over the tableau of famous artists displayed on the walls of the homes of the characters, paintings or replicas of works in the style of Renoir, Van Gogh, Monet, Singer Seargent, and classical types by earlier painters.  I was especially impressed to see the incredible ""Dual after the Ball"" by Jean Gerome hanging over a settee in one of the homes.  It's one of my favorite paintings.
Again, as in the book, the romance seemed tepid.  The illicit lovers were hardly alone together enough to have gotten past social pleasantries when they are expressing enduring passion.  This is true of the book too, but in the book there is a certain sense of the ridiculous, a sense of two self centered people enjoying tormenting themselves over a relationship they couldn't have.  From the book one comes away with a sense that a young man with everything to lose was kept on the straight and narrow by conniving relatives who have his best interests at heart, like an Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw manner play.  The Scorsese film has more of the feel of Ibsen, parted lovers doomed to plodding through life without one another, mere spectators to the drama of other people's lives.  Maybe that's how we all feel as we give up youthful dreams for the responsiblities of adulthood.",3.0
"I am one who usually thinks that the book is much better than the movie was very surprised to find it quite opposite in this instance. The book which although beautifully written, drags in parts.

"Nothing quite compares to the opulence of an Edith Wharton novel. Wharton was the best at capturing all the essential details of society... not society in a sociological sense but SOCIETY, high society. The film does not quite compare, although the time period is well served with the scenery and costuming. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Madame Olenska, who seizes Daniel Day-Lewis's heart. He contemplates leaving his wife, played by a very innocent-seeming Winona Ryder. Ryder, however, manages to be just conniving enough to restrain her husband. She announces she is pregnant just as he announces he plans to travel for an indefinite period of time. The passion between Newland (Day-Lewis) and Olenska is represented well on-screen, and you can feel the sadness and their never seeing one another again after May, Ryder's character, has children. It is a rather romantic story, but nevertheless semi-tragic. Personally I am not a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or Winona Ryder, and these roles did not change my mind.",3.0
"EDITH WHARTON's wonderful novel is certainly good looking on the screen ,but it is a misfire most of the time,because we simply can't feel anything for those characters. One must salute SCORSESE for trying something different ,but this is simply not his cup of tea. Actors in general are not to blame,especially MICHELE PFEIFFER who tries to inject some vitality to her character. DAY-LEWIS is incredibly stiff and so is RYDER as gorgeous as she is. If you read most of WHARTON's novels, you know most of her men are boring characters except in THE HOUSE OF MIRTH.Fortunally for us, an adaptation of this novel is due soon.",3.0
"Martin Scorsese's talents shine very clearly in this movie, as it remains, to me anyway, as one of his best films! It's a movied filled with beauty from every aspect: the acting, the directing,the music, the screenplay,and the cinematography. Everything is stunningly perfect in this film. Martin Scorsese is a director of rare talent, and was unrightly over looked for an Oscar nomination for this movie. Luckily the Academy didn't over look Winona Ryder in this movie, as her performance is one of the many reasons to watch this movie, which is based on Edit Wharton's novel of the same title. Michelle Pfeiffer, in my opinion delievers her best performance to date! This is a movie where one doesn't have to be a Scorsese fan to enjoy it. All you have to do is sit down and relax and watch this modern masterpiece.",3.0
"The issue of leaking information to the press has been around for years, and this film does its best to illustrate how badly it can backfire when the sources aren't properly checked and re-checked.

It just isn't done.  If you can accept this HUGE leap of  journalistic and editorial faith, then the rest of the movie is a  breeze.
Aside from Newman, I think the best performance in the movie is  one of the briefest...Wilford Brimley as the U.S. Attorney who gets to the  bottom of the mess.  It's just a pleasure to watch him go through the paces  of tearing Bob Balaban's little vendetta all to pieces, and to experience  his grudging approval to let Newman walk.",3.0

"Paul Newman is cast as a businessman  whose only links to organised crime are tenuous at best -via an uncle (Luther Adler -excellent as ever)-but because he is the son of a long dead mobster ,is believed by a hotheaded Federal prosecutor (Bob Balaban)to possibly be able to help them crack an ongoing investigation that has stalled .This investigation revolves around the disappearance of a prominent mobster in Miami where the action takes place .

Seeing an opportunity and untramelled by such niceites as ethics he leaks the news of Gallagher's possible ""complicity""to an ambitious journalist ,Megan (Sally Field).She swallows the bait and writes a story full of iron clad innuendo implicating Gallagher ,a tale splashed all across the front pages .The story comes close to destroying his life and tragedy follows in its wake. With a contrite Megan as ally -she and Gallagher having become romantically involved-he decides to strike back at the people who have so cavalierly treated him and his family .

The work raises key questions of media responsibility ,and sadly ,fudges them at key points but the movie is still poilished ,literate entertainment which would work well on a double bill with All The President's Men as it is  a counterpart to that movie in some ways While the Bernstein/Woodward movie amounted to a hagiographic portrait of journalists this  tends towards a more jaundiced viewpoint and is for my money the more interesting piece as a result

Performances are uniformly excellent with Balaban especially outstanding .This repays  watching if only for the way it asks us to look at issues of media ethics and mores .It sharply portrays the downside to irresponsible investigative reporting  and corrects the glib Hollywood l notion that journalists are heroes-sometimes ,sure ,but they can do a lot of harm and this movie entertainingly ecposes this aspect to the fourth estate.",3.0
"This movie depends for its climax upon Paul Newman's tricking the other people in the movie.  Other than that, there's little drama in the movie.  The affair between Newman and Field is not credible, nor is the incident in which Newman throws Field on the floor and rips her blouse, yet she does not report him to the police.  The acting and pacing are good, if unexceptional.",3.0
"Absence of Malice was shocking to me, especially viewing it during the arrogant gotcha journalism of today, where reporters think they have a right to print anything and are ""protected"" by the First Amendment (see Judith Miller, still sitting in jail).  Wilfred Brimley's comment at the end refuting Sally Field's lawyer's silly First Amendment defense was classic.

But the film really lacks any type of energy.  I felt like falling asleep during most of it; the romance between Field and Newman is ridiculous and should've been removed from the movie; also, there really is no final climatic scene.  The best scene is of Newman's gal pal shamefully removing the newspapers from the neighborhood.  Very heartbreaking.

But, I give Pollack credit for taking on this subject, especially after all of us were taught in the mid to late 70s that journalists were the ultimate ""guardians of the truth,"" who were only out for the public good (thanks to Woodward & Bernstein).  I'd be interested to go back and find out how this movie was received by the establishment media and critics in the early 80s.  I bet that they were not happy.",3.0
"The movie is an OK exercise in First Amendment privileges and the power of the press to ruin innocent people's lives, but basically it turns a yawn-making subject into a Florida travelogue that rivals MIAMI VICE and De Palma's SCARFACE for imaginative use of Florida locations.

Sally Field and Paul Newman make an uneasy match together.  The truth is that, at 55, he is a wee bit too old for her and might well have played her father.  She isn't looking good either, but I give her credit for taking a part which isn't entirely sympathetic, for she could have traded on her lovability factor (""You like me!"") for years without wandering into the heavy waters of something like ABSENCE OF MALICE.  Paul Newman has a role made for him, down to the twist ""Sting"" ending which will remind you of a dozen other movies he made over the years (and continues to make, God bless him).  --Such as THE VERDICT or BUTCH CASSIDY.

With his frosty blue eyes I can see him playing an Irishman, though it's a stretch.  This is right around the period where his screen persona began to go over the top, from leading man to full-on legend, and he hasn't really aged since.  Eighty this year, Newman remains one of our favorite leading men, but ABSENCE OF MALICE doesn't really do anything for him one way or the other.  Melinda Dillon, whose career really should have been a big one, shows a lot of restrained power here, but nothing that suggests that she and Sally Field should have switched roles as was whispered back during the original release of this movie.",3.0
"After seeing the horrible ""reworking"" done on Nakata Hideo's scare-fest ""RING"" by director Gore Verbinski and DreamWorks-- and seeing how director Walter Salles intends to 'one-up' Verbinski with his complete mangling of another Nakata masterpiece, ""HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA"" (currently in production as ""DARK WATER"" with Disney/Touchstone as joint culprit) --I had some hesitation about wanting to see the Hollywood remake of ""JUON."" But four specific things fueled my interest in this Occidental revision entitled ""The Grudge"":

(1) It would keep the story set in Japan, using many of the same sets and actors of the original series;

(2) Sam Raimi (""The Evil Dead"") not only put up the money to have this movie remade, but he was so appreciative of the original Japanese theatrical production (and so confident of the success of the remake) that he was instrumental in getting ""JUON"" a wide US distribution even before the remake was completed and released to theatres;

(3) Raimi insisted that Shimizu Takashi, the director of the original productions, be retained as the director of the US remake as well;

(4) The pre-release trailers of the film made it unambiguously obvious that, unlike the distorted crud given to us by the teams of DreamWorks/Verbinski & Disney/Salles, ""The Grudge"" was going to be a true ""remake"" that remained VERY faithful to the original material.

Of course, none of that could guarantee that I'd be 100% satisfied with the result because, sadly, I wasn't. But that doesn't mean it was a bad movie or a failed experiment -- there is still much to like about this movie even for hardened ""Juon Junkies"" like myself. It's just that this film, as faithful a remake as it was, just didn't have the right kind of ""texture"": Gone was the gloominess & ambiance of the original productions, gone was the slow-paced and the tension build-up, gone was the ""REAL"" reason Saeki Takeo murdered his family (but, of course, reusing the original Japanese cast as the Saeki family, that really could not have been helped short of casting Jason Scott Lee or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa in the ""Kobayashi-sensei/Peter"" role), and gone was the ""REAL"" reason Kayako makes that unsettling croaking noise (and it's not the reason they try to make you believe it is in the remake). There was never a moment in the film where I was not aware that I was watching a ""Hollywood"" production -- all of the ""Asian qualities"" I liked so much about the original series just weren't in this movie, and it's not because of the presence of Caucasian actors and English dialogue. My difficulty in relating to this remake stems from the fact that the presentation was too bright, too loud, too fast, too sanitized, too refined, too perfect -- lacking all the ""rawness"" and the pure emotion of the original series.

For those not all that familiar with what I'm talking about, ""The Grudge"" is based on a series of movies called ""JUON"" or ""JU-ON"" (literal translation: ""curse grudge""). It began as a two-part 'V-Cinema' (Japan's version of 'made-for-television/video') series called, appropriately, ""JUON"" and ""JUON 2"" -- which were marketed (but not ""officially"" titled) with the English companion title, ""THE CURSE."" Because of the immediate success of these two V-Cinema productions, writer/director Shimizu Takashi was given a bigger budget to work with along with a green light to begin work on a theatrical version, that was released under the name, ""JUON"" -- which, after a successful run in theatres throughout Asia, was followed by a theatrical sequel called, you guessed it, ""JUON 2."" In order to alleviate some of the confusion that was certain to arise, ""JUON"" and ""JUON 2,"" the theatrical versions, were distinguished from their V-Cinema counterparts by being given the marketed (yet still ""unofficial"") English title, ""THE GRUDGE.""

Contrary to popular misinformation spreading about, ""Juon"" (theatrical) is not a remake of ""Juon"" (v-cinema), but is, along with the theatrical sequel, a ""continuation"" of the same story; much like ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" is a 'continuation' of the original Star Trek television series' ""Space Seed"" episode. So, in actuality, the theatrical release of ""Juon"" and its sequel are best described as ""Juon, part 3"" and ""Juon, part 4"" respectively.

Because most of the people who learn of the original story generally become familiarized only with the first theatrical production (""Part 3""), they naturally assume that ""The Grudge"" is a remake of that film, when in reality the Western remake incorporates important story elements from both the first 'theatrical' production (""Part 3"") and the first 'video' production (""Part 1""), thereby providing much of the ""back story"" one would normally not have if they were only familiar with the theatrical releases of the original story. So, in this sense, ""The Grudge"" provides some important (but really not all that necessary) background details for those who have seen ""Juon"" (the movie) but were unable to gain access to the original V-Cinema productions.

Anyway, as the opening screen text explains (in all five films), ""Juon"" refers to [paraphrasing] a curse that is born when someone dies violently in the grip of a powerful rage where there is great resentment, etc., etc. Because of having died such an undignified death, the resentment (or 'grudge') lingers & festers in the place(s) where the horrific murders occurred, which then indiscriminately lashes out at ANYONE (male, female, adult, child, rich, poor, married, single, Asian, Caucasian, Terran, Martian, whatever) who trespasses upon the cursed site -- in this case, the central location where the curse resides & emanates from is a typical Japanese ""middle-class"" house (in the V-Cinema, it is the same house plus another apartment in a different part of town). The curse does not always manifest itself right away; in fact, it might take years before the cursed spirits enact their rage against their victims -- and the victims are not always dispatched the same way: some get strangled, some get literally ripped to pieces, others just ""disappear,"" and so on. The spectres are also not bound by the time/space continuum as we know it, often creating temporal shifts and so-forth. Also, in the ""Juon"" series, each attack has the potential for creating a new ""juon"" (i.e., the victim could then be 'reborn,' as it were, as another vengeful spirit), but ""The Grudge"" plays down this aspect of the curse and pretty much just sticks with building up the body count. And unlike ""RING,"" there is no way to break the curse or to keep it from spreading other than to just stay out of that damned house.

And though Mr. Raimi chose to keep the story set in its native Japan and limited the use of Caucasian actors, I am convinced that the film could have just as easily been set in NYC, L.A., or here in Honolulu, where heavy Asian populations reside and speak English as their native language, assuming that it was his intent was to cater to Japanese or other Asian cultural themes. Such a move could have been just as effective and would have given him better rationale for using Caucasian-American actors. But because of using a new cast of white American characters in Japan while having key members of the Japanese cast reprise their original roles, the story as it plays out in the remake loses some of its effectiveness and justifications, due to the inability to duplicate certain situations which account for some of the specific behaviors associated with certain characters, thus resulting in slightly different interpretations of the two films.

As far as recommending this movie on its own merits, I'd have no problem encouraging the 'uninitiated' to give it a fair look.

To those who are familiar with any of the ""Juon"" presentations (esp. those privileged enough to have viewed all four original entries), my recommendation comes a bit harder. Again, as I've already expressed, my specific prejudices have already influenced my decision to not include this remake in my personal collection, but if you're stoked to see a remake that is ""truly"" a remake, which remains very faithful to the original and refuses to take ""dumbed-down"" Hollywood-style 'liberties' with the source material, then you just might appreciate this movie on that level. On the other hand, if you, like myself, appreciated the ethereal qualities and slow-pace of the originals, I'm not so enthusiastic about recommending it outright, and I would suggest renting it out first before jumping in head-first.

In any event, it's really not a terrible movie; and for newbies, it could open a whole new window into Asian cinema. ~ Aloha!",3.0

"I finally got around to watching this in 2013. I had wanted to for quite some time since I keep hearing that ""If you liked The Ring then you will love this"". Many even say it is better than The Ring. In my opinion, that is not the case. Not by a long shot. Seems the only real point of comparison between the two is that they both have creepy kids as their ghosts. While it is by no means boring it is kind of senseless and poorly paced. Sarah Michelle Gellar did a fine job in a role which had so little screen time in the film that I wonder why bother at all? Worse still is Bill Pullman... sorry no spoilers here.

Anyway, a little creepy here and there with some slow plot revelation that didn't do much for me.",3.0
"I found this horror film watchable, but still it disappointed me a little as it is nowhere near the level of ""The Ring"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

PRECISION: I never watched the original ""Ju-on: the grudge"" Japanese version so I am unable to compare it to this American remake.

Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is an American nurse living and working in Tokyo. She is efficient and hardworking and therefore she handles already numerous assignments, but her boss Alex (Ted Raimi) asks her to take one more patient, an aged American woman named Emma Williams (Grace Zabriskie). Emma lives alone in a large and old (by Tokyo's standards) house and she needs care because she suffers from dementia and lethargy  - or Yoko (Yoko Maki), the usually very reliable previous nurse assigned to her didn't report to work for a couple of days...

This actually is not the real beginning of the story, because the action of this film is as non-linear as it is humanly possible, with numerous flash-backs and with some new plots kicking in all the time - and that is precisely part of my problem with ""The Grudge"". Non-linear narration is a very excellent thing but only if the director keeps things under strict control - here it is not the case and even if the logic of the story is ultimately preserved it takes a great effort to keep up with the developments. Personally, considering that the film was not so good anyway, towards the end I didn't feel like making this effort anymore because all those narrative acrobatics tired me instead of intriguing...

The other problem I had with this film that, unlike the chillingly terrifying ""The Ring"", this film is hardly scary AT ALL. There is only a couple of really good scenes, but in a 92 minutes film it is not nearly enough.

The main strength of this film is in Sarah Michelle Gellar, who reveals herself here as a much better actress than usually believed - and of course she is still cute as a button, exactly as in ""Buffy"" TV series. Her character is likeable and clearly vulnerable (do not expect any martial arts) and therefore I was concerned about what will happen to her all the time - it was actually what kept me watching this thing until the very end...

The other asset is Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi), a tough, courageous and competent police officer who already had to do with Emma's house in the past and is clearly scared s***less by this place - but nevertheless will do his duty with cold, resigned resolution.

Still, the good points notwithstanding, this is not a very successful film. Watchable, but nothing more and especially nowhere near the quality of ""The Ring"".",3.0
"This movie was extremely popular and supposedly scared the hell out of a lot of people. This films popularity and scariness were lost on me. It is a well made movie, but it's very predictable and unrealistic. As if any ghost movie is realistic. The Grudge stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, whom I regard as an average actress. I don't think she can single handedly carry a movie on her back and make it a classic. Nonetheless people like the hell out of this movie. I don't get it though. The ghost that is after her crawls around on the floor. It is able to follow her out of the house that it is supposedly haunting, but it's just not spooky. I can't really think of anything to say about this movie. It's not bad, but it's not good either. The one amazing thing about The Grudge is how overrated it is.",3.0
"An American couple, Matthew [William Mapother] and Jennifer [Clea DuVall] living in Japan move into a perfect little house with their mother, Emma [Grace Zabriskie], who requires care due to dementia. What they do not know is that the house is inhabited by two very angry ghosts, Kayako [Takako Fuji] and her son, Toshio [Yuya Ozeki], who are bent on spreading a curse to all who come in contact with them. When caregiver Karen Davis [Sarah Michelle Gellar] comes to care for the ailing Emma, the curse spreads beyond the house, rippling through the city in waves of rage and death.

The film is almost a literal translation of the very fine original, Ju-on, and that makes it quite a disappointment. No new dimensions are added, even with the twist of bringing American characters into Japanese culture. With such a close remake, even using some of the same actors, it is clear that director Takashi Shimuzi was happy enough with his first attempt, and the reason for making an Americanized version a mystery (not really, it is mostly likely financial reasons, but what a poor reason to make art).",3.0
"This was a really stupid movie.  I only gave it 3 stars because of Jason Behr, but unfortunately he doesn't get much screen time.  If you want to watch a great horror movie, get ""The Tattooist"", which is 100 times better than ""The Grudge.""",3.0
"Despite some genuinely scary moments, I never bought into this film.  I had three primary problems with it.  First, the ghosts had no idea how to do things ""comme il faut"".  Where was the build-up of suspense, fear, and terror?  What was this uncouth business of attacking people barely two minutes after they entered the house?  I mean, really!  Second, I was taken aback (and displeased by) the ghosts' ability to do physical harm.  What were they, ghosts -- or goons?  And the reverse should be true as well, shouldn't it?  What were these people waiting for to bring a baseball bat down on the heads of these creeps?  If nothing else, it would have given me enormous satisfaction -- I found the unrelenting and indiscriminate nature of the ghosts' vengefulness extremely irritating and tiresome.  Finally, I thought it ridiculous that anyone and everyone who so much as dared to set a toe in the house was doomed (not just in the house, but regardless of where they went).  What was this movie about, ghosts -- or the Ebola Virus?  At the rate these ghosts were going, all of Japan would have been dead within the month -- with, no doubt, the rest of the world soon to follow.

Not recommended.",3.0
"but she was surprisingly lacking in this film.  There are some genuine jump moments (anytime Yuya Ozeki or Takako Fuji are in the frame) and the supporting cast is good (Ted Raimi as a social work facilitator not so good-he showed frustration almost constantly), but Gellar, as Karen Davis, just doesn't have broad enough shoulders to carry a film like this.  The phasing from story to story, so you could get the full picture of how insidious the hatred enveloping this house really is, was interesting.  I liked seeing all the concurrent stories that led up to the moment when Karen tried to burn down the house to kill the spirit.  I enjoyed Clea Duvall's portrayal of sadness and isolation at being in a foreign country, where hardly anyone spoke english.  Her growing frustration and withdrawal from her surroundings made her ultimate demise at the hands of the house very poignant.  But best of all was Yuya Ozeki as Toshio.  The child is beautiful when he looks normal, but put him in that white makeup, with the black eyes and sinisterly sad expression, and you have some really creepy moments when he's in frame.  Takako Fuji as Kayako was also creepy and weird.  Her face, it's almost plastic expressionlessness, was wonderfully scary to behold.  Her flexibility and disjointedness when she crawled down the stairs after Karen was astounding.  And how she got her hand under Gellar's hair on the back of her head in the shower is truly baffling.  A creepy little film (dumbed down for American audiences by Takashi Shimizu, who directed the original Japanese versions), but the original is better.",3.0
"The scariest thing to come out of Japan since Pink Lady, The Grudge tells the story of a young woman who travels to Japan with her underwear-sniffing boyfriend and soon finds herself in the clutches of an evil curse (as if having an underwear-sniffing boyfriend wasn't bad enough). Bill Pullman co-stars, sort of, in that he speaks several lines of dialogue. In contrast to a high body count slasher film, The Grudge is infused with a suffocating sense of dread, very much like an average episode of According to Jim. Kevin Murphy and Mike Nelson settle their own grudge in this not-to-be-missed RiffTrax.

Note: This Grudge works only with the theatrical release of the movie, not the Director's Cut",3.0
"""The Grudge"" is the American remake of Japan's ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", and while it's nowhere near on par with remakes like ""Dark Water"", ""The Ring"" or ""The Ring Two"", it does stand pretty well on its own.  In sharp contrast to the Ring/Ringu situation though (I can't compare the two ""Dark Water""s, as I still haven't gotten to the 2002 original), ""The Grudge"" is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of ""Ju-On"", bringing little new to the table.

  As with the original, ""The Grudge"" follows the premise of a legend in Japanese folklore (apparantly really a part of that tradition and not just made up for the movie) - a person who dies an unnatural death, in the grip of a rage, will sometimes become a ghost known as a Ju-On.  These spirits are violent and vengeful and, judging from the ""Ju-On"" and ""Grudge"" movies, seem to act not necesarily in accordance with the kinds of people they were when alive, but lashing out quite indiscriminately in rage over the injustice of their own demise.  They seem incapable of differentiating between the living who they would have reason to bear anger against, and just the living in general.  Those who are killed by a Ju-On become one themselves, and the curse grows.

  At the risk of repeating myself from when I wrote about ""Ju-On"" in its own entry, the troubles begin when a young home health care worker (who makes her rounds caring for various frail and incapacitated people in their own homes) enters a house to care for a woman who's recently moved with her family into a new home with a dark past.  Invesigating strange noises coming from upstairs, she discovers an unusual little boy behind a boarded-up wall.  And thus the first Ju-On makes his appearance, and the weirdness and darkness begins.

  ""The Grudge"" has many of the same strengths and many of the same weaknesses as ""Ju-On"", which is fitting I suppose because most of the time they're the same movie, just with different actors (although some from the original reprise their roles here) and spoken in different languages.  As with the first one, there are some pretty implausible actions and reactions on the parts of the human characters in here; I found it overall to be less pronounced in this remake though.  Although both movies unfold in much the same style with regards to timeframes, I found this one easier to make sense of - it may be because I saw the Japanese one first and knew what to expect this time.  Or it may be because when ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" was shot, it was with the expectation that most Asian viewers would have already had a chance to see ""Ju-On: The Curse 1"" and ""Ju-On: The Curse 2"", the two Japanese made-for-tv-movies which ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" was itself a remake of (or, apparantly, it could be viewed as a kind of sequel if one was so inclined; I haven't had a chance to watch those two yet).

  The overall production values in this movie are very good but the ones in ""Ju-On"" were a bit better, except for the special effects.  Here ""The Grudge"" wins out by a fair margin with truly great effects.  Both movies feature the same freakishly disturbing sounds made by the Ju-On ghosrs.  Those bizarre, utterly unnatural noises are just plain scary.

  If one was just going on ""The Grudge"" and ""Ju-On"" you could really just pick either one and miss very little.  However, there's a catch - both movies's sequels are better, and the sequels actually follow completely different storylines from one another.  And they're each better served by seeing their respective predecessor first.  So personally I'd recommend both ""Grudge"" and Ju-On"", although you'll probably want to watch them some time apart rather than one just a few days after the other.  They're both good movies, but I wish they'd made at least a few significant changes in this one; it's a lost opportunity that was, thankfully, more than made up for by the sequels being so far apart.",3.0
"The Grudge is a horror film remake of a Japanese film. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar (of BtVS fame) as an American nurse who is charged to watch over a woman in Tokyo. Hijinks ensue, as the house of that woman is home to angry spirits, who track down and kill all those who enter the house. The acting's fine, the direction's fine, etc. Really, the big question that must be asked of a horror film is:

Is it scary?

Maybe yes and maybe no, depending on what you think of when you think of the word ""scary.""

The Grudge is not scary in the sense that Rosemary's Baby or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane were scary. It's not scary in the same way that Psycho, Alien, Halloween or Scream were scary. It's not even scary the same way the Final Destination movies were scary. It's nothing psychological. It's not the ambience. You won't walk away from the movie looking around corners or afraid to turn out the lights. Instead, the movie is scary because the visuals are disturbing and they jump out at you from out of nowhere, with a crash of music.

You see, the special effects/make-up team do a great job at creating scary-looking ghosts to terrify Sarah Michelle Gellar, and when they leap out at you with little warning, you'll get a jolt. It's reflexive, kind of like how you'll flinch if something's thrown at your face. But it's hardly the same kind of terror as the true classics of the genre.

Real horror isn't *just* things jumping at you, but it's a sense of how and why they're jumping out; the context. In The Grudge, apparently you're a target because you step foot in the wrong home (where bad things, of course, have happened). After that, you're hunted down by the spirits until they... well... we don't actually know *what* they do. We only know that they look scary, and their victims die in some unspecified way. Why are the spirits able to dispatch some victims quite easily while others resist for some period of time? Don't know. Is there any way of fighting back against the spirits? Don't know. Why did the spirits materialize here, specifically, as opposed to all of the other scenes of violent crimes that pepper our lands? Don't know.

Basically, the plot has so many holes, because the plot is unimportant to the film, which holds itself as nothing more than a delivery system for those ""jump out at you"" moments. Without a real context, you're only scared when the freaky-looking ghosts are on screen; the terror fades as soon as they're gone. While it's scary in a dark theater, it doesn't hold up once you're back out in the sunshine. A fun flick to see once, perhaps, but not something you'll be discussing in 5 years, or really even 5 weeks.

Three stars, because it does what it wants to do and is executed well in terms of production values, acting, etc. It wants the last two stars, however, because it's lightweight and horror of the most fleeting kind.",3.0
"In THE GRUDGE a nurse fails to show up for work at the home of an American family living in Tokyo and an American exchange nurse-student, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is asked to drop by as her replacement. Karen finds the old lady to be mute and sleeps throughout the day. Strange events occur in the house and Karen discovers that the building seems to be tainted by a curse caused by a grudge. Strange events begin to happen and people start dying. No matter how many victims are killed, The Grudge just won't stop. It seems that an evil emotion that takes the former of frightening-looking, blue Asian children and a sound that sounds like someone with a chicken bone stuck in their throat just can't be appeased.

I watched THE GRUDGE with a group of friends late one night. Many of them were scared throughout the movie and couldn't go to sleep that night. Some of my friends didn't find the movie frightening at all, but several days later found that they were having nightmares and couldn't go to sleep. Japanese horror movies seem to have a psychological effect on some people that lets them experience terror when they would least expect it (I know people who were affected by THE RING the same way).

However, I found THE GRUDGE to be one of the silliest, funniest, and most convoluted films that I have seen in a long time. I busted up laughing during the movie several times and was given strange stares by those around me. I just didn't find the movie very scary. Also, unlike some of my friends I didn't wake up days later having nightmares. Instead, I would find myself laughing at inopportune moments as I remembered some of the scenes from the movie. Most people I have talked to have thought my reactions to the film rather strange, but I have a friend who is a director and though he didn't find the movie to be funny, he did say ""it's garbage"".

There are many who will find the movie quite frightening. Personally, I recommend it to see the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar. She might not be a great actress, but she is attractive. The film also has Bill Pullman in a supporting role and Pullman is usually a joy to watch on the big screen, too. Overall, though I didn't find THE GRUDGE very scary at all, I know that many do and it is seeing at least once for Gellar and Pullman's performances.",3.0
"Perhaps I was expecting more because I'm a huge Buffy fan and Sarah is a good actress overall.

I thought this movie would be more of a supernatural theme; ghosts, evil spirits, hauntings and so on.

But it was more of a drama based movie than a thiller.

I do have to admit there was one scene that flashed so quickly it did startle me and the sound effects were not so bad. Quite chilling.

Overall it was an okay movie. One that I'll take out in a year or so after I've watched all my other thillers and ghosty goulish movies.",3.0
"I didn't expect much from the Grudge.  Whenever a trailer has difficulty in explaining the plot, I lower my expectations.  ""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born"" seems a bit awkward.  The ""grip"" of a ""powerful"" rage?  Not a really bad rage?  What exactly is a rage's grip anyway?

This challenge, the failure to explain exactly the plot behind the horror, saps the terror from the movie.  I should warn readers now that I'm going to make a lot of comparisons to The Ring, a movie that scared the living crap out of me, because the two have a lot of similarities. We are venturing into Spoilerland.

So let's talk about similarities.  Although The Grudge is most certainly not a copy of The Ring, there are enough similarities to make comparisons inevitable. Besides the simplistic titles (""The NOUN, a new Japanese horror, coming to a theater near you!""), both films feature crawling girls with long hair covering their faces, a viral curse, and ghosts that defy the traditional boundary of staying in their respective haunted houses.  The climax is even similar: both heroines struggle to save the male love interest before he too becomes infected.

The primary difference between the two films is style. Where The Ring creates a set of rules and then systematically breaks them (or, depending on your perspective, doesn't break them at all but stops reminding you about them), The Grudge isn't encumbered by such rules, to its detriment.  This makes the movie hard to follow. In addition, the scenes unfold out of order, explaining what happened to each victim and thereby illustrating the original murder, Memento style.

Here's what I was able to piece together from the deleted scenes: Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Takeo (Takashi Matsuyama) Saeki move into a new home with their son, Toshio (Yuya Ozeki) and his pet cat.  While attending school, Kayako becomes infatuated with Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman), her professor.  When Takeo discovers her many love notes to the professor, he goes on a berserk rage, murdering Kayako, Toshio, and the cat. Then he kills himself.

The curse kicks in pretty quickly after that.  Peter discovers something is wrong and visits the house, only to be infected by the curse, which eventually causes him to throw himself off a rooftop.

Three years later, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her pretty-boy boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr) move to Japan as part of an exchange program.  Karen is a healthcare worker who specializes in taking care of the elderly.  A house now inhabited by the Williams family, including Matthew (William Mapother), his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall), and Matthew's elderly mother Emma (Grace Zabriskie).  When the regular healthcare worker doesn't show up for work one day, Karen is called in to pick up the slack. She's got a new assignment that just happens to be in that Saeki house...

The beauty of The Ring was the development of its characters.  It established people who, when faced with spreading evil or the death of their family, gladly chose the greater evil.  It dove into the complicated relationship between two parents in a modern age who don't know how to be adults, much less parents.  And it peeled away at the voyeuristic core in every one of us, who engages in peeping merely by sitting in a movie theater or watching television...and then punished us for it.

The Grudge is not nearly so high-minded. The curse spreads quickly; so quickly, in fact, that I had a vision of the Japanese National Guard being finally called in to stop the madness when two hundred people are found dead at the Sakei house.  Ghosts change form, appear on camera, make weird cat noises, show up seemingly at random, and kill some people quickly but take longer to murder others.

I've never been a fan of Gellar, and her performance didn't change my mind. Karen has no spark with Doug on screen, and their relationship is barely fleshed out.  Culture shock is briefly explored in Jennifer's struggle with understanding the Japanese world, but not enough to make us really feel her pain.  Not even Jennifer's relationship with Matthew has any real depth. And Gellar seems way too old to be a giddy exchange student.

The only characters that are actually fleshed out are the members of the Sakei family.  The deleted scenes make it clear that we're not witnessing one traditional American ghost haunting, but a ghost house of sorts, which utilizes all four bodies (yes, even the cat), to kill its victims.  And we come to realize that they are all reenacting their deaths over and over, from the croak of Kayako's severed vocal chords to the shriek of Toshio's poor cat.  Unfortunately, critical plot points connecting the first murders with the subsequent deaths were cut, seriously undermining the shuffled scenes. Half the fun is piecing together why the curse took place and connecting the murders to the original event; when you can't make those connections, the film just becomes incoherent.

And that's the problem.  With a ghost that can invade your office building, your home, or your bed, we lose all hope that the heroine can even defeat it.  The final solution, that the house must be burned to the ground, doesn't seem like a solution at all.  When the ghost(s) can look like people you know and call you on your cell phone, the evil seems to have such power that we never believe the heroine has a realistic chance of surviving.

The movie is still creepy.  After all, Sam Raimi executive produced. The film is beautifully shot with minimal special effects.  The same creepy-crawly stumbling that made Samara so horrifying is in evidence here.  The Grudge also makes use of a multitude of horrible sounds, including the aforementioned caterwauling and death-rattling.

Unfortunately, that's not enough to really make The Grudge a scary movie for Western audiences.",3.0
"Well, I saw the original first, which, eh, that one was okay too but this one was kind of a little less okay in some parts a little more okay in other parts. For one thing. Ugh, the acting was just really really bad.  It made the movie as a whole just look like a really really low budget old godzilla movie.  The script was just as bad.

However, like the godzilla movies, there's just something interesting about the plot that grabs you.  Now the original grudge done in japan ju-on would've been better but it was a little dragged out and well, i'm too used to american special effects. low budget america and low budget japan are two different things. low budget america means cartoon like computer graphics that glow off the screen and looks like a joke, and japan low budget is like, home video camera and planets hanging from little strings.  don't know how anime manages to rock so much with their graphics but i don't think their film industry's quite there yet.

anyway, so ju-on had too many random characters that all did their own thing and met up with the grudge. it was okay but kind of like reading a weekly comic book series with a new episode and adventure every week. so what america does is realize this and chop it up and cut out characters and shorten other characters parts to leave room for a main character and i'm left even more confused with the newer version than the original.

so now i'm complaining that ju-on dragged, and the grudge was a rushed chopped up piece of bad acted out liver with sarah michelle geller in it who really really disappointed me considering the fact that i know who she is and therefore i want to be impressed by a veteran actress and instead had to sit there thinking how old she was starting to look. that's bad. when i sit there just thinking that you're more wrinkled than you were in buffy that means you need to try harder.

however, this is why it gets three stars and not two or one. the japanese version didn't really go anywhere. it introduced the grudge concept. showed off the grudge concept. end. it just did it and that was it. the american version tried to tie it together a little and show why it happened and explained things in a more timely manner. basically like, lets unfold this mystery. this is the mystery building up. this is why. japan was kind of like. this is the grudge. growl. scare. roar. grudge. grrrr. end.

like i said. both movies kind of sucked. i liked it cause i like horror movies but ju-on impressed me more with the scary scenes even with the lesser special effects and comic book like pace and america kind of bored me in that way with the rushed chopped liver aspect. they just didn't reproduce the scary moments well enough and didn't come up with enough unique ones all on their own. but the end was a teeny tiny bit better in the american version. not the whole end. but the endish area was a little better. however, the bad part was america threw in a really cheap thing all of a sudden out of nowhere that america always does where the main character tries to be the hero whereas in the japanese version she was the victim only. end.

My whole point? good concept. done badly. japan's was better overall.  should've tried harder or not at all. could've been great i think. they had the right idea to try a remake just didn't give it their all. they should've taken full advantage of our special effects because that's really sad that the planets hanging from little strings in a video camera impressed me more than our own computer graphics.

i also liked and hated the fact that it was also in japan. for godsake's why don't you just use the same freaking movie set and actors for crying out loud. geez. can't you be a little creative?  not only are we gonna remake a movie almost word for word and image for image, lets make it in the exact same house, in the exact same city, in the exact same foreign language. its like, why'd you even bother with an american version if you're gonna make it in frickin japan. just so you could replace the main character for sarah michelle geller?  geez, all you really had to do was glue and paste then.",3.0
"The main theme of this movie is that a powerful negative force inhabits a place after someone has died a violent death, and that this negative force consumes all who touch the place in which the violent act occurred. This idea is not new, and many conjecture that what people believe are ""ghosts"" are in fact leftover energy from just such traumatic events. However, most American audiences want the ""wronged parties"" or ""ghosts"" to produce a moral outcome- either the punishment of the murderer(s) or the revelation of how the victims died. What most Americans don't really ""get"" or appreciate is this malevolent force striking out at random victims- the current occupants of the house, whoever they may be, however transient. This just spawns more innocent victims and seems pointless. On the positive side, the technical elements of the film were excellent, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary were indeed scary, and the roles were well acted. In fact, for you Buffy fans out there, did you notice that Sarah Michele Gellar was reunited with two BTVS alumni? Jason Behr, who played her love interest, was Billy Ford in ""Lie to Me"", and the American wife who was caring for her mother-in-law before she was murdered by the ""ghosts"" was played by the same actress who played Marcie Ross in ""Out of Mind Out of Sight"" from season one.",3.0
"This is a pretty good movie, perhaps more sickening than terrifying. In fact, I like it a lot better than the Japanease original. However, I hadn't known that the film was shot in Japan until I actually saw it. So my question is: why Americans? Did they just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time? I think the film would have been more meaningful had there been more cross-cultural viewpoints in it. But then they are just dealing with the inexplicable, so perhaps it doesn't matter whether they are Americans or Japanese. And of course they were able to save the house. So the saga continues...",3.0
"Having only heard disappointing reviews about ""The Grudge"", I went into this film with very low expectations.  I had remembered the television previews and decided that I would watch this film if for nothing else, than at least to see what all of the creepy images had to do with.  To my disbelief, this film actually had a decent plot and was told in an interesting enough manner, to keep me fully attentive during the over-drawn portions of the film(and there are many).

The film takes place in Tokyo and we are immediatly introduced to Karen(Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her boyfriend Doug.  They are foreign exchange students attending college and adapting to their new surroundings.  Karen is a social worker and is sent on her first case.  She is to take care of an elderly woman, struggling from what the doctors believe to be dementia.  Well, they are wrong.  As Karen finds out, there is something very wrong with the house this woman is living in and KAren apparently feels it the moment she walks in.  After a hair-raising evening, Karen is sent to a hospital so that she can be kept close watch on.  Oddly enough, the horror and images Karen saw in the house are now following her and won't leave her alone.  In fact, these images are following everyone that has visited the house, including the detectives sent in to see what was going on.  Why?  Did something happen in that house years ago??  Who is the little boy, that is just waaaaaaay too creepy???

These are the questions that will be answered throughout the remainder of the film.

""The Grudge"" does a pretty good job of keeping the viewer rather tense and on the egde of their seat.  This film is another example of the Japanese horror film gone AMerican and I am very curious to see the original Japanese version of this film, as I feel that it would rely much less on the special effects for the scares.  No gore in this film and although the images are scary, our two villians are a little Japanese boy and his mother----not really the sort of folks that will give you nightmares.  It was a good decision to tell this story in non-linear form, as the plot would probably have been much duller and predictable had they not.

All in all, this is a decent film, certainly worth a viewing.  Not suitable for children as the depictions of ghosts are probably going to keep them up nights.

Enjoy!",3.0
"I have not seen the original of this movie, so (if the reviews of others are anything to go by), I am lucky to be able to judge this movie without the acclaimed original in my head as a template.

And, I am both amazed and happy to report, as a movie in its own right, this version of ""The Grudge"" more than holds its own against its contemporary horror heavyweights.

Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar (in a much smaller role than one would have thought) and a host of forgettable extras (with the exception of Bill Pullman, again in a tiny role), this movie loosely follows the `haunted house' plot of so many horror movies - funny goings-on inspire further investigation, leading to a high-body-count misadventure resulting in closure for our hapless heroine - but since ""The Grudge"" rehashes this predictable-ish plot with such undeniable style and flair, as well as a few big twists, we don't mind.

The first thing that strikes me about this movie is that yes, it is genuinely creepy, with some true-blue shock moments. The jump factor is high, and these shocks and scares (bar the initial dealings with Yoko, the care-worker) never feel tired or predictable. It's thanks directly to the expert direction of Takashi Shimizu that this is the case.

Initially, the American Exchange Students-moving-to-Japan plot element feels like a cheat - divisive and base, and a way of moving the action of this remake closer to the tone of the original movie - but happily, an above-average script (for the genre) and a lack of focus on the Westernisation of the lead characters means that this actually works more in the movie's favour. Karen, Doug, the Williams family and the  Kirk family all feel more isolated and alone in their nightmare because of the culture barrier, and not because of some run-of-the-mill horror movie aspects.

Visual effects are minimalist and achingly stylish, the scene with the security cameras and the final black-and-white expository flashbacks are some really marvellous examples of what can be established when real talent sits behind the camera, unencumbered by a desire to show off. Affecting and moving, the washed-out colours and ingenious creatures and set-pieces provide a very sympathetic (almost forgiving!) backdrop for some solid, if unstellar, performances from the cast.

All in all, this really is an excellent effort, and, when taken in-context with its genre peers (The Ring, Dark Water), it's probably the best of the remakes, too. If `Candyman' was the best horror movie of the Ninties, then `The Grudge' is certainly a contender for that crown now. Recommended.",3.0
"Basically everyone told me I had to see The Grudge, but it contained no plot, and they were right. The Grudge might look like a ""The Ring"" rip off but it's not. It is originally a japanese film. I am tired of horror movies that involve Freddy and Jason and last but not least how could we forget our favorite adorable killing doll Chuckie. Seeing this film I must admit is scary. The film uses dark elements to make the film prosper. But the film could have used more. The plot wasn't exactly a ""plot"" and there wasn't really much to see except ""The Grudge"" a demented like being that crawls around in the attic. If you can actually understand the Japanese darkness part element of the film you can understand the horror in the film. The Grudge definetly isn't the best film out there but it definetly puts a horror show out there for its audience. But once again I will say the plot simply-sucks. There isn't much to it besides a bunch of running around and looking in the attic. I would definetly reccomend this film on a night where you have nothing to do and feel like a good scare...",3.0

"The Grudge--- I watched this movie expecting something very similar to the ring, and in this case this was true. However, while the Grudge was sufficiently creepy, unlike the Ring in similar arenas, it failed to deliver when it came to actual scariness. The suspense was ........ suspenseful, and so was the images of something running past , but, like Signs, when the ""monster"" is actually seen, it fails to be scary at  all ( a small boy with a black cat ????)

Furthermore, the plot really is rather generic, and it is very clear when someone is going to die, leaving one unsatisfied , if a little bit freaked out.

Overall, this film gets 3.5 stars, as it was not horrible, just mediocre.",3.0

The Grudge is not scary. It has a lot of cool visuals and creepy situations that make it fun to watch. There are a lot of entertaining scenes. However, a lot of the things that happen are so cheesy and un-realistic that the horror-factor of this film is a negative.

Summary: Not scary. Cool looking. Entertaining.

"This movie was a remake of the Japanese Horror film Ju-On: The Grudge.  In fact, it even has the same director.  However, I think there are a lot of things taken for granted in Japan that Americans don't really understand.

So at the end of the movie I was left scratching my head thinking, ""What did I just watch?""  I understand how the killings started, so maybe a better question was, ""What was the point of this?""  The ending is not an ending at all, but more an opening for a possible sequel.

The strongest aspect of this movie was that the bulk of the gore was left to the imagination of the viewer.  You don't see people getting killed, you see it coming and then the rest is up to you.  I think this actually makes it more scary than seeing what actually does happen.

The best part is that it lowers the rating from an 'R' rating to a 'PG-13' so more people can see it.  With an 'R' rating, this movie would not have made as much as it actually did.

However, if you like a scary movie then go ahead and watch this.  If you don't like them as they keep you up for weeks with nightmares (and you don't want this) then stick with Mary Poppins.  This movie will have you jumping a couple of times.",3.0
"The Grudge would've been a perfect haunted house horror movie if the story was as good as the visuals in it. It doesn't make much sense why the ghosts in the house whom had been victims of a madman would go after people who had nothing to do with their deaths. The curse aspect of the story is not well explained. There were at least ten shocking and scary moments in this movie. The attack in the bedroom was one very memorable scene, as well as the scene when Sarah Michelle Gellar got touched by the hand of the ghost while she was shampooing her hair. I think the special effects and scary scenes are much more powerful than the Original Japanese Version of this film. The Madman's role in this film is zoomed down to almost non-existent, and Gellar's role is enlarged to ensure that she can carry the film to the end. So it's slightly different compared to the Original Version.",3.0
"As I thought, just after three months of the first release of ""The Grudge"", now we get the release of a ""Director's Cut"".  So, the people who really like this film now have to spend additional funds to get a ""complete cut"" of the movie.

Of course, now the movie studios are finding even trickier ways to get your money.  They advertise and ""additional 10 minutes"", but don't tell you that these are not new scenes.  Instead they tack on 10 to 30 seconds to every scene. While this might sum up to an additional 10-15 minutes, the differences are hardly noticeable while watching the film (for example, the ""Hellboy"" director's cut was almost exactly the same film).

If you already bought this film and really like it, it might be worth renting this director's cut to see if you think it's really worth it.  One thing for sure, I no longer buy any movie that I like until it's been on DVD at least 4-6 months.",3.0
"Japan has a long, ghostly tradition with beings from beyond the grave. Nemerous stories and legends  in Japan of these otherworldly visitors abound. Ghosts often play key roles in Kabuki theater and were a favorite though perhaps somewhat overly-used character by Kabuki playwrights. Many of the ghosts that appear in plays and stories are females seeking revenge for wrongs done to them during their lifetime typically by cruel, heartless husbands.

In the old ghost stories, vengeful Japanese ghosts would continue haunt their victims until they went insane, died, or at least made some form of restitution to appease the angry spirits. Some Japanese ghosts were born out of tragedy or sorrow and would haunt any person who came near. These spirits were particularly feared because they represented a danger to all unless they were somehow put to rest.

Although I knew about the horrific nature of old Japanese ghosts, I had thought modern Japanese ghosts would be more polite and demur. I had imagined a modern Japanese ghost timidly coming up to someone and saying ""Suimasen (Excuse me)! BOO! Gomen naisai (I'm sorry)!"" before whisking away. ""The Grudge"" (2004) showed me how wrong I was about modern Japanese phantoms.

""The Grudge,"" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fame, depicts a haunting by very impolite spirits. Gellar plays an American student nurse in Tokyo who accidentally gets involved with a haunted house that has the nasty habit of killing visitors. The ghosts of the house were victims of a tragedy and now they rudely kill anyone who comes in contact with them.

The spirits' motivation for killing is explained at the beginning of the film in a brief written prologue which states: ""when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind.""

For Western audiences it may seem unusual that the two main ghostly antagonists who having been innocent victims of a violent death themselves would seek to cause the death of another innocent person. This flies in the face of a Western audience's sense of justice and fairness.

In many Western ghost stories, ghosts despite their spookiness are often motivated by the same things as living people namely the pursuit of justice for wrongdoings. The ghost of a murdered person will seek vengeance on the person or persons responsible for their death.

If a ghost is malevolent, it often turns out they were a bad person in life - as in the back-story to the main ghost character in the ""Poltergeist"" (1982-1986) movies.

To understand the nature of the supernatural entity of ""The Grudge,"" one has to understand Japanese belief in spirits and the supernatural.

In the book ""Ghosts and the Japanese: Cultural Experience in Japanese Death Legends"" by Michiko Iwasaka, there is a passage which is a direct echo of the opening lines of the movie:

""Anyone who dies under great emotional stress creates an energy which is not easily dissipated; these yurei [ghosts], thus, have an impact on the local environment...""

This type of spirit is called a ""goryo"" - vengeful ghost. A goryo, however, is less like a consciously aware ghost that plots revenge like those featured in Kabuki plays and which would be more familiar to Western audiences. A goryo is more like the energy of the emotion created at the time of death. And to some degree it represents the unconscious mind free of the limitations and morals of the conscious analytic side.

Formal belief of goryo can be traced to the Heien Period (794-1185) when goryo were believed to be the angry spirits of political enemies that had died in exile or had been executed. The noted scholar Sugawara-no-Michizane became one such goryo. Through guileful manipulations, his enemies at the Imperial Court engineered his banishment from Kyoto. Sugawara died in extreme sorrow while in exile. Shortly after his death, a number of natural disasters occurred from droughts and epidemics to lightening strikes. It was believed to be caused by the angry spirit of Sugawara. To appease his goryo, Sugawara was given ceremonial promotion at the Imperial Court and eventually he was made into a god-spirit whom modern-day students pray to for success on their exams.

Goryo were vengeful spirits from the aristocracy who like Sugiwara have the power to affect the very seasons. Another more commonly experienced type was onryo. While less powerful than the goryo, the onryo were the ghosts that kept Japanese of then and now frightened out of their wits. Onryo are typically depicted with wild unkempt hair in a white burial kimono.

Although onryo could be either male or female, the most popular onryo were women. Often powerless while in life, these female onryo wielded great power in death. They would wreak vengeance on husbands and lovers who spurned or hurt them in life usually by driving them mad with fear.

Director Takashi Shimizu has built on this old concept to create a deadly onryo of a very frightening ghostly Mother and Son duo. ""The Grudge"" is an American remake of the original Japanese thriller ""Ju-on"" (2003). ""Ju-on"" is Shimizu's horror franchise. ""Ju-on"" grew out of a short TV story to become a successful and scary theater-release movie which was followed by a sequel. Famed Spiderman director, Sam Ramie, who helped produce the American remake thought ""Ju-on"" to be one of the scariest movies he had ever seen.

""The Grudge"" opened in America during the Halloween season last fall but it has only recently opened in Japan. One notable difference is the inclusion of a few extra violent moments that were left out in the American version in order for the movie to keep a PG-13 rating in the States.

Overall there's not much of story. Some people die, then some other people die. Most of the film is just one scare after another with little character development or plot. ""The Grudge"" is more like a series of creepy vignettes strung together to make a film. However, these vignettes are quite scary. Its the cultural nuance of the goryo/onryo-type spirit that ""The Grudge"" represents and the genuinely frightening moments that makes the film an interesting experience for Japan-o-philes and horror fans alike.

On the Scare-O-Meter, ""The Grudge"" rates about 4 out 5 Screams.

On Plot, it rates about 2 stars out of 5; however the concept behind the movie rates about a 4.",3.0
"Well, I saw this movie on Halloween...creepy....

Karen Davis (played by SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR)  is American and living in Japan with her boyfriend, Doug (played by JASON BEHR). Karen volunteers for Alex (TED RAIMI) When not in school, providing care for those confined to their homes. When she is assigned to take the job of Yoko (played by YOKO MAKI), because she didn't show up, Karen is sent to look after Emma Williams (GRACE ZABRISKIE), the elderly, senile mother to transplanted Americans Matthew (played by WILLIAM MAPOTHER) and Susan (played by KaDEE STRICKLAND).

.A series of haunting encounters in the house, disturb Karen, as it appears that anyone who enters will be haunted by the former occupants there or anywhere else they go.

As she tries to get to the bottom of what's occurring in the apparently haunted house, as does local cop Nakagawa (played by RYO ISHIBASHI), she discovers that it might have something to do with American professor Peter Kirk (played by BILL PULLMAN) who purposefully ended his life long before she arrived there.

I won't `ruin' the story from there on, but it only gets wore. This movie had the premise of a great horror, but I think it was poorly developed. I haven't seen the Japanese version, but I'm willing to bet it was better.

My biggest problem wit this movie was the lack of plot. People go into house. People are `cursed'. People die and so on.

There was also one scene in the end where `the grudge' is `crawling' down the stairs. It has a series of twitches and movements attempted to scare you, but I recall thinking MAN THIS IS DUMB.

I will say that this was `scary'. Instead of having the monster lurk behind the corner this moves Shows the monster.

There were `enjoyable' parts, but I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you're a die-hard horror fan.",3.0
"""The Grudge"" offers several minutes of high intensity and suspense, but never delivers the goods of a true horror film.  That is why I wouldn't classify it as one.  A lot of time is spent on the story arc developing, which is rare in a film like this.  While the film's twist is not nearly as satisfying as the superior ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"" offers some genuine spooks and scares for the audience.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is good in a supporting performance, marketed as the lead.",3.0
"I must say I was a little bit disappointed when I saw this movie.  The main story of it was very interesting, but the movie felt incomplete.  It was only about 90 minutes long, which to me is too short for a horror film.  It seems like the main outline for the movie was written, but that was it.  They didn't elaborate the story, so it was too basic.  There is no real character development in the movie, so when it ends, you really don't care that anyone died, because we never really got to know them.  I give this movie 3 stars for an interesting idea, but I just think it could have been much better.",3.0
"I'm curious about why so many reviewers made a point of saying this movie was nothing like The Ring other than the fact that both are Americanized remakes of the Japanese originals. The two films are very similar in that they are both ghost stories...very Japanese ghost stories. In fact, I kind of wish I had seen The Grudge before I saw The Ring because the Grudge (and the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu) explains why both films were so creepy and disturbing.

At the heart of both film's effectiveness is the difference between Western and Eastern ghost tales. In the West, there is almost always some type of redemption: the wicked are punished, the innocent are damaged but wiser, and the ghost is at peace. In Eastern stories, ghosts (at least those of a person who died confused and angry) are always hungry for revenge and can never be at peace. In addition, anyone is fair game no matter how guilty or innocent. One of the shockers in The Ring is the false conclusion where we find out that what we thought put the ghost at peace had no effect at all other than to solve the mystery of how the girl died.

The demons are also very Eastern: not the ugly, leering Christian demons from hell but ones that are unsettling and watchful. More portents of distruction than bringers.

I actually appreciated the restraint with CGI and gore after having seen Exorcist: The Beginning just the night before. Although the thinking behind films these days seems to be that the audience expects lots of gore and special effects (otherwise they won't pay to see the film), I think the over-the-top approach usually detracts from the story as was the case in Exorcist I (which had potential but ended up being an abortion of a movie).

The non-linear approach to telling the story didn't bother me; in fact I enjoyed it because it sustained the mystery. In another inevitable comparison to The Ring, I think The Grudge, is far more satisfying it it's explaination for why the vengeful ghost and why the seemling indiscriminate selection of victims.

One more plus, the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu were a lot more enlightening than the typical gushing sound bites you find on most DVDs. They seemed to have left the over the top superlatives to the American performers.

The movie has some weaknesses which is why I gave it only three stars.

First, the pacing seems glacial: there aren't many extreme emotional events for the first 30 minutes. Even events that seem like they should be disturbing, left me feeling ""why should I care?"" Because Sam Raimi (""Evil Dead"" and ""Spiderman"") isn't exactly the most understated of filmakers, I imagine the quietness and pacing of the film was a deliberate decision. For me, it didn't work.

Second, the lead played by Sarah Michelle Geller, seemed to be not much more than a one-dimensional vehicle for keeping the story moving. If you're expecting Buffy kicking demon ass, you'll need to look at reruns or DVD compilations. Buffy is no where to be found in this movie.

Bottom line: I recommend this movie IF you are open to the fact that it is a Japanese ghost story and with the exception of casting American actors, does little to Westernize the film. If you're expecting The Ring (the Westernized version) you'll be disapointed.",3.0
I JUST HAD TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT REMINDED ME OF ALL THEM OLD JAPANESE MOVIES I GREW UP ON WHILE LIVING IN OKINAWA.  COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MOVIE BUT WHAT THE HECK...I MADE THE BEST HOT BUTTERED POPCORN (FOR ONCE) AND FOR THAT I GAVE IT AN EXTRA STAR!,3.0
"YUK!  I'm still recovering from THAT lonely little jawbone ..... pithy moment though.  ALL very much inspired by ancient Japanese NOH theatre, etc, but very, very effective.

It's almost apint size version of the original 'Haunting' - veguely confusing about 'what really happened' to the original occupants, but BOTH should be seen - the original and the err... remake, or better still a later version dove-tailing everything together?

Wouldn't that be interesting?

By the bye .... people please market a series of games based on these features ""The Grudge"", ""The Ring"" [no one will ever be allowed to leave home...]

Ms. Geller spearheads this one just perfectly!  [Especially the 'shower-moment' ...]

"Why is it that no one in America can make a truly stellar horror flick? Can't anyone come up with an original idea and not have to borrow from past movies (IE- the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre, those awful Jason movies, etc. and the even worse Alien Vs. Predator) and Japanese horror films (The Ring, anyone?)? Alright. All that aside. This is a so so movie. I was scared most of the time, I'll give it that, but I was left disappointed with too many questions floating around in my head. I don't just want to be scared. I crave a great story. A story that begs to be told. This one so does not do this!

Basically, the movie is about a family who moves into a new hosue in Japan. Yes the house is lovely. Yes you must take your shoes off when you enter, even if it is your house. Strange things begin to happen to this family. The mother begins to stare at the wall. Her son is worried and his wife is nervous about living in Japan. The movie moves back and forth between several stories, one of which is this one about the family. The other is about Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, a student who is assigned to visit the seemingly senile mother in this freaky house. I love how Gellar walks toward the house so slowly and looks back and forth like a manic squirrel. She's never been there before. What's there to be afraid of yet? Anyway, she begins to see things too. Soon people end up disappearing. Dying. Seeing little boys who meow. Very strange. What's the deal with this house? What's happening to everyone? What's Bill Pullman jumping out a window in the beginning have to do with the story? It's convoluted, but it's not too hard to follow.

It kinda reminded me of The Ring, just the way it looks and how the tone is. I like The Ring better, though. This movie did scare me. I actually had to stay up and watch Full House just to get it out of my system. Ugh. Some of the images are just horrifying. And imagine having a younger sister who wants to freeze frame them all and stare at them for countless minutes and laugh at you while you squirm. You want a good scare? Check this out. Want to see a great story? Avoid at all costs.",3.0
"I must admit I was rather disappointed by The Grudge. I've watched a lot of horror movies, and The Grudge just didn't strike me as very scary at all - it's creepy enough on occasion to make some viewers jump, but I didn't find anything actually scary about any of it - unless you think Japanese women and little boys wearing black mascara in Tammy Faye proportions is scary. It would have helped if more of the ""scary"" moments hadn't been preceded by an obvious, ridiculously loud crescendo of the music. I wasn't all that impressed with the story, either - it hangs together just fine, but it didn't seem to have much substance. I wouldn't even begin to compare this film with The Ring, which was much, much scarier and emotionally powerful. I have a lot of respect for Japanese horror films, so I'm not blaming any type of cultural differences between Japanese audiences and myself for my dissatisfaction. To me, this film just wasn't nearly as different or original as the filmmakers assert in all of the making-of featurettes. Just because The Grudge serves up a non-linear presentation of the plot and doesn't employ gore to impart its most visceral effects doesn't mean the film is automatically excellent (in the same way that a gory film is not automatically bad just because of the gore). It all comes down to the story, and this just isn't that great of a story.

Sarah Michelle Gellar (who has, by the way, looked better than she does here) stars as a sort-of nurse who has moved to Tokyo with her boyfriend (who, unfortunately, seems to have graduated from the Ashton Kutcher school of fashion). She helps care for infirm patients, and she has to fill in at a certain house one day - while there, she displays an unhealthy curiosity for a series of strange noises, which leads her to a creepy little boy and his fierce cat; before the day is through, she sees something much more frightening than that. Well, it turns out that this particular house was the scene of a violent crime, and the emotional angst that accompanied that terrible event remains in the house, marking for death everyone who dares cross over the threshold. We're soon off on the first of several flashbacks. By the midpoint of the film, it's obvious what is going on here, but that doesn't stop the onslaught of flashbacks. The ending is a little different than what you might expect - but I found it rather unsatisfying (although it does furnish some of the film's creepier - but still not scary - moments).

I just think this movie needed something more, especially at the end; the whole thing felt more like a number of related scenes thrown together than a full-fledged movie. Part of my frustration probably stems from the fact that Gellar's character is absent from a good chunk of the first hour of the film. Gellar seemed really excited about this film in her interviews, but that wonderful Gellar magic seemed bottled up in every one of her scenes. Her whole character never seemed to develop fully - actually, that's a problem with the movie as a whole. I really didn't care about any of these characters, be they innocent or guilty. And I really don't think there is anything complex about the plot - the filmmakers tried to make it seem complicated by the nonlinear storyline, but the final big flashback at the end was almost boring because it wasn't showing me anything I hadn't already figured out. I'm not buying the argument that The Grudge is comparatively deeper or more intellectual than many a good western horror film, either - a film like The Others beats The Grudge hands down, in my opinion.

The movie does come with some 45 minutes of interviews and behind-the-scenes materials, as well as a 12-minute lecture on the psychological nature of fear. There was a little bit of overkill with all this. I got the impression I was expected to love this film just because it was rooted in Japanese culture, made by the Japanese director and film crew of Ju-on, and different than typical Hollywood horror movies. I'm sorry, but as much as I love Sarah Michelle Gellar, The Grudge just didn't impress me all that much.

Who are these people who simply assume that Japanese films in their original Japanese formats won't fly in America? I'm sure Ju-on is a much better film that this Americanized remake - how about slapping some subtitles on the originals and giving American audiences a chance to prove whether or not films like Ringu and Ju-on can fill the seats of American movie houses?",3.0
"I made the mistake of seeing the original Japanese version before seeing the remake and from all the hype about the latter being utterly horrific I was very eager to see it as I thought the original was pretty average.

The remake is not any scarier and I can honestly say I have been more frightened in other movies. I have known people who have seen this and said they were so scared they had their faces covered for most of the film....I don't think so!!",3.0
"First off, I thought this movie was okay. The acting was fine, and the pace of the story kept it from dragging too much. However, the basic idea is, well...stupid. According to the movie, Japan has a superstition that anyone who is murdered and dies in a way that involves great anger or sorrow (which should cover most deaths) ends up killing everyone who enters the house the death occurred in. If this were actually possible, I have to assume the Japanese government/police would have grown wise to this and torn down houses like the one this story focuses on. If you can accept that no one would ever catch on to this bit of the obvious in Japan, then the movie is enjoyable, to a point. This is one of those ""jigsaw"" movies that unfold out of chronological order, so you have to pay attention to the entire second half to understand why this particular story is the one being told. If they make a sequel, I hope they address some of the unanswered questions from this movie. (For instance, is the grudge so strong that the ghost(s) would follow someone back to America? Is there a time limit to how long you have to be in the house to justify being killed, like a plumber addressing a leaky toilet?) The mystery continues...",3.0
"If you ask whether or not 'The Grudge' is really creepy, yes, it is, but I think horror film fans would find the film as a whole is trying to be too clever.  It features American actors but is set in Japan (directed by Japanese Takashi Shimizu), and moreover throws away the usual chronological order to tell the story, very unusual storytelling method in horror films.

With this non-linear approach, the film can be ambitious.  So what you see in the first scene is the most shocking.  You see Bill Pullman staring at the city of Tokyo, from the window of an apartment.  Then, wow, a big surprise comes.

Sara Michelle Geller is nominal star of the film, but the real feature is actually the evil power that must be dwelling in the apparently ordinaly small, Japanese-style house in Tokyo.  It is soon revealed that in that place some terrible incidents happen to the visitors, including Ms. Geller's character Karen, American exchange student, or other people (mostly Americans, including Clea Duvall or Jason Behr as Geller's boyfriend).

[SURELY CREEPY] The film is surely creepy, and the film comes with the carefully controled sound effects (as in 'The Ringu' or 'Ju-On' the latter being the original version of this film).  The atmosphere of Tokyo is captured very well, and the 'lost' sense of American visitors in this city is presented convincingly.  (Incidentally, you can see the same downtown street of Shinjuku, as was seen in 'Lost in Translation'.)

But horror fans would soon realize that director Shimizu uses some conventional scares -- like sudden big noises -- and the film often looks as if too eager to be scary.  In the latter half, the film begins to show its defects -- it is repetitious.  People are killed, or intimidated, by Toshio and Kayako (evil spirits played by the same actors as Japanese versions), but ... it is as if we see too much of them, maybe more than Ms. Geller herself.

[IN A NUTSHELL] the problem is this.  In the beginning of the film, you see THE GRUDGE IS THE CURSE OF THE ONE WHO DIES IN THE GRIP OF POWERFUL RAGE. and that curse is, it says PASSED, LIKE A VIRUS, FROM VICTIM TO VICTIM IN AN ENDLESS, GROWING CHAIN OF HORROR.  Yes, it looks endless, in a bad way.

Perhaps the film's history is more interesting than the Hollywood remake itself.  The original 'Ju-on' and its sequel (shot at the same time) were made-for-video short films.  Then, two theatrical films were made, AND this Hollywood remake.  The franchize spread like a virus.  And they are planning to make another one.  It's time to stop that, isn't it?",3.0
"I thought this movie was pretty good.  I saw it at the theatre with a group of my friends and there were a lot of parts where the movie ""popped"" out at you and made the whole audience jump.  I love that.  It was a great movie to see if you get scared of your closet or noises in your house at night.  I mostly found this movie funny, however, because I tend not to get scared of movies anymore.  I did jump at the ""pop out"" scenes though.",3.0

"I haven't seen Ju-On, but though I generally prefer to start with the original, I figured the experience wasn't likely to differ that much.  Same director, same locations. Same basic story.  And with this version, I get Sarah Michelle Gellar--though a sadder, more chastened Sarah Michelle Gellar I've never seen.  Her character was badly in need of a Prozac through the whole film.  It was like Angel had just gone bad again.

Some people have complained about the disjointed storytelling.  For the most part, this worked fine for me.  It added a level of drama and mystery to the whole thing that we wouldn't have had if the story had been chronological.  We're not only interested in what is happening, but in why.

Unfortunately, the pay-off is not so grand.  The forces that called these onryou--these vengeful spirits--into being are slightly questionable, and the way they function--especially outside the confines of the house--is never clear.

That said, the movie had some creepy atmospherics and a deft hand with the jump scenes.  It didn't haunt me like the best horror movies do.  I watched it at night...in the dark...alone.  And I slept just fine afterwards.  But I had some spine-tingling moments while watching it.  I don't feel compelled to seek out the original as I might have done if this one had blown me away, and I probably won't be going for a second viewing, but it was a decent enough way to spend an hour and a half of my time.",3.0
"""The Grudge"" is moody, atmospheric, and laced with enough scares and disturbing images that most horror fans will probably come away satisfied.  It is NOT, however, fast paced and overly worried about the instant gratification of its audience... you have to sit there and let the cumulative effect of the film wash over you, and THEN you might say, ""wow, that wasn't bad.""  Also, though the movie features much more intelligence and depth than most horror films these days (especially the gore-spattered R-rated offerings in the multi-plexes every few weeks), the story isn't nearly as complex as it initially seems.  Once you see the whole movie and re-construct the timeline in your head in a normal, linear fashion, the movie is actually no more complicated than your average ""Friday the 13th"" entry.  It just tells its simple story better than most other horror movies tell their simple stories.  But there's nothing wrong with that, so, in the end, I say give ""The Grudge"" a whirl.  The DVD has a crisp, clear image and there are generous extras.",3.0
"Atmospheric and at times very spooky, THE GRUDGE is moderately satisfying in achieving this underlying fear and terror without the use of gratuitous violence or blood/gore.  However, it's solemnity is one of its downfalls.  The movie seems longer than it really is and the non-linear editing keeps the storyline confusing, albeit interesting to a point.  Bill Pullman's suicide in the opening sequence goes unexplained for a long time and even when we find out what may have precipitated it, we don't know his true motivation:  guilt or was he compelled to do so because of the house's evil curse?  Sarah Michelle Gellar not only looks anorexic and anemic, but her performance is likewise uninspired.  Her years on Buffy may have convinced her that her presence alone is worth a viewer's interest, but I was really surprised at her lackluster participation.  Jason Behr as her boyfriend Doug seemed to be infected with this apathy as well.  The lighting, sound effects and spook effects were very well done, and as mentioned earlier, there is a sense of menace in some of the scenes.  No where near as frightening as THE RING, I don't think we'll see a GRUDGE 2.",3.0
"First off, I have to admit to having seen the Japanese version of this film, ""Ju-On,"" and comparatively speaking, this Americanized version is similar in many ways but there was definitely something lost in the translation.  I own ""Ju-On"" because, quite honestly, I haven't seen a movie that creepy in a long time.  While the Japanese version has its flaws and low-budget look, the story is broken up into four parts and therefore the film is much easier to follow.  I know for a fact if I hadn't already seen ""Ju-On"" the ""The Grudge"" would have been more than a little confusing with its non-linear plotting and scenes from the first version that are inexplicably left out of ""The Grudge."".  ""The Grudge"" is less effective than ""Ju-On"" for the simple reason that is has a little too much Hollywood in it.  The ending in ""The Grudge"" is Hollywood Horror slop, while the ending in ""Ju-On"" is more ominous and eerie, as if to say ""this evil cannot be stopped no matter what you do or where you hide.""  However, there were some moments in ""The Grudge"" that were chilling and creepy, regardless.  Remember, I've already seen this story twice going in and I just wanted a comparison between the two films.  I still got chills watching ""The Grudge.""  Most of the great sound-effects from the first film are used again here, but there was an over-use of the score which frequently ruined some otherwise scary scenes reducing them to shock-tactics.  For instance, in ""Ju-On"" a young woman enters a quiet room with no music playing in the film when a cat screeches suddenly.  In my head, I was in the room with that character at that moment and I got a thrill without the score giving me notice beforehand.  In ""The Grudge"" the music is used too often at the wrong times to ""enhance"" a scary moment before it even happens and the illusion is weakened.  Another thing about this version that makes little sense is that there certainly seem to be a lot of Americans entering and/or contacting this residence in Tokyo, Japan.  I saw more caucasian characters in this film set in Japan than I saw Japanese characters.  It was certainly admirable of Executive Producer Sam Raimi to try and bring ""Ju-On"" to the American masses; and while ""The Grudge"" does succeed now and again at invoking terror, it does not live up to the original film overall.  In the end, the trappings of Hollywood Horror that are connected to this version make it less interesting to watch than its Japanese counterpart.",3.0
"Remakes have been done time and time again, let's face it. But it seems kind of rare for a film to actually be re-created by the original director and have almost shot-for-shot imagery from the original. And so it is with the Grudge, an american production shot in Japan with the original director of Ju-On, where the source comes from. While it seems kind of creepy, it was kind of bad bordering on stale.

As we're told in the beginning, if a person dies in the grip of a powerful emotion, then it'll bring a curse on whoever comes near and consume them. So in this case, it's a house, anyone who sets foot in a japanese house is basically haunted by these 2 kids: Toshio, a kid who can screech like a cat which borders on irritating than scary and Kayako, a teenage girl who has this weird vocal thing going on.

The story is told very non-linear(chronologically) so we start with the death of a character than go to a character's rendezvous with the curse in the house. Then jump into the past for more people. Then back to present and we actually uncover why the curse started and what drove the first character's death and we also get the end of the present's story at the same time.

As for the ""scares"", they're not really that scary. The best scares always comes when it seems like there's nothing on screen then there is. A lot of these you can actually pinpoint before they happen like the attic scare or the under the covers ones. But in a scene that almost seems straight out of the Ring, one of the girls appears in a surveillance video seemingly coming out of the ground. That was more creepy than it's ""jumps""(although to be honest, when you see the end of the tape, it got ruined for me).

The performances as you can expect are average. Nothing completely inspired but at least they do a good job at getting the images across. Rent it for your date and see if they'll get scared but you'll probably be creeped out less than the date, if they get freaked out at all.",3.0
"Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie the Grudge. I actually was surprised because I thought this movie wouldn't be that good. Yet Gellar actually did not do too bad of a job. But this movie is not neccessarily meant for adults. I mean, the special effects for one thing were not spectacular. Like The Ring, the effects were indeed creepy but not great. The plot is all right but at the end it gets shady, and the ending itself was kind of a cliff- hanger and I'm one of those viewers whom don't like cliff- hanger endings that much. If you start a story, you should end it as well in my opinion. Overall it is meant to be a teen thriller, one that does not have great talent and special effects but of average quality like they use in teen filcks. And there were one or two other questions they wouldn't answer exactly. It wasn't exactly a mature film. But nonetheless I would recommend it for a night when you just want to relax and get creeped out, because indeed you will. So I give it three stars as a fun horror movie, not great, but not at all horrible either.

I don't want to give anything away so I will merely say that The Grudge is about Karen, an exchange student (Gellar) whom is working in Tokyo, Japan as a house nurse to a sick old woman, and soon she figures out there is something wrong with the house. Something very wrong. Go check it out and see what the problem is...it's not a leaky faucet, I can tell you that much.",3.0

"Above and beyond all genres of film, horror takes the cake for me.  So when I heard about ""The Grudge"", how it was yet another version of ""The Ring"" (which ""Ju-On also was), I was prepared to vomit, yes.

This went beyond my expectations and had some genuinely frightening moments--no thanks to the lead performances of ""who again?"" Hollywood nonentities like Sarah Michelle Gellar or Bill Pullman.  Not even frightening moments exactly, frightening sequences, like when Matthew's sister is essentially tortured psychologically till she's sucked under the bed by that blue chick who crawls like she's really angry and really handicapped.

This is a scary movie to a considerable degree.  Yeah, it's derivative, and yeah, they use the blue chick too much.  But there are some scary moments, and like the other reviewer said, it beats crap like Seed of Chucky.  Worth a rental.",3.0
"The grudge is the American remake of the Japanese movie Ju-On and like most remakes it isn't as good. The movie does have several good qualities to it. It is easier to follow than Ju-On and it is easier to keep track of who are the characters. It doesn't have the same creepy feel to it that Ju-On had and some of the jumps come off as comical instead of scary. There are a couple of good scenes that will make you jump in your seat, and it isn't a waste of money to rent or even buy it. Sarah Michelle Gellar is good in the movie, but nothing to write home about. Overall, I would say that if you haven't seen Ju-On then you will like the Grudge. If you have seen Ju-On, then the movie seems more like a pale comparison rather than original. It is a fun movie and not as violent as Ju-On, which I believe was rated R, but it never really gets into your head the way Ju-On managed to creep you out. If you compare it to The Ring (another American remake), it doesn't stand too well because The Ring was able to live up to the original. Still, I would recommend the movie if you want something to watch late at night, with the doors locked and a big bowl of popcorn. It is worth renting while Ju-On is worth buying.",3.0
"Having seen ""The Grudge"" in its ""theatrical release,"" I immediately played this DVD with the overlapping ""commentary"" feature because I wanted to hear the participants' input.  Towards the end, Sam Raimi reveals that a ""director's cut"" may/will be released a couple of months after this initial release.  That not-here version will apparently include 3 more minutes of horror, shock, and gore, but will delete the rooftop scene in which the main detective explains to Sarah Michelle Gellar's character the mystical/spiritual basis for what's happening.  We are told that the detective's explanation, which isn't all that complicated or helpful anyway, would be superfluous to the Japanese audience, which is (say the cast and crew) already accustomed to...well, actually I wonder.  Am I to understand that EVERYONE in Japan expects that when an awful murder happens in a house, future residents should expect to be killed by their ghosts?  No wonder the realtor in this movie kept quiet about the dysfunctional bathtub.

Anyway, if you're wild about this movie you may want to hold out for a couple of months before buying this version.  I went for a certain national chain's promotion and got this DVD along with the Japanese version, ""Ju-On,"" as a package deal.  I haven't watched that yet, but Sam, Sarah, and company said that the rooftop scene isn't in ""Ju-On"" either.

Clearly I also disagree with Roger Ebert's one-star lambasting of ""The Grudge,"" not only because I am a big fan of Ms. Gellar but because I found the pacing, camera shots, sets, and the music appropriately chilling.  For me, the nonsequential depiction of some events effectively built the suspense.  I usually agree with Roger, but I don't understand why he thought the plot didn't tie together.  (He also complained about the preponderance of hair dangling throughout the movie.  That gave me something else to watch for, a little inside joke with myself while the rest of the audience was gasping and screaming.)

If you can accept the admittedly suspect premise that ""[w]hen someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is left behind"" (it's on the box; I didn't memorize it, whattaya think, I'm a fanatic?)...oh, and you like lots of mysterious ghoulish death, you will enjoy ""The Grudge.""",3.0
"its only fair by comparing to ""the ring"". ""the ring"" is more of an ""action package"", it has a decent linear story line. This one plays nonlinearly which is just like other people would discribe it, a serie of events played side by side. Be honest, I've seen a bunch of these movies and they hardly concentrate my emotion into one. It's the kindda question u ask yourself whether 1+1+1=3, does simple math really work that way in cinematics. The scary moments appears on and on occasionally, but they've ordered in a way at the end I would feel like what I've been watched are a bunch creepy clips with special effect that don't necessary lined up together. I've watched the original on DVD when it comes out first before this one. I didn't even like the original, this one's actually better in terms of technical achievement. What I think is the writer really sold out after the success of the massive first hit of ""the ring"" (second note, the ring 2 original isn't any better than the first either), sadly, but I guess its too much to ask the same person to be brilliant twice if not even more.",3.0

Every movement of feet on the stage can be heard.  Musically, I feel the performance is adequate -- not great, but not bad either.  I was most disappointed in the acting and dramatic delivery of the singers.  I found the acting to be very one-dimensional (especially Kaibaivanska as Butterfly), flat, and lacking in emotion.

"Few philosophers are renowned for their guidance in military tactics or their competence as men of the battlefield. Considering that such men excel in the art of brutal killing, they seem an odd category of people to recommend to the masses the right methods of life. A large part of the population have for long wisdom of such men, Niccol Machiavelli and Sun Tzu springing readily to mind, as they are seen as playing the devil's advocate for the cruel rulers they guide. However demented or wise these men may be, they without doubt shaped the political and social structure of their government and their influence has carried on even to our era. Among such men, the case of the protagonist of Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is an unusual one; a ronin-a samurai without a Lord or House to serve-as the political and military philosopher. His text on military strategy, The Book of Five Rings, is still being read and scrutinized in many areas, from philosophy to business.

A famed swordsman, Musashi Miyamoto, was an unbeatable warrior whose legacy carries on as one of the most rebellious and intriguing men of his time. Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is the first segment of a trilogy of films depicting Musashi's life; as it is the first segment it focuses on his early exploits to become a samurai. Following the loss of his side at the Battle of Sekigahara, he takes refugee with his fellow friend, Honiden Matahachi, at the house of a widow and her daughter. The daughter and widow fall in love with Musashi due to his swordsmanship that kills, injures, and scares of a large portion of the ronin that demands favors such as money, food, jewelry-especially Gold-to leave them unharmed. He rejects both women while Matahachi attaches himself to the women, even though he has promised to return to his faithful fianc. Angered by this event, Musashi returns to his village to inform Matahachi's mother and fianc of his whereabouts.
As in many other classic Samurai films,  Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto contains great acting, by the likes of no other than Toshiro Mifune, an able director, and carefully chosen settings. Even with all the good performances and genuinely fine screenplay, based on a contemporary Japanese novel of Musashi's life, the film is ultimately forgettable. Undeniably, the film simply aims at describing Musashi's earliest years, but in turn creates a work that could only interest fans of Musashi Myamoto rather than the average filmgoer. What really drains the film is the lack of comprehension of Musashi's true talent and vigor; on the surface he seems indistinguishable from countless samurai of other samurai flicks. Granted that he may be a shallow samurai, no insight or philosophy is assigned to character. It is quite unexplained why he hates the village and its inhabitants as much as he does. Without some insight about the true significance of Musashi, the audience of the film will be more confused at the significance of this character that seems to lack any significant characteristic worth caring for.

Strangely, the film succeeds in making Musashi look like a complete loon and fool, and not a believable one. In the hunt that ensues, he succeeds in overpowering nearly everyone, but surrenders himself to the Priest with no opposition; it is not the surrender that is strange, but the method of surrender which is so spiritless and uncharacteristic of the samurai character that Musashi so eagerly demands to achieve. If that wasn't enough, Musashi is deceived a second time by the Priest who caused him so much suffering and humiliation. Unfortunately, the story line may be believable and acceptable in the novel that the film is based on, but many of the film's developments seem to embarrassingly display the filmmaker's inability of giving the work an acceptable ending.

Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is insignificant not because Musashi's himself is not interesting for the contemporary viewer, far from it, but because he is utterly identical to every other samurai you have seen. As it is shown, he is a great swordsman, but, then again, are not all samurai? As much as Toshiro Mifune attempts to show us the rebellious, and eventual moral character, of Musashi we are at a loss, because the script is so thinly developed that even the noblest efforts of the entire cast combined can not make the film the great picture that it truly deserves to be. Surprisingly, Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto was presented with Academy  Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 28th (1955) Oscars; however, odd a selection this may be, it is not nearly as strange why the following two segment of the trilogy were devoid of such honors.",3.0
Not as good as the critics would have you think.  And that ending......,3.0
"Having seen ""Sorcerer"" back when I was a teen/young adult, (which I remember to this day as being an ""edge of your seat-er"" interesting & good  movie), I decided to try to get this movie after reading all the terrific & raving reviews about this ""original"" version. So on the reviews & advice of others here, I spent the time & money to finally get it.

After watching it however, all I can say is that whoever thought this was good, must have seen it as a very young child & remembered it a lot better than it actually was. (I can't wait until the revamped ""Sorcerer"" Blu-ray comes out in a few months, so I can see if it is as good as I remember it, or is just as bad as this movie/version was! (I suppose it is possible my childhood memory of Sorcerer is as ""Off"" as other people's memory of this movie was!)

Bottom line, my recommendation... don't bother seeing this version. While interesting to see movies & places from so long ago, it isn't enough to make it worth sitting thru this. The only character you like will be killed off, & the others will do things throughout the movie that make you realize that their dying & being killed off is simply justice. And if their cruelty towards others is not enough, their blatant stupidity & ignorant actions merits their being removed from the gene-pool!
In short, having risked everything, used others & treated them like garbage & made it thru horrific, life threatening events, the main character gets so overwhelmed with his survival & reward, that he gets reckless & just drives off a cliff!
NOT the plot of a great movie.

Watch for a future review of Sorcerer someday. When I am able to watch it again & check to see if I remembered that movie correctly, or decide to add it to this one, of the ""don't bother seeing"" group.
Sorry to be so harsh about this one, but it was NOT as good as it could have been, & certainly NOT as good as people here claim it is.

For one thing, with the horrible way the main characters treat others, I end up not caring if they live or die, as I begin to feel they deserve to die! Also, in the movie's climatic tense moments, like when taking horrible risks to maneuver the trucks thru an area that is supposed to be hard to get thru, it was blatantly obvious that they could easily fit thru the area without any risk at all! Even my wife asked ""What is wrong with these guys? What is so hard about making that corner, as there is enough room for even me to do it!""
And then when success is finally had, the idiot has a death wish! Making the whole trip (& movie) for nothing! (It was even hard to be concerned about him making it back to the ""bar-girl"" whom he didn't even care about in the first place!",3.0
"The always-reliable Toshiro Mifune plays a wild young man with a strong urge to go off and fight in a local civil war.  He goes, the war doesn't turn out well, and the young man Takezo (the Mifune character) ventured off with takes up with a prairie floozy and her beautiful daughter and promptly forgets all about the girl he left behind. Takezo doesn't, though, and when he returns to the village to tell Otsu of the betrayal by some prestidigitation or other he finds himself hunted by the villagers on trumped up charges of treason and proceed to hunt our young hero like a swamp dog.

 Then or thereabouts a Buddhist priest enters the story and becomes the pivot point in the first installment in an epic trilogy.  Will the priest prove able to break Takezo's stubborn willfulness without breaking his spirit?  MIYAMOTO MUSASHI is released by Criterion and won an honorary, foreign language Academy Award in 1955.  That's a pretty potent combination that's hard to resist, and I stuck this one in the player figuring maybe it is, as some have claimed, the Japanese `Gone With the Wind.'

 Then I remembered I'm not all that partial to GWTW, either.  Well, the `either' came after I watched MM and decided its `classic' elements eluded me.  For one thing, its afflicted with first-installment-itis - it takes a whole long time for the plot to pick up momentum, and the ending has the always frustrating `to be continued' written all over it. Not only is it somewhat slow and choppy and inconclusive, its centerpiece - a climatic battle between Takezo and a forest full of angry men with long, pointy sticks - is a fizzle. It either wasn't choreographed well before filming, or the editors botched it in the cutting room, or the director didn't film enough footage for the editor to use in the first place.  In any event, what ought to be a stirring, pitched battle is nothing much more than Toshiro Mifune hopping and snarling and spitting at a herd of extras who don't come within fifteen feet of him.

 MIYAMOTO MUSASHI was good enough for me to recommend, just, and intriguing enough to line up a viewing of the final two installments.  Kind of a mucky, dirty, hard-to-read print as well.",3.0
"It is easy to overrate certain films, and this is one of them.  Certain films, like this one, have a lot of status for some reason.  This is not a great film.  The story isn't absorbing enough.  There are some other faults as well.

The battle scenes are unbelievable.  A number of times we have one solitary fighter, either Takezo or his friend, beating off a large number of attackers.  The way this is accomplished is by showing the hero spinning around, and every time he swings his sword, someone else falls.  It is absurd.  The men fell, in turn, because the script told them to.  There is no realism in any of the battle scenes.

We also don't understand why the characters behave as they do.  We just have to chalk it up to Japanese culture, or whatever.  They make no sense as real people.  Why did the priest treat Takezo as he did?  Ya got me!  Why did Takezo make the final decision he made?  Ya got me again.  I don't feel it.

In one scene, darling Otsu tells Takezo to wait for him, and she disappears to change her clothes.  Obviously he was going to walk out on her.  I thought Otsu was an absolute idiot for walking away to change her clothes, after begging him to let her accompany him.  Do you think he stayed and waited for her?  How foolish was that scene.

It is a fairly absorbing story, but not nearly as absorbing as the book Musashi.  I can't give this film more than 3 stars.

One thing that annoys me in Amazon reviews is how often people say ""the movie was great but the dvd was bad"".  It is a cliche already.  Rate the movie.  When you are talking about a classic like this one, the only permissible way to criticize it is by saying the movie is great but the dvd is bad.  Well, this movie isn't great.  It's pretty good.  That's it.",3.0
"I must admit I'm always a tad suspicious of any foreign movie that gets the artsy critics all excited.  However, I tried to approach The Wages of Fear with an open mind, since I like some of Clouzot's other movies, such as Diabolique.  Critics rave about how suspenseful The Wages of Fear is.  Hardly.  Certainly the premise - four losers driving two truckloads of nitroglycerin across a treacherous mountain road - looks promising, but the moments of suspense are few, and frankly there is more nail-biting suspense in a movie like Speed than in this flick.  On top of that, the movie spends more than an hour setting up the plot, with lots of little episodes showing that the four losers are, yep, real sleazebags, and what's more fun than spending two hours of your life with four sleazebags?

However, I must admit the movie weaves its own kind of spell.  It was possible to forget I was watching actors, as the movie gives the impression that this dirty little El Podunco town in South America really does exist, and that these low-lifes are real people, with real dirt and sweat clinging to them.  The four main actors are quite good, especially Charles Vanel as an aging gangster who still tries to hold on to his pride and arrogance even though he knows he is well past his prime (and a coward to boot).  Yves Montand is good as the cocky Mario, and his long and tense ride in the truck with Vanel shows the two men alternately liking and hating each other.  I wish the two other characters, one Dutch, one Italian, were more fully developed, as they seem more likable than Montand and Vanel, but Clouzot seemed determined to focus on the nasty and not the nice.  Clouzot's wife Vera gives a good performance as a pushed-around yet spunky cafe worker who tries to find a little joy in this hellhole.  On the other hand, the American characters - all employees of an oil company (boo, hiss) - are like capitalist caricatures from some really bad Soviet propaganda movie from this period.  The director apparently wants us to like the multi-ethnic people in this fleabag town, but he clearly despises American capitalists, whom he depicts as corrupt and insensitive.  (I read somewhere that, when the movie was first released in America in the 1950s, some of these anti-American scenes had been deleted.  Too bad they put them on the DVD, as they add nothing to the story.)

I wouldn't dream of giving away the ending, except to say that any French movie from the 1950s is bound to be a downer, since the French elites were all caught up in existentialism, that really profound and life-enhancing philosophy, which can be summed up as ""Life's a b*tch and then you die.""

Not an ""up"" movie, and not all that suspenseful, but it isn't dull, and if you can overlook the nasty caricatures of Americans, the acting is quite good.",3.0
"As I have heard, this film is first in a trilogy that is a landmark in Japanese cinema.  This first installment is pretty slowpaced and the sword fights unimpressive. The motives of the Buddhist monk is not clear nor is the reasons for Mifune's character's decision at the end of the film.  I'm sure it would have the emotional impact it deserves if these threads of sense were woven in.  Well, until I see the other two, I won't be able to make much sense of the first movie which on the whole seems like a downer.  usally there is some build to a catharsis but the expected one here seems anticlimatic because the moment is understated without plot.  This is a commonality among Western interpretations of Japanese cinema to imply understatement but here it is really evident.  Instead of ""flowing like calligraphy"" the plot is predictable and the scene changes often seemingly random.  I'll post reviews when I see the other two but for now all I can say is don't see just one of the films.  There were intended to be together so watch them together.  This way, one won't run into the same confusion as this reviewer did.",3.0
"Although the cinematography, locations, and costumes were all first rate,  I found this to be more of a samurai soap opera than a samurai epic.  I  know, I know,...this trilogy may seem slow to unenlightened individual's  who can't appreciate its depiction of the spiritual struggle of the  samurai.  Hogwash.  Mifune's performance is wooden, the script is overly  melodramatic, and the storyline and direction are okay at best.  The female  lead characters are depicted as pathetic whiners whose lives aren't worth  living without a man by their side.  This whining begins early in Samurai  I, and continues until the end of Samurai III.  I found Samurai II to  contain the best action sequences, and I consider it to be the best film of  the trilogy.
Inagaki's trilogy isn't even in the same league with  Kurosawa's samurai films.  Don't buy Inagaki's trilogy until you've  experienced Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"", ""The Hidden  Fortress"", ""Yojimbo"", and ""Sanjuro"".",3.0
"Although this is a good movie, it is a very overrated movie. No matter what movie forum you visit you will always see this film averaging around five stars, and (in my opinion) it just doesn't warrant that level of praise. This is just a theory, but I have a suspicion that old movies that have been deemed ""classics"" get a much more benevolent treatment when it comes to reviews. Perhaps this may be due to nostalgia. I'm not bashing old movies in general. In fact, many old movies appear on my Top 100 Films list (Billy Budd, Fail Safe, Psycho, Ben Hur, It's A Wonderful Life, Zorba The Greek, The Virgin Spring, etc.) But like the vast majority of older movies, this film has acting that is way over the top (overacting) and dialog that is totally cornball. Some may rightly enjoy this campiness. I don't. Another distracting thing about this film is that there are plot sequences (particularly relating to their trek with the explosives cargo) that were simply illogical and seemed to be capriciously thrown in so as to create a foundation for a thrill/action scene. The films cinematography and art direction are wonderful and that's what will stand out in my memory of this film.

"Sometimes, a good movie is the victim of inordinate amounts of praise and accolades by people who think it would be ""uncool"" of them to say anything negative.  Heaven forbid these in-crowd wannabes would say  anything to break from the pack.  So, instead, they pile on the  superlatives to the point of no return.  As a result, new audiences end up  feeling extremely disappointed when they finally do see the film because  there's no way it can live up to the high expectations these reviewers have  given it.
Well, I'm not one of those, so I'll say it like it is:  ""Wages Of Fear"" is a *very* good movie, but it's far from being  THE suspense movie to end all suspense movies as some here would have you  believe.  The newly-restored director's cut clocks in at a whopping 148  minutes, of which the first 46 minutes go by very s-l-o-w-l-y.  The  characters are being set up and developed during this time, but some of it  does drag and even then there are some unanswered questions as to who,  what, where, and why.
It's easy to see why parts of this film were  censored for its US release back in 1954: the picture that Clouzot paints  of American corporations and their heartless greed is not pretty indeed.  Even today, the dialog used by the oil-company foreman in his decision to  use non-union workers stings and shocks.
The story's pace picks up once  our four main characters get on the road with their charge of nitro.  Most  of the action is completely unexpected (a very good thing), some of it is  boringly obvious (not so good thing), and a bit here and there just isn't  explained very well (a bad thing).  Bimba and Luigi are believable as  characters and they endear themselves to the viewer immediately.  You just  love these guys.  Jo and Mario, however, are the complete opposite.  Jo's  breakdown, fully plausible as a result of what they have to go through, is  a bit too sudden and too early in the trip and renders his character  uninteresting --except for the scene at the gushing pipeline where your  heart will break because of what happens to him.  Mario's selfishness  causes him to do the unthinkable to get his nitro through, but it is this  scene that is the most powerful of the entire movie and which will have you  staring at your screen in complete shock.
Without revealing anything, I  found Mario's behavior at the end to be completely unbelievable and  out-of-character and the story ended much too abuptly (did they run out of  film?).  A very disappointing end to such a good movie.
The Criterion  edition is bare-bones: no trailer, no dubbed audio track, no interview,  nothing.  There are English subtitles, but they are not all that accurate.  The film has been remastered so it's clear, except for a vertical white  line that appears on and off for what seems to be the major part of the  film.  It's not all that obtrusive, but considering this is a Criterion  release it's surprising it's there at all!
I give this 3 stars:  4  stars for the film (despite its several flaws, it is engaging and  suspenseful and well worth owning) minus 1 star for the poor bare-bones  Criterion edition (with a ... list price, you'd think they could give  more).",3.0

"A beautiful film, of almost unmatched poetry and marvellous pictures, no question about that. Nevertheless: I saw it twice with a distance of ten years, and both times I was not convinced by the main theme - the love story. I cannot see or understand why these two are supposedly falling in love, Monsieur Cocteau, I'm sorry. The characters do not move me: the beast spies on the beauty in her room and tells her lies, the beauty is in love with the family friend Avenant, although as a viewer you see right away that he is reckless and cold. Also, I found the final explanation for the beast's curse far-fetched and implausible.

I guess what makes this film is not logic but the unique storytelling, all right. And I know that I am now probably earning the reputation of an ignorant who has no idea what good films are, but be that as it may, it's my personal point of view. To someone who wants to see an also, in its own way, beautifully told version of this fairy tale, where the characters are not cardboard cut-outs but original and their feelings for one another credible, I recommend the Disney version of the year 1990. And no, I didn't dislike this film because I am Disney biased, I had seen the Cocteau film version for the first time long before the Disney version came out.",3.0

"I have to admit that I find the acting styles of the French and Italian stars quite wooden and stiff. That said, it does not include Signoret, Montand, Loren and Deneuve....

But here it does! While the scenes, costumes and other production values are an inspiration and a treasure to behold; it still is cold and lifeless...  The Beast hisses ""Belle"" so many times that I could explode and in this case should have been a mute...

"La Belle et la Bte (Jean Cocteau, 1946)

You know the story, of course. Belle (Josette Day), the neglected and beautiful younger sister of two wastrel women, once noble but now in somewhat dire straits, goes to the castle of the Beast (Jean Marais) to pay a blood debt invoked by her father. The Beast, however, doesn't kill the girl, but ends up falling in love with her. Then the kiss, and the handsome prince revealed, and all that. You've seen the Disney version.

Don't let that fool you. Disney, as you probably know, oversimplifies everything, and when you put a fairy tale in the hands of a wonderful director like Jean Cocteau, you're going to get a much finer film. And while this is certainly not a perfect film, it does put paid to the puling mediocrity (with the catchy tunes) Disney cranked out.

Day plays a wonderfully nuanced Belle. She's far from the goody-two-shoes Disney portrays Belle as, a woman whose servitude to her two sisters has hardened her. As well it should have. She is honest, somewhat tactless, and a much harder heroine to mindlessly identify with. Her father sees her as a paragon of goodness, but really, if your two other daughters were like these two, who wouldn't? Marais as the Beast, however, is a bit more problematic. I grant you, a lot of the reason for this is that the film's makeup artist made the Beast look more like a teddy bear than The Wolf Man's Lon Chaney. Now, you and I both know the Beast is supposed to be a tragic figure, but really, making his fangs uneven and carefully coiffing his hairdo? The argument could be made that it went with his wonderfully stylized costuming, but were that the case, why couldn't he just kidnap a dentist and have some work done on that left fang? His delivery is somewhat stilted most of the time, but I'm willing to put that down to the difficulty of enunciating through what must have been pounds of makeup.

The film's ninety-three minutes also gives us less time than we really need to see the developing relationship between Belle and the Beast. With all the fairy tale's subplots needing to grab screen time as well (and Cocteau is almost lavishly faithful to the intricacy of the fairy tale), the centerpiece of the story gets oddly short shrift. Belle goes from abrupt dismissal to wanting to be the Beast's friend in a matter of frames. As the film goes on, things get a little smoother, but those first encounters between the two of them do jar.

The reason to watch this film, though, as with any Cocteau film, is the wonderful stylization in the sets. The Beast's castle is a wonder of disembodied arms as servants, busts that swivel their heads to follow characters' movements, magic mirrors, and the like. Cocteau wants to use the frame of the story to deliver a visual feast, and he delivers. The juxtaposition of the sunny town where Belle's family lives, which is your basic peasant town, and the Beast's sumptuous, but dark, castle is wonderfully done. Cocteau began his artistic life as a painter, and it shows in his set design.

La Belle et la Bte ends up being more a visual feast than a compelling story, but it's still worth watching after all these years. Fun and enjoyable. ***",3.0
"I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I preferred the animated Disney version of this story to the 1946 Jean Cocteau film.  I'm no Disney fan, and I would personally like to stop them from taking over the world (along with Starbucks), but this is one case where I just thought they instilled this fairy tale with more magic.  I missed the character of Gaston in the Cocteau version, and I missed also the delightful assortment of animated objects.  And I think this story is particularly conducive to being set to music, and I enjoyed the songs in the Disney version.
However, on its own terms, the 1946 release is well done, and considered by many to be the definitive version of the beauty/beast tale.  I thought the acting was bland, though Belle is indeed a beauty.  And there are moments of pure movie magic: the candelabras that light Belle's way, the fireplace that watches her father eat.  And for once slow motion is used in a way that doesn't feel cliche.  But the relationship between Belle and the Beast isn't well developed.  You don't see Belle falling in love with him over the course of the film, and when she professes her love at the end, it seems to come out of thin air.  And was I the only one confused by the transformation at the end?  It doesn't get explained well at all.  Though it is kind of funny at how blase Belle is when the Beast becomes a hunk and says she'll have to get used to his new face.
The film is interesting in that it acknowledges the Beast's animalistic nature.  He hunts wild game, he craves blood, and more than once you wonder whether or not he'd rather eat Belle than court her.  There's a violent eroticism underlying this film, that I found surprising for the year it was released.
I know Cocteau asks his audience at the film's beginning to watch the film with the eyes of a child and to give itself over to the enchantment of fairy tales, and I have no problem doing that.  But even so, I felt like he was using fairy tale logic to explain away things that could have been explained better.

"Yes I looked forward to the new Criterion remastering and it does have some wonderful things - two commentaries, interviews and other information. But the new sound in Dolby is disastrous. It's harsh and metallic. I pulled out Criterions original issue of this film and the sound is full and rich with no problems except some slight cramping typical of French sound in the 40s. Criterion should get rid of the new soundtrack and put back the older one - it's shame so many good things were ruined - didn't anyone listen to the sound before issuing it????",3.0

The film does look pristine, but the depth of the original is missing.  It almost looks too squeaky clean and...well, digital.

When you have to constantly read the subtitles its hard to actually enjoy the movie.  It was going at a fast pace.  This is why I give this DVD 3 stars intead of 5 stars.

"I saw ""For All Mankind"" in its IMAX incarnation at the Smithsonian. I hate to be a party pooper, but it struck me as more a NASA marketing piece than the awesome piece of space trip I had expected.  Admittedly, I am biassed, having seen Spaceborne many years ago. The latter  was a short assembled from public-domain footage, and had a much more  spontaneous, closer-to-the-moment feeling than ""For All Mankind"".  Still, space footage is space footage: hard to screw it up, especially with  a score by Brian Eno. If only Criterion had included Spaceborne (otherwise  unavailable) on this disk.",3.0
"""For All Mankind"" contains some amazing footage from the Apollo expeditions and narration from some of the astronauts. There are many great scenes, but the film as a whole suffers greatly from the fact that they've combined material from several different trips into one narrative and most of the time we're not sure what we're looking at or who's talking about which Apollo expedition. For me, this took out a lot of enjoyment of the movie, which is a pity because there are some great sequences. Personally, I liked the similar but more recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Shadow-of-the-Moon/dp/B000XJ5TPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Shadow of the Moon</a>&nbsp;better than For All Mankind.",3.0
"The Apollo program through the cameras the astronauts took with them, as well as through cameras in the control room at Houston. It's interesting, but in the process of finding a picture of the DVD cover, I came across another I'm going to have to find, called ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" from 2007 directed by Ron Howard. I suspect (especially from the trailer) that it is going to be better.

This is mostly the raw film, with all its flaws, and you don't always know what you are looking at. Indeed, I spent a good bit of the time while they were on the moon trying to figure where the camera was that was taking the picture. It turns out they have mashed together several trips, and so while there were only two astronauts on the surface in Apollo 8 (or was that 9?), there were more later, and there were cameras on the rover (which trip had the rover and went up to a ridge at a considerable distance from the lander?), and all together this was pretty confusing. Interesting, but confusing.",3.0
"An aspect of this film that lends it uniqueness, is that it is, in a sense, a pure documentary- just the images and words of those involved. It has no political nor philosophical; agenda. Too much agitprop has infected documentaries of recent years. A Certain Kind Of Death is perhaps the only recent documentary I can think of that trusts its audience to this extent. Susan Korda, the film's editor, also deserves notice. It is truly rare that in any film (fictive or documentary) editing plays such a key role, but this is one, and it is not in the length of the particular scenes and how they are edited, but in which images and scenes are in the film, and what other ones (and words- culled from hours of astronaut interviews) they are juxtaposed with. A really great job, and not a wasted second in the film, right from the opening shot of President John F. Kennedy's tossing down of the gauntlet in a speech at Baylor University to the final shots of the missions in flight. Brian Eno's score is also noteworthy.

  Of course, the only negative thing concerning this film is nothing of its own doing; it is the waste of decades since. Cernan, in the commentary, speaks of sometimes feeling that President Kennedy actually reached into this century, and forcefully willed NASA to the moon decades ahead of time, and I am forced to agree. The tepidity of the public to intellectual and artistic pursuits is only emphasized by witnessing folk, from not too long ago, who treated such ideas as ideals to be cherished and nourished, not dismissed. The moon landing is one of those rare instances where a single act literally changed mankind's view of itself, yet, it did not change enough of it to fundamentally better us all. That fault is society's, not the men and women who achieved this monumental thing. And hats off to Al Reinert for taking up a task even NASA did not feel a need doing, and doing it so well. Simply put, whether a fan of Criterion, documentaries, history, or science, this DVD is one of the few essential films to treasure and explore. If only those political hacks who fund NASA understood exploration and the value of knowledge, perhaps we'd already have had our Martian Apollos and Armstrong.

"I am sorry to say that despite the fine remastering, I was disappointed to see they retained the 4:3 ratio - I am sure it could be argued that any cropping to bring the image to full screen size would diminish the piece as well.  This was not a documentary in the strictest sense of the word, as it was a mish-mash of all the missions assembled into a somewhat logical, though inaccurate order.  The overlaid commentary that described the specifics of the technology was 'treated' to blend in with the actual voice transmissions, which I found distracting and misleading.  I think the best way to handle this material would have to been to shift the footage to the left or right and use the remaining screen-space to describe mission number, objectives, crew and other details and any narrative should have been done differently.  Keeping all of this in mind, if you are willing to put up with the issues I describe above, go ahead and get it.",3.0
"Containing eighty minutes of amazing footage from Apollo missions to the moon, this newly restored high-definition digital transfer, from producer -director Al Reinert, takes an already amazing product, and makes it look and sound better.  From Criterion Collection, this new release hit shelves on July 14th, and is sure to wow those interested in the footage of trips to the moon.

Reinert has done a remarkable job of gathering often never before seen footage of the adventures of the twenty-four astronauts who travelled to the moon.  Combining said footage with an enchanting sound track by Brian Eno makes for an interesting look at some exciting footage.

Though Reinert may be a fine documentarian, he fails as a storyteller in this outing.  By combining all the footage into a single trip to the moon, he confuses the audience as they try to determine whose voice is being heard, and why the faces continue to change.  Once the film has ended, and some of the bonus material is viewed, you get a better idea of the goal, and the optional on-screen identifications do help, but it is not the combining of footage into one story that is the true tragedy in storytelling here.  The omission of information regarding the return from the moon, re-entry, splash down, and simple questions such as; what is it like when that hatch is opened for the first time back on earth, or what is it like to step foot on earth again?  It's somewhat laughable that in the bonus feature ""An Accidental Gift: The Making of: For All Mankind"" Reinert explains his reasoning for not telling the entire story, as he states that he felt the return was anti-climactic.  Actually, it is the definition of climactic, and completely necessary to this tale.

Other bonus features include: Audio commentary featuring Reinert and Apollo 17 commander Eugene A. Cernan, the last man to set foot on the Moon, On Camera, a collection of excerpted, on-screen interviews with fifteen of the Apollo astronauts, A short piece on astronaut Alan Bean and his artwork, NASA audio highlights and liftoff footage, and A booklet featuring essays by film critic Terrence Rafferty and Reinert.  In many cases the bonus material helps to round out the feature.

There is no question that the footage in this release is spectacular, but combining the footage with the interviews found in the bonus material, and allowing the footage to stand on its own rather than trying to combine it into one trip to the moon, would have made for a better viewing experience.  The addition of the experiences of the astronauts on the return from the moon, are crucial to rounding out this project.

Recommendation:  Great piece of history that makes for an educational and entertaining viewing experience, especially for those too young to remember the events.  Could have and should have been a more complete piece of storytelling.",3.0
"I ordered the Blu-Ray version of this video based on the positive reviews here on Amazon.

Mixed bag. Some parts were interesting, others left me wanting to reach for the fast forward on my remote. Specifically:

The Good -- Apollo 11 landing video was amazing, best I've ever seen. Surface operations video was excellent as well, some I'd never seen. DOES benefit from the higher resolution of Blu-Ray in places.

The Bad -- WAY too much time and video of astronauts horsing around for the camera in route to the Moon and talking about their feelings and the ""vastness of space"". Like some type of encounter session or something. I want interviews with engineers, talk about mission planning, details on computing systems, science operations carried out on the lunar surface, etc. None of that was provided. Also -- portions of the NASA video had some sort of grainy, ""artsy"" effect added to it that served no purpose whatsoever and ruined those segments for me.

Interesting video overall and somewhat worth the purchase but I wish I had looked around more.",3.0
"I guess it depends on how much footage of the Apollo missions you want to watch, but you get decidedly more viewing pleasure for the buck with the HBO series, From the Earth to the Moon - The Signature Edition, which also had unlimited access to NASA in making this documentary -- 720 minutes as opposed to 79 minutes plus whatever extras Criterion tossed in. For All Mankind is visually appealling but it doesn't give you anywhere near the depth of information that the HBO series provides, plus it loses much of its appeal on the small screen.",3.0
"This DVD is nearly twice as expensive as the outstanding ""Nova-To The Moon"" DVD, yet it falls far short of what a true documentary should be. My main complaint is the liberty Producer/Director Al Reinert takes editing video and especially audio into single sequences when they clearly come from multiple sources. The effect is jarring and unpleasant, in direct contrast to the new age musical noodling of Brian Eno.
Yes, the cinematography is great, but it is certainly no better than other commonly available documentaries, as it is after all almost 100 percent 30 year old NASA footage, which is largely common to all the available documentaries.
I do grasp the concept of artistic license, but my issue here is that Reinert takes license when there is nothing to be gained. The most obnoxious single moment for me is the Apollo 13 'Houston, We've had a problem..."" audio, which has added sound effects not found in the original (common through the film) and edits bits of the Apollo 13 dialogue together with the Apollo 12 lightning strike problems during launch, which in his mind, I suppose added drama, but in my mind distorts the truth and fails to tell the story of either of the two emergencies well. When unnecessary compilation and editing like this continues through the film it makes for a very muddled, less factual, film that the materiel deserves.
Some reviewers have praised the film for conveying the 'feeling' of going to the moon well. I don't really dispute that, I just think that a documentary can be factually accurate and have information accurately presented (like in the Nova special) and still be captivating. In fact I think it would be more captivating.
The DVD does have some strong points, that are unique though. One that is useful is the ability to turn on subtitles of astronaut names and selected flight controller names (although mistakes are made here too, they are generally minor). My favorite feature of the DVD by far is a section in which Al Bean (Apollo 12) describes and explains many of his Apollo paintings, which is absolutely fascinating. This alone gave the review three stars.
Overall, there are many better choices of Apollo documentaries available, especially considering the outlandish cost of the DVD. Many critics liked this film. I guess all that means is that many critics prefer a stylized, or 'Hollywood,' form of documentary.",3.0
"Other reviews have touched upon what I found fatally distracting about this disc: the ""artistic liberties"" taken constitute inaccuracy. Much is shockingly out of order or just plain wrong. We see Ed White's  Gemini spacewalk presented as though it occured during an Apollo mission,  we see the wrong astronauts' names in captions (subtitled), we hear Apollo  12's liftoff distress call seamlessly integrated with Apollo 13's post-TLI  distress call...all apparently for no reason.
I was able to enjoy this  film for other merits. Al Bean's paintings and commentary were beautifully  done, and I had not seen much of the footage. I was particularly struck by  long sequences in which we third stage ignite and the Earth rush away, the  disappearing descent stage as the ascent stage takes off, and the LM  approaching the orbiting CM. Beautiful. But if you're looking for an  informative documentary,  this slipshod random splicing of clips is not for  you. Get Moon Shot or From the Earth to the Moon, instead.",3.0
"Terrance McNally's LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! was a Tony-winning powerhouse on the New York stage--but the same cannot be said of the play's screen adaptation, which plays like a yuppie version of BOYS IN THE BAND that has unexpectedly collided with ON GOLDEN POND... but without much benefit to either.

The story itself concerns a group of eight gay men who meet at an isolated but lavish country house for summer weekends and who thrash out their various hopes, desires, and relationships in the process.  In this sort of ensemble piece, where the story is more about people than plot, the cast is key--and in truth the cast is quite fine, with John Glover a particular standout in the dual role of John and James Jeckyll.

Trouble is, the gifts of the cast are repeatedly undercut by some of the most uninspired direction and cinematography going, and after a while it all begins to acquire a strangely superficial quality.  I laughed now and then, I felt moved now and then, and I was occasionally impressed with some of the dramatic ideas involved.  But when the final credits rolled I felt the film as a whole lacked any significant impact.  The cast, however, makes it worth the effort.

"Characters are different stereotypes: the gay musical queen, the ""perfect yuppie couple"", the tormented pianist, the terminal aids character, the collected aging dancer with the handsome to dye for blind and cheating lover, the hispanic wannabe dancer.
At the end this movie has no point to it, you never learn to appreciate profundly any character, you never can see any depths in each of the relationships, and just learn some gossip about their lives, and how they eventually die. Perhaps many can relate to the charactyers in basic levels, but there is not much love or at least not very well expressed, not much sympathy either, and some compassion for both characters played by John Glover (perhaps the only real ""actor"" in this film).
Conclusion: the film is shallow superficial and with only some bright moments provided by J.G and a small scene with JG and Jason Alexander; the rest are just ordinary ""characters/actors"" who dropped by this countryhouse/film.",3.0

"Nominated for two Academy Awards, including one for its screenplay, Wag The Dog turned out to be one of the more interesting films of the 1990s. When the President of the United States faces accusations that threaten to destroy his reelection chances, several of his advisors work with a Hollywood director to concoct a fake war in Albania to serve as a distraction. Released several months before the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, Wag The Dog foreshadowed events to come as some believe hostilities with Iraq were used to draw attention away from the impeachment proceedings. But regardless of what occurred in real life, Wag The Dog paints a hilarious and clever picture of the endless manipulations political handlers attempt to pull off in the real world. Hopefully, they're never on such a grand scale...

With the president (Michael Belson) embroiled in a breaking sex scandal, two of his top aides - Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) and Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) - immediately move into damage control mode. Election Day is too close to wait for the scandal to simply pass over and become old news, so Brean comes up with a plan.

Visiting noted Hollywood director Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman), Brean pitches an absurd proposal. He wants Motss to create a war for him. In one of the more memorable scenes from the film, Brean and Motss are watching a White House press conference, and at Motss' request, Brean calls the White House and tells the White House Press Secretary word-for-word what to say to the press. The detailed manipulation is only a sign of things to come. Making the decision to create tension between the United States and Albania, the two men conjure up more than just an international crisis.

Along with singer Johnny Dean (Willie Nelson), they create songs to commemorate the non-existent victims and war heroes. They even manufacture a fraudulent war hero, Sergeant William Schumann (Woody Harrelson) - whose sacrifice is acknowledged by throwing shoes into trees and onto power lines. But will Brean and Motss succeed in their deception? Can political aides really conspire to concoct lies big enough to change an election...

Dustin Hoffman received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his portrayal of Hollywood director Stanley Motss. Hoffman plays the part to perfection, combining bits of humor and eccentricity to create a memorable character. De Niro (who later stars with Hoffman in Meet The Fockers), despite being overshadowed by Hoffman's Oscar nomination, puts in a strong performance as well. It's not quite The Godfather II, but it's a lot better than Analyze This. In addition, Wag The Dog is one of the few films where I believe Anne Heche makes a mark for herself as a serious actress and not just the former companion of Ellen DeGeneres. Overall, the acting and direction for this movie are more than enough to make Stanley Motss proud...

Wag The Dog raises some arguable questions of the true freedom of the American citizenry. America may have freedom of the press, but how do we know what new is true and what news is not? Wag The Dog makes for great satire in respect to a free republic's own vulnerability to propaganda. If the Clinton impeachment proceedings had not been so close to the release of this film, it might well have dropped off the radar. But the Clinton scandal and all the questions surrounding it only served to make Wag The Dog a part of history and a part of the day's political vernacular, and that's why it's a definite must-see film...

"Wag The Dog is a brilliant political satire that is more relevant today than ever before. The film is based aroudn the precept of a president who is up for reelection and suddenly hit by (would ya believe it) a sex scandal in the oval office. In an effort to draw public attention away from the sex scandal it is decided to ""fake"" a war with Albania. Take into account this movie was made BEFORE the monica lewinsky drama - in fact it was released just a few weeks before the whole clinton sex scandal broke. Prophetic?

The movie actually had nothing to do with clinton. it was based on a book, which argued that the gulf war never really happened and was filmed and produced by hollywood producers hired by the first Bush administration to boost an otherwise failing presidency. However Wag The Dog doesnt focus on any specific president, but more on the concept of a precidency faking a war and manipulating public perception.

The issues brought up by Wag The Dog invite a welcome debate in america. It Criticizes the heavy use of spin doctors in political campagnes and how the president in our times is a ""product"" that we are ""sold"". It raises questions as to where the limits of this power to decieve the public could end and prompts one to contemplate the relationships between the public, the media, and the goverment. The fact is the media now-a-days cares more about ratings than truth and feels more like entertainment than information. The impact of sound bytes and headlines and those pictures and stories that capture the public mind  on our democracy cannot be underestimated.

The problem? The problem is that while Wag The Dog is a great topic of discussion for after you watch it, and is VERY politically relevant... it just isn't a very good movie. It's not very funny for a comedy, and is many times disengaging and unbelievable in thier specific story-line. Robert Dinero and the rest of the cast deliver good performances but to a fairly bland script. This movie definatley looks a lot better on paper than on screen.

The bottom line is that Wag The Dog makes an excellent movie to watch in a classroom to instigate a thoughtful debate about politics and the media. Wag The Dog is probably a movie every american should force themselves to sit through at least once and then really think about. And Wag The Dog is a movie that trancends hollywood to an extent that the term ""wag the dog"" is a commonly known term now in politics and in the media (IE 'you think the president is pulling a wag the dog?). It is and SHOULD REMAIN a heavily discussed film. However, all in all, the movie in and of itself offers little to the audience and is not likely to be enjoyed or remembered by many by anything EXCEPT it's underlying theme.",3.0
"The name of the film is ""wag the dog"" and it was made in 1997. The director of the film is Barry Levinson.

The main casts are Robert De Niro as Conrad Brean, Anna Hechs as Winifred Ames and Dustin Hoffman as Stanley Motss.

I think the film is a mix of a comedy and a political satire.

The plot is about a election in the USA. It comes out that the president has a affaire with a young student. So now his assistants Miss Ames, Mr Brean and the producer Stanley Motss try with crimal and faked movies to influence and convince the people to vote for the old president. It really shows how influenceable people and also the media are.

The movie is at all funny but sometimes also boring.

I think the movie is for people wo are interested in politics and like to see how much the media and people are influenceable and how succsesful the lies are.",3.0
"The movie ""Wag the dog"" is from 1997 and was filmed in the USA.The main charakter were Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Anne Heche. This political satire is about the president who is caught up in a sex scandal two weeks before the election. Mr. Brean, a political fixer and Winifred, the assistent of the president trys to distract the people and invent a war against Albania with the help of a Hollywood producer. So the people are diverted away from the scandal. Of course this action is not without any problems but they know to make it right.

This movie want to show that the people should not believe all the things which are shown in TV.

In my opinon the film is very good. At first the movie seems to be unreal, but during the film you will see that the things could happen.

Sometimes the film is very difficult to understand because in this film are many things which happen at the same time. But when you are very interested and concentrated on this film you will  understand it.

I would say that this movie is for people who are old enough to understand it. It is not a movie for children because it would be to hard to understand.",3.0
"The movie ""Wag the Dog"" is directed by Barry Levinson in 1997 and written by David Mamet and Hilary Henken. The main characters are Stanley Motss who ia a famous Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman), Conrad Brean a political fixer (Robert de Niro) and Anne Heche as a ninnish White House aide. The whole story plays in America. Its only two weeks to the next presidential election. Motss, Brean and the ninnish White House aide use a hoax war in Albania to distract the people from a presidential sex scandal. To do this persuasively they make some kind of spots where they show this war... They invent songs, storys with hard destinies and other crazy things. You have to watch this movie to understand the content and laugh about it.

In my opinion its a well made movie... you have the possibility to see politic in a satirical way and not to think about all this stuff worried. In a way this movie predicted the real life. The affair of Bill Clinton and the Iraq war. This nmovie is a satirical comedy and made very well. I recommend this to everybody who likes to laugh about serious things, too, and who is not always worried about everything. I find the dialog sometimes very hard to understand and the plot is often a bit exaggerated but its funny and for everybody. But the actors are well chosen and made all more interesting.",3.0
"The film ""Wag the dog"" was written by Mamet and Hilary Henken and produced by Barry Levinson in 1997. This political satire is about the president who is caught up in a sex scandal two weeks before the election and his spin doctor (Robert DeNiro) and his white house aide (Anne Heche) are brought in to fix up things.

They invent a story start some rumors and studio footage is inserted into the news to create the illusion of a war, so the attention of the public is diverted away from the scandal. Of course things go wrong but time after time they know to make it work.

In my opinion the movie is partly a bit hard to understand, because some scenes are coded and you do not know what is mean. I think ""Wag the dog"" was made really good, because it corresponds our real political stories. Take the example with Bill Clinton, he have had an affair with Monica Levinski, it was a big scandal. This movie was shown on TV before the scandal with Clinton took place, it seems like a prediction...We have the possibility to have a view in political live and we can realize that some things shown on TV correspond real life. A well done movie, with a good producer and real good actors, because I think for example DeNiro fit really good in this role. A gorgeous movie! I recommend this movie to all people who are interested in politic and who like to know how the world really goes on!!!",3.0
"Wheras politics is not always my cup of tea, Wag The Dog certainly has some amusing moments.  When the president gets caught in engaging in an ainappropriate affair, leave it to Dustin Hoffman an Robert De Nero to come to the rescue.  These guys create a make beleive war an coach the press secretary into diverting the public's attention.

onto the small screen.

When the initial story runs out of steam, another idea about glorifying a supposed war hero caught behind enemy lines makes its way on to the small screen.  At this point the president's sexual escapades certainly is somewhat ignored.

Wag The Dog certainly makes you think how scanals within government can be covered up quite effectively.",3.0
"As a satire, this movie does very well.  Especially if you don't like Clinton or politicians in general.  However, I never found myself completely hooked in to the whole idea just because it seemed so absurd.  In fact, the movie bored me at times.  The acting was slightly above average, but nothing spectacular.  It makes a good movie if you are in the mood for political satire or just enjoy the political genre in general.",3.0
"Wag the Dog: rated R, 1 hour and 40 minutes
 A group of spin-doctors plan to create a diversion to turn the Americans' attention away from a scandal aimed at the president just weeks before the election. Robert De Niro plays Conrad Brean, the intelligence of this group of con artists, who produces the illusion, along with the help of an assistant (Anne Heche), and a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman). Brean thinks of the ideas and Motss (Hoffman) puts them into action. Together they succeed in fooling America and rigging the elections.  This movie has no doubt a very clever plot, with many smart, comical points, but it also lacks the image that makes a movie what it is. The characters are exceedingly shallow, and in general, it seems that all the trouble gone through to fake a war can be made easier if instead the efforts were put into helping the president make a new campaign slogan, which is repeatedly made fun of throughout the film. Overall, the ideas are acceptable, yet the execution appears to have failed.  Though the movie seems full of humor and canny remarks, the actual message expressed in Wag The Dog is rather disturbing. This poses the question: If America can be deceived so easily at something as difficult to conduct as a war, how would America react to a small scam made up? The film proves how easily the news can be manipulated and controlled. In this movie there is no distinguishing borderline between fact and fiction. The idea that anything seen or heard on the news might be a hoax, the comical punch line of this movie, may not be so funny after all.
Wag the Dog, directed by Barry Levinson, also starring Woody Harrelson, is a `political satire', which becomes less than satisfying, B-.",3.0
"While I canot say that ""Wag The Dog"" was ""enjoyable"" -- much of the dialogue was contrived (as intended since WTD is a bleak comedy), and although the acting is competent, scenes like the crash fell flat as story devices -- I found it worth watching because it seems so disturbingly indicative of contemporary conditions.  (I haven't shown it to our kids because the language is offensive.)  This is not the place to explain the politics of life to Clinton's defenders, but the spin-doctoring by the administration (aided by media shills riding shotgun) to divert the public's attention from the festering corruption (exemplified by frying people with cruise missiles from Sudan to Afghanistan to Serbia -- remember operation ""Desert Firefly/Fox""?) serves as a warning that tyranny usually creeps up on a docile public by stealth, deceit and bribery.  Willy Nelson's patriotic war-song sent shivers up my spine because it reminded me how gullible the electorate can be in blindly rallying around demagogues merely because enough voters were bamboozled.  WTD is insightfully  portrayed satire, because unlike most of the tendentious propaganda (e.g., ""The American President"") rolling out of  Hollywood, it actually illuminates the dark side's manipulation of ""information"" as performed by the left.  (No, there are no such organs on the ""right"".)  WTD is a satirical commentary on our contemporary state of superficial celebrity-driven politics.  Those who find such a condition acceptable will probably find the film objectionable.  Members of the vast right-wing conspiracy however, will be both amused and bothered.",3.0
"Imagine, if you can, a memorial service for someone you really loved: a parent, a sibling, a spouse, or a teacher. Imagine that during the service a loud recording of vigorous, loud  piano music drowned out whatever was being said by the person speaking. The narration of the first of these two FLW documentariesas it is delivered by sensitive, knowledgeable speakers, including Wrights blood relativesis overwhelmed by vigorous, loud, highly rhythmic piano music. Burns and Novik obviously believed that straightforward narration was could not convey the emotions appropriate for such a documentary film, and that the sound track needed to be jazzed up. The result has all the charm of what were forced to hear through the loudspeakers in Wal-Mart or the local fitness gym. Music is shoveled into the program like crushed rock or manure, and its distracting as hell. Wrights unquestioned genius doesnt require this to be appreciated. And, in fact, it detracts from his genius. If subtitles had been provided, I could have happily turned off the sound tract and read the narration. But they are not.

This problem completely vanishes in the second of the two documentaries. And oh, what a glorious difference that makes! I have a sense that someone told the filmmakers to balance the music and the narration the second time around, and the filmmakers heeded the advice.",3.0
"This is a movie intended for general audience. Very good. A man ahead of his time, known world widely for his masterworks. Shows his struggles in life and some of his important works. As some people noticed, indeed, it's a bit unbalanced, his works get some attention, but his life and tragedies get most of the time. Yet time is short and the moviemakers dicided that, nice to known about his personal life, but his work could be more spotlighted.",3.0
"This is an excellent documentary, as Ken Burns is a top class film maker, but it is let down by trying to squeeze the film onto one dvd disc.
The program is in two parts, each which goes for over an hour.
Each should be on its own disc which would have reduced the rate of compression and raised the picture quality.
This lack of picture quality affects the well photographed film of the justifiably famous Wright buildings and houses we are shown, and that is a pity.
Hopefully this documentary will be available on blu-ray at some time in the future and then we will be able to see these great buildings in a quality that they deserve.",3.0
"At the beginning of the movie Ginger Rogers witnesses someone dropping a baby off on the steps of an orphanage on a winter day.  She thinks that the baby needs to be inside out of the cold so she steps in and does the good  deed of taking it inside to complete the delivery.  When the orphanage  won't accept her story about being a passerby she finds herself literally  left holding the bag, with the baby in it.  The rest of the story is full  of the misadventures that come with trying to juggle a single woman's urban  life with demands of caring for a baby.  Come to think of it, it took three  men (Danson, Selleck, and Guttenberg) in ""Three Men and a Baby""  to equal Ginger Rogers in this movie.  Both of the movies work.
I'd  recommend this movie, but it's certainly not a classic in my mind.",3.0

"Jackie Chan's First Strike, also known as Police Story 4: First Strike, is probably the weakest of the series thus far. The movie opens with an entertaining James Bond-ish scene in the snow to get you going, but takes it's time before it heats up again. The whole theme of the Police Story movies have changed dramatically.

The first two were true Hong Kong action police detective movies, but starting with Supercop, Chan seemed to change the direction of the films, heading more towards a Bond-like movie. In fact the final underwater fight scene in First Strike is definitely an homage to Thunderball, a Sean Connery James Bond movie. Besides that there is really only one more notable action scene in the film, which would be the scene where Jackie visits Annie to tell her he is innocent.

Here Chan exhibits that clearly, he is a master of his environment. Jackie uses almost every single prop in each setting to thwart and disarm his attackers. These incredible acrobatic feats are something that over the years has become a staple in Jackie Chan's martial arts style and is something that keeps people coming back to see his movies.",3.0
"Jackie Chan's First Strike(1997) is the fourth installment in the Police Story film series. It was released in Hong Kong in 1996. New Line Cinema released the film in North America in early 1997. The film emulates a lot of material from James Bond movies. There's a skiing scene that's an homage to A View to a Kill(1985). First Strike is a fair amount of fun and it's better than some of the movies Chan made after the year 2000. Maggie Cheung is not in the film, but there is a cute Chinese girl who is a fraction of Chan's age! In the film, the thin plot features Chan Ka Kui(Jackie Chan) trying to stop the Russian Mafia from getting their hands on a themonuclear warhead. Parts of the film were filmed in Australia and are already in English. There's mechanical sharks that can back up and only one real kung fu fight in the film. The Hong Kong version had a subtle, lifeless music score. New Line hired J. Peter Robinson to compose an energetic music score for the film. Some of the Australian scenes use a dijeridoo sound. Even in the 1990's, Jackie Chan was getting older. Instead of a climactic kung fu fight, the last half features Chan driving a car into the air and smashing it into the bad guy's sail boat. Jackie Chan's First Strike(1997) is worth buying if you see it in a shopping center bargain bin.",3.0

"I found the acting to be a little inconsistent throughout the film, as though all of the actors were not 100% sure of who their characters were supposed to be, where they were from (accent-wise), and what their motivations were. I also found the movie to be about 30 minutes too long. In addition, the child abuse aspect was very disturbing and unnecessary. That said, it was nicely atmospheric and intriguing to wonder about how this story rumbled inside of Mr. King's mind in addition to all of his other stories. The man is frightfully full of characters and ideas. Were it up to me though, I would have made one more pass at the script and edited out about 30 minutes or so.",3.0
It was ok.  Made you think; nothing spectacular.,3.0
"There was something to upset everyone in this film, but it was a more intelligent treatment of religion than, for example Bill Mahars ""Religulous"" or the comedy farce ""Dogma.""  Of course, that's not saying much.

I have no pity for those one-star raters who did not bother to note the R rating or read it PLAINLY at the beginning of the film.  Outraged claimers that it was not a ""family film"" or ""for children"" should hang their heads in shame at their own stupidity. Go ahead and run the DVD through a meat-grinder or whatever floats your boat.

It is easy to take cheap shots at religion in any movie, it is another thing to showcase the problem of extreme people who search for meaning and the dark places they find along the way.  This film attempts that, and it is up to you and your beliefs to decide whether it succeeds or fails.

The main character is in a true mindless dead-end job with no explanation how she got into the world of call-centers. Her attitudes towards ""hooking up"" (very casual sex) is self-destructive. I'm not sure why they felt her actions needed to be on display so graphically and within minutes of the film starting. I guess subtlety was not the goal.

When she gets inspired to find out more about her relationship with God, she does not seek out more of the mainstream belief systems, asking questions of a Rabbi, Priest or Pastor.  Instead she finds herself in the company of what I would consider fringe groups with their own child-prophet.

Is she going mad or is she a God-drunken fool that may someday do saintly things?  I won't say any more.

A fine cast of actors with some dialog that was good, but other parts sounding like they were lifted from the script of some low-budget ""end of days"" film done by a religious group with no movie making experience.

Perhaps best enjoyed by those studying religion or more likely comparative religion.  For a lot of people, it will just be an annoyance. This is not a put-down of those people, but this film may end up just being a confused mess that too many people took too seriously, like the early 70's film ""The Magus.""  Even the author of that book admitted it was a mess and rewrote it years later.",3.0
"Some dark subject matter, which didn't bother me, but I didn't like any of the characters. I almost turned the movie off.

I don't remember having that problem with the book.

In the movie, the characters don't like each other and they show it, which made me not like them.

Dolores Claiborne's daughter acts like a bratty teenager, even after she's grown up.

Even Dolores was unlikeable most of the time, despite the casting of Kathy Bates.",3.0
While I did enjoy the subject matter of this movie I was disappointed that it did not stay with the exact  biblical scriptures regarding the coming event of the Rapture.

Non believers will be taken somewhat astray.,3.0

"I'm not really sure what attracted me to this film, but once I started watching it I couldn't stop.  Perhaps it was the dreariness of the setting, or the obnoxiousness of the dialog, but I guess the main reason I watched was to see if a plot ever realy developed.  I kept hoping that something of significance would eventually happen, but it really never did.

The characters are quirky and shallow.  You don't know much more about them than when the film began.  The older mother kept asking her adult daughter if she would be moving to Australia.  To me it was a simple yes/no question, but the daughter couldn't come out and give a yes or a no.  The two elderly women heading to a out of town funeral don't do much to carry the stroy, either.  The young man and woman have their moments, but they, too don't add much to the story.  The two young boys who skipped school have the most involved conversation, though it becomes tedious in its own right.

In the end, nothing really jumped out at me and said this was something that warranted the time I spent watching it.  If you like boring quirky movies then this should appeal to you.  If you want to see characters develop and move through some type of conflict to a resolution, then look somewhere else.",3.0

"Lets say you wanted to make a movie discussing the challenges of being a gay couple trying to live their lives in peace and with charity to all.  You want your movie to change minds, to overcome hate, bias, and misunderstanding. How would you start out the movie?  Why not start out your movie with the two men noisily french-kissing and groping each other at a playground with a lot of extreme close-ups and crotch grabbing.  Let this dry hump sequence run for twenty minutes or so and then let the movie grow from there right? Here you have the biggest problem with The Rapture.  Hey, lets try to so offend our target audience that they will smash the DVD before we even try to speak our message.  To say that the early nudity and sex scenes are gratuitous is an understatement.  You can communicate sexual decadence without swinging boobs and sundry body parts filling the camera lens.  There are great themes here that I will never be able to discuss with my adult sunday school class.  Themes about how a beautiful thing like religious conversion can become toxic with no or poor spiritual guidance.  About how faith guided only by emotional experiences without seeking wisdom or reflection can even become murderous.  About putting God to the test and being so confident of His will that we shun Him for not meeting our confused and inadequate expectations.  A good movie that epic fails.",3.0

"I caught this film recently on the SyFy Channel.  I thought it gave a fair representation of a particular ""Christian"" eschatology, namely the 19th & 20th century phenomena of the ""born again believer"" and their obsession, over everything else Christian, on ""The Rapture.""  Mimi Rogers, as Sharon, gives a fine performance as an obsessed pleasure feeling sex addict who comes to see the emptiness of her life.  Sharon works at a dead end job as an 411 operator.  While cruising with her friend Vic, played by Patrick Bauchau, ever on the prowl for swingers at airport lounges, she meets a couple, the woman who has a strange tattoo on her back, of The Pearl.  Obviously a reference to the parable of Jesus and the story of the ""Pearl of Great Price.""  One day while eavesdropping on her Christian co-workers she hears them speaking of ""The Pearl.""  She is visited by two fundamentalists who leave her a copy of the New Testament.  She converts a former sex partner, Randy, played by David Duchovny.  There is also a prophet, a young boy, who I think is her bosses' son who predicts the near end of the world.  Well things go swimmingly for Sharon and Randy.  They have a daughter and all is good in the world.  But, for how long?  Not very long.  Randy, is murdered by a disgruntled former employee at his place of business.  Sharon gets a vision to go to the desert with the daughter to await the Rapture.  Well, they are befriended by a local sheriff, but are on the verge of starvation.  Sharon kills her daughter to send her to heaven faster, and obvious reference to Abraham and Issac or Dylan's Highway 61.  Anyway, I will not ruin the ending.  I liked the movie, because despite its faults it gives a fair portrayal of belief built on feeling, which is what drove Sharon all along, whether sinner or saint.  And this analogy can be used for religion, politics, really anything in life.  For an independent film, not too bad.  Why it was shown on the SyFy Channel is beyond me, it more properly belongs on the Trinity Network, though I doubt the pretty descriptive sex scenes in the beginning of the film would pass muster.",3.0
"I was really surprised at the level of involvement I had with this film. On the surface, a movie about a bored hedonist who has a religious conversion and goes into the desert to await the coming of the Lord doesn't sound like something that would appeal. Yet the performances - particularly Mimi Rogers (as Sharon) - make it worthwhile.

It is slow-paced but not overly so. (I watched it with my daughter who was bored to tears- but hey it isn't an action movie.)

A film about religion (well faith) is something that doesn't exactly make it to the Multi-plexes very often but the subject matter it raises is worth exploring.

In the end I was extremely moved by Sharon's plight and the denoument, when it came, was devastating even though I had been expecting it.",3.0
"It is ok, but don't expect it to follow the book closely.  It is based on the book, but many events are in a different order, characters are added, omitted, etc.  I really wasn't a fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh's character and performance.  Overall, I preferred the book's version of characters and events more then the movie.  However, I did enjoy watching Kathy Bates performance :)",3.0
"DOLORES CLAIBORNE is a thrilling piece, beautifully photographed with at least two genuine shocks in it.  Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance, ably supported by a young Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Like all King adaptations, it's compulsively watchable, even though the basic subject-matter is familiar. Definitely worth a look, even though by the end of this piece, audiences feel as if they have been through the emotional mangle, just like Dolores herself.",3.0
"""Dolores Claiborne"" was the 1995 film version of the Stephen King novel of the same name that was considerable effort from director Taylor Hackford.  The performance by Kathy Bates was solid.  Jennifer Jason Leigh provided a very embittered character that we in final glimpses came to understand somewhat, which I think was too fleeting and Miss Jason Leigh should have been allowed to show more warmth as she seemed in the strange telling of the story somewhat overly dramatic.  Christopher Plummer has been better, certainly not giving a career defining performance as Bates very well could have.  I think Bates's performance could have been equal to her ""Misery"" character in another Stephen King movie.  Tony Gilroy's screenplay could have corrected these inaccuracies in achievement, but then his screenplay apparently may be based on an official Stephen King work, but fails to rise to the level of Hitchcock.  Hitchcock never lived down his mistake, that Gilroy bases his whole structure of the tale around, that could never be forgiven him in his 50 film career beyond ""Stage Fright"" in 1950 when he told a lie in a flashback.  This film cheats on this flaw to a major degree and thereby takes down an otherwise good film.  It is not a problem with Stephen King as the filmmakers could very well have told this tale without this ineptitude despite if one likes King or not.  Then, I do not consider myself too pleased with the public that took to King's popularity.",3.0
"As a born again Christian, the one thing I have learned from God is to be understanding of others.  The opinions of the reviewers is just that opinions, as is mine. Mimi Roger, portraying  a person struggling with the meaning of life, was very good.  She being A SCIENTOLOGIST, would have a hidden agenda for acting in this movie. Religion is man made, God is real and the love He has for us is simply that.  He gave man a conscience so that man could have the ability to make a choice between right and wrong. In this movie, I felt Mimi Rogers condenscension of belief in God from the very beginning.  Yes, the sandal wearing, peace loving attitude she portrayed, is what a true believer feels upon salvation.  That is because when Christ truly enters your heart, and might I add it is because you ask Him to, you see the world through His eyes, that of love.  As you grow in your Christian faith, He delivers you from all the angst you carry around.  For some it is immediate, for me it is through stages of growth and having a loving partnership with Him.  Whether you believe or not, to me it makes sense to have this attitude towards the world than the one in which you live in cynicism, ignorance, and apathetic conclusions.  If this film did nothing else it makes you want to figure out what is the answer.  The character of Sharon wanted to believe there was something out there better than what she had.  Well...look where her ""belief"" took her, into a clean living life with understanding and compassion for the world.  She led others to a true saving knowledge of Jesus Christ especially the man she marries and has a beautiful child with. (HOW TERRIBLE THAT WAS) No where in the Bible does it state that becoming a christian guarantees a life without problems.  Matter of fact it brings problems to your life  because of the other entity called Satan.  Yes, he is just as real and he controls the earthly realms of life.  Nothing makes him angrier that someone giving up their life of sin to serve and believe in Jesus Christ.  If the producer of this film had tried to bring this truth into the film rather than placing the blame totally on God, then viewers would have had a more legitimate claim to an opinion.  As it were the character of Sharon did what a lot of people do who do not ground their faith in scripture, they look for the first thing they can to cast blame on anything other than looking at the flaws within themselves.  The non believers who watched this film were vindicated in their opinions because they speak of which they do not know.  The portrayal of the brain washing tatics of the character towards her daughter was true to an extent with some christians.  But with those of us who read the bible and believe it as God's word, it was ludicrous.  God would never tell you to kill your child, he hates murder.  God would never tell you when He was coming, because he expects you to be ready whether you are eating, sleeping, or playing monopoly.  He will not choose any special one above the other to reveal this too.  He loves us all the same.  As a christian I was not offended by this movie but at the blatant one sided opinion of God it portrayed.  The character made her choices from the beginning.  She CHOSE to live a sinful life, she chose to try something different, she chose to improve her life, she chose to end her daughters life, she chose to turn away from the truth. SHE RECEIVED HELL BECAUSE SHE CHOSE IT.  Her daughter asks her do you see heaven, she says yes and chose to live in darkness because of an all too human trait, PRIDE.  Pride is what Satan gives you in order to justify your feeling of being more intelligent than God. If you are standing as she was at a portal of living clean and free or dirty and trapped, why in the world would you choose the latter.  Because Satan convinces you through pride and arrogance that you are smarter and better than such a simplistic choice of God.  It all boiled down to faith, it always will.  Either you have the faith to believe or you have the faith you are right to not believe.  What a gracious God we have to give us that choice because even when you choose to not believe, he still loves you.  As with any good parent, we love our children unconditionally even when they do something wrong.  If that is the decision made we have to let them deal with the consequences, bad or good.  That is what God does.

So laugh if you will at us Christians, choose to have an opinion on a subject you are not versed to speak or dare to stand up for yourself and find out what is real about God.  A movie is just a story out of someones mind, an entertainment, take what that persons vision makes you feel and follow through with your own conclusions.  After all you have nothing to lose but your soul.  Just look at Sharon in the end.  Scary.",3.0
"Controversial and somewhat disjointed, this is a look at one woman's journey through emptiness and promiscuity to being born again to becoming religiously delusional and finally to rejecting her faith.  It would have worked better had the writer/director pulled it together more cohesively; as it is, there are a lot of blanks that are never filled in.",3.0

"Sharon (Mimi Rogers) is a lonely, suicidal young woman trying to find happiness in a hedonistic lifestyle of group sex and alcohol. Things begin to change when she begins having re-occuring dreams of a beautiful pearl which somehow brings her brief moments of peace and tranquility. And so begins Sharon surreal spiritual odyssey in search of the ""Will of God"" eventually leading to her embracing the Christian faith. Her new set of beliefs seem to work quite well for awhile. She falls in love with Randy (David Duchovny), marries and is blessed with a little girl. Life is good.

However as we all know ""God's ways are not our own."" When things begin to go horribly wrong (Randy is murdered) Sharon's most basic assumptions concerning God's love and gift of salvation are challenged as she ponders the question, 'If God loves me why doesn't he answer my prayers?' When Sharon finally gets her wish and 'The Rapture' occurs she must decide once and for all where she wants to spend eternity. Here the film has its finest moment and makes its deepest impact.

This has to be one of the most confusing, convoluted, unrealistic views of evangelical Christian fundamentalism ever presented on film. If it wasn't for the subject matter which has always both frightened and fascinated me, I wouldn't have been able to finish watching. Obviously director Michael Tolkin had an axe to grind and I wouldn't consider recommending this film if it wasn't for the ending. The final scene is so devastating and nihilistic that it leaves the viewer in stunned silence. Definitely a film for a very select audience, stay away if you are easily offended. However if you are in the mood for something different and totally unexpected this may be the movie for you.",3.0

This serves the purpose of editing out some details that were once prominent in the 4:3 version of the film.

"I did think that this movie was interesting and had a point of view that was worth discussion, but this is not a Christian movie. This movie may be called The Rapture and it is about the end of times when some are called home to God, but this is also a deservedly R-rated movie for sex and some violence.
The main focus of the movie is the conflict of a woman who suffers from a lack of spiritual focus. She does discover God but even in the discovery of God there is conflict. The point of view of the movie is not a Christian one. It is worth examining, but because this movie was placed under the general heading of Christian video and because its title is The Rapture, people can be misled.",3.0
"These two great actresses provide a tour de force that is well worth watching!

Add that to a good Stephen King story, an ingenious screenplay adaptation and loving direction by Taylor Hackford and this is a suspense drama you will enjoy owning.

Unfortunately, the only Special Feature of note is an enthusiastic audio commentary by dircetor Hackford which ultimately turns into a 20 minute thank-you speech to acknowledge the unseen heroes of filmmaking.  Just goes to show you how under-appreciated the majority of filmmaking folks are, even by Hollywood standards and within the Hollywood community.  So, if that's the case, why not show some ""Behind the Scenes"" or ""Making Of"" featurettes that give us these talented folks their real due!?!

How hard could it have been to get Stephen King and/or Jennifer Jason Leigh to participate in an interview/commentary on the film?  JJL, incidentally, gives a committed performance you will either love or loathe and sports one of the strangest, most unflattering hairdos in recent movie history (is it a wig!?).

"It would seem that the great Alfred Hitchcock felt obligated to make a screwball comedy, since it was all the rage in the thirties and forties. Despite the best efforts of a talented cast, however, this is a pretty charmless affair.
Oddly enough, Hitchcock's Suspicion, which was released the same year, also concerns a marriage lacking in trust, but it's considerably more successful. Maybe that's because it's easier to sympathize with and care about Joan Fontaine's character in that movie (and in his classic, Rebecca).
In Suspicion, Fontaine tries desperately to trust Cary Grant--who may or may not have married her for her money--whereas both of the the characters in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, played by Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery, lack trust in the other. That made them both unsympathetic to me, whereas the guileless Gene Raymond seemed all the more appealing in comparison, but he's presented as more of a rube (a bit like Ralph Bellamy, who always lost the girl to Grant) than as a serious contender for a sophisticated lady's affections.
If you're a Hitchcock fanatic, as I am, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a must simply because it reveals a different side of the man, but if what you're really looking for is a first-rate screwball comedy, look no further than Howard Hawks' Twentieth Century, also with Lombard, or His Girl Friday, with Grant and Rosalind Russell.",3.0
"IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THIS IS AN ALFRED HITCHCOCK MOVIE!!!  I just didn't think the script was that great.  The charming leads are great separately, but imo have no real chemistry together. I could barely get through this movie because it was so boring.  I would only give it two stars, but I just can't bring myself to give an Alfred Hitchcock movie such a low rating.

"I had seen this movie ages ago and liked it very much.  On this latest viewing,  however, I found the plot to be a bit too daffy for my more mature taste.  In fact, having studied psychology, I discovered that Carole Lombard's character has a serious personality disorder, which made  her behavior uncomfortable to watch, and really very unfunny.",3.0
"In Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Hitchcock gives us his normal assortment of flawed characters; David Smith (Robert Montgomery) is a narcissistic bully whose neurotic ex-wife, Ann (Carole Lombard) ends up engaged to his effeminate, mama's boy law partner, Jefferson Custer (Gene Raymond). In a normal Hitchcock film these personalities would have been allowed to develop much more darkly instead of having an insipid, comedic plot forced upon them.  Consider that the Smith character confides in his wife early on that given a choice he would not marry her again, is overjoyed to learn that their marriage license is invalid, stalks her relentlessly when she begins dating again, gets her fired from her job, and finally ends up dragging her across the floor in a headlock in a fit of rage. Hysterical! But hey, who needs restraining orders; she just loves that big galoot.

As for the relationship between Ann and Custer, Hitchcock gives us something interesting to chew on mid-way through the film. After an excellent scene at the New York World's Fair in which the two are stranded on a parachute ride in a driving rain, they end up at Custer's apartment where Ann appears to goad him into making a pass at her, ""Most men would have made at least some kind of pass by now, however faint..."", even getting him drunk in the process.  The scene quite clearly suggests that Ann is yearning for something more physical, yet likely considers Custer homosexual. At one point she comments on his amazing interior decorating skills, ""Now I know why you're still single"", and she fails even at one last attempt to get a real kiss from him on her way out the door. By the time she gets around to admonishing him at the end of the film, ""What kind of a man are you??"", one just wants to say, 'well, you knew that an hour ago'.

At this point, I paused the film, wondering where in the world Hitchcock was taking this.  And yet, in the very next scene the two are meeting his parents in his office to announce they are dating!  The scene proceeds from tragedy to farce when the Smith character awkwardly barges in and presents himself as hopelessly deranged.  The rest of the film is downhill from there, with contrived coincidences and an utterly predictable ending.

It's a comedy that should have been a film noir - obsession, black mail, feuding law partners in a desperate love triangle with a classic Hitchcock blonde.  What a movie it could have been.",3.0
"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...

I'm a big Hitchcock fan.  Nearly all of his movies are great.  In my opinion, he's the greatest director of all time.  Second place would have to go to Spielberg.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) is a so-called ""screwball comedy"" that stars Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery.  I would instead classify it as a ""romantic comedy"".  To me, this movie is rather flat.  The humor fell a little flat with me.  There were some funny moments, but they didn't have me laughing out loud.  The movie seems inconsistent throughout and somewhat predictable.  This comedy movie was an experiment by Hitchcock.  He only did one other comedy - The Trouble With Harry (1955), and that was a ""black comedy"".  I think Hitchcock was a funny guy generally speaking, but I think his humor works a lot better when it is used sparingly in his movies.  Every Hitchcock movie has a couple of light moments sprinkled in.  It's designed to let the audience breathe a little.  Even some of Hitchcock's cameo appearances are humorous, for example his appearances in North By Northwest (1959), To Catch A Thief (1955), and Stage Fright (1950).  Some of his trailers are humorous as well, the best example being Frenzy (1972).  But I think doing straight up comedies wasn't Hitchcock's thing, for the most part.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith doesn't feel like a typical Hitchcock movie.  The trademark suspense is largely absent.  The trademark Hitchcock darkness is absent as well.

For me, the biggest reason to watch this movie is Carole Lombard.

Overall, this is a so-so Hitchcock movie that I can't give a full recommendation for.  You might like it more than I do.",3.0

"In a candid moment, Mr. Smith tells his wife that, had he to do it over again, he would not marry her. He says that this doesn't mean that he would like to marry someone else: He simply would enjoy the life of the bachelor again.

By a freak of the law, it turns out that their 3-year marriage is legally invalid. To him, this is simply a matter of the formality of a new marriage. To her, however, this is a chance to dump him and find someone new. Or so it seems...

Mr. Smith is told by another man that it is ""really bad"" when the man is forced out of his house for two nights instead of just one. Mrs. Smith reverts to her maiden name, and starts dating other men. He follows her around, trying to persuade her that he loves her and would want to marry her anew. He says that his very pursuit of her proves that he loves her and wants her. But she remains aloof and resistant. Some viewers may see in Mrs. Smith a portrayal of women as fickle, impossible to please, unable to make up their minds, and even flippant and childish.

And so it goes. Will Mr. and Mrs. Smith ever get back together again?

This flick has obvious old-fashioned themes: huge cars, smoking in public and on film, women discouraged from working outside the home if they are unmarried, etc.",3.0
"This review is for the 2004 Warner Brothers DVD.

This was Hitchcock's first and last attempt of directing a comedy.  'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is a comical farce about a married couple named Anne (Carole Lombard) and David Smith (Robert Montgomery) who clearly have some relationship issues since Anne has an established pattern of spending days at a time in bed anytime she has a disagreement with her husband.  After making up from their latest tiff, Anne asks David, ""If given the chance to go back in time would you marry me again""?  His instant response is ""No"", but then realizes he's made a terrible gaff and unsuccessfully tries to cover his tracks, but at least does enough damage control to keep them together.  Shortly after David learns that through a legal snafu, their marriage is void.  When Anne learns about this legal wrinkle, she separates and this sets up a cat and mouse game between the two seeing if they can salvage their relationship.

As much as I like Hitchcock and Carole Lombard, both Hollywood legends in their own right, I can't say this movie worked magic for me.  I do know that films like this were very popular in their day, but I didn't find any of it laugh-out-loud funny, although some of scenes put a smile on my face.  I did like the slice of life look of the film as it showed many interesting backdrops including several original interior shots plus scenes at an amusement park and a ski resort.  If you like screwball comedies from this era, you will probably be very entertained with the film.  If you don't like that type of humor, or hope to find lots of Hitchcock's creative artistry and cinematic brilliance, you will probably be disappointed with the film.

The B&W picture quality of this DVD is sharp and crisp but tiny specs of film deterioration showed up sporadically throughout the movie. The sound was very satisfactory for a film this old. The only bonus on the DVD is a short commentary about the film.

"At this writing, the new big screen theatrical release of the same name has generated spiked interest in Hitchcock's only overt comedy, MR. AND MRS. SMITH (Warner).

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's marital dilemma has some parallels in the slightly twisted premise of a bickering couple who discover they are not legally married.  And this after she asks him: ""Honey, if you had it to do all over again, would you marry me?""  And he says smugly: ""No.""

Oops, wrong answer!

They can't live with each other and then discover they can't live without eachother since they have one big thing in common: they both love arguing and fighting.

If you look carefully, there are sly Hitchcock touches throughout the film. I especially liked the scene where Carole Lombard shaves Robert Montgomery with an old fashioned straight edge blade. Although it was a scene about trust, for me it foreshadowed ""Psycho.""

In an interview Hitchcock suggested he didn't really understand the script, he just aimed his camera and filmed the actors saying the lines.  That is pure Hitchcock at his subversive best.

"MARTIN LAWRENCE wrote, directed and starred in this movie. Acting with him are BOBBY BROWN, DELLA REESE and LYNN WHITFIELD. So, this is supposed to be a comedy/drama. The acting was good. Bobby Brown was believable and Lynn Whitfield was very good. Della Reese was Della Resse.
I got this movie after I saw Martin Lawrence in BLUE STREAK, which I thought was really, really funny and LAWRENCE was really good. I was hoping this would be equal fun. IT WASN'T.

"I saw this movie when it originally came out and thought it was a good movie. Unlike many I feel Martin Lawrence is best doing standup, as an example in his TV show Martin he was notable for slapstick and urban shtick, but the efforts of Tisha Campbell, and the rest of the cast made the show a classic.  My opinion is the same for this movie, Martin puts in a cliched, effort that shows he was more full of himself than his character or his acting talent suggests. Luckily he surrounded himself with a strong supporting cast including a sober Bobby Brown, who may have had some acting chops back then! If you consider the wonderful mix of the iconic Della Reese whose has entertained us since the 50's and 60's, Lynn whitfield who is no doubt one of our most unheralded stars since the 70's (Josephine Baker story) and Regina king who has shown her talent and range from TV and now to movies and no doubt will be entertaining us for a long time and of course Roger Mosely who is always solid this could be considered an all star cast. THE STORY LINE is ok, I would love to have seen someone else play a smooth debonair young entrepenuer ladies man who wins over an obviously older, more refined, (and deranged) wealthy woman. The pacing and interplay between characters was good and enjoyable until Lynn Whitfield's character basically took over the last 3rd of the movie! Her portrayal early was right on as sexy, above it all with a hint of something odd about her. As the movie progressed and it became clear Martin's character was way over his head as Ms Whitfield basically took over with a riveting portrayal as the sicko dangerous jilted woman, who exuded sexy throughout, hell in my opinion she was more malevolent then Glen Close. I agree this movie really isn't that funny (are any of Martin's movies funny?) but it is an enjoyable suspense movie thanks to Lynn whitfield performance and support from the rest of the cast.

Pullman also directed and he made some interesting visual choices, particularly to keep the camera mobile during long master shots, which lends the movie an air of slight surprise. A creditable version of the book, which preserves the major plot points, while avoiding some of the novelists questionable politics. It's a pity that the disc is in the old square TV format, because it's clear that it was filmed with the 1.78, widescreen ratio in mind, and a wide transfer would have been a better choice, especially given those Western (Alberta) landscapes.",3.0

"Only Fuller's films run the gamut from low brow Ed Wood-like total crap to great moments and writing that rival the best moments in a Stanley Kubrick or Martin Scorsese film. Yet, he never had total control over any of his material. Even his magnum opus, the terrific war film The Big Red One, was butchered by its studio, and not restored until nearly a quarter century later. Similarly, The Naked Kiss was butchered to a point where Fuller threatened to have his name removed from it. In some ways, this film superficially resembles Federico Fellini's Nights Of Cabiria, save that Kelly ends up getting the upper hand, in true Hollywood fashion, albeit in a way that Hollywood would never allow. All of Fuller's films are didactic treatises where his characters, usually outcasts and reprobates, do the things that `good people' should do, but are too fearful to do. A Fullerian antihero walks the walk that typical Hollywood characters are only willing to talk. Fuller empathizes with the lowlifes in his films, even as he condemns their lifestyles, taking the most Christian ideal of loving the sinner while hating the sin to heart. Of course, there is a big ethical difference between harmless prostitution and wicked pedophilia, yet it is prostitution that gets a dressing down as a social evil from Kelly, while pedophilia merely gets a death blow, and no such direct address. Fuller also takes a very unique approach to triteness by not just using clichs but wallowing in their excesses until they have to be accepted as part of his slightly askew universe. Only then does he show his traces of originality.

  Still, many of his metaphors are too forced- such as his equation of Grant's pedophilia with the hypocrisy and sexual repression of the townsfolk. It's as if one is to believe that the evils of pre-sexual liberation mores were behind Grant's perversion. Only Fuller could be daring enough to cover such a topic- as well as prostitution and abortion, yet do so in the most hackneyed ways playing against the most direct and honest. It is this meshing of disparate methods that makes Fuller so unique, even when at his worst and most pedantic. This carries over into his film style, where he is a primitive, artistically. The camerawork by cinematographer Stanley Cortez is often wobbly, off-kilter, out of focus, full of glare, and the editing is often bizarre. The soon to be released DVD, put out by The Criterion Collection, is a vast improvement over both their earlier release of the film, and a cheapo version put out by Passion Productions. While the print is very good, and on par with the earlier releases, this DVD has some good extras; unfortunately, an audio commentary is not one of them. Considering the rise of Netflix and on demand films, one would hope that the vaunted Criterion would realize that extras are the very reason people still buy DVDs. Aside from an insert booklet that features excerpts from Fuller's memoir, A Third Face, there is an essay by film critic Robert Polito. The actual extras include the original theatrical trailer (in all its hammy glory), an in depth interview with Constance Towers- who praises Fuller's ability to tell such a sexual story, by film historian Charles Dennis, from 2007, three television interview excerpts with Fuller, from England and France; all of which lend insights into the man and his work. The film score, by Paul Dunlap, wavers between the laughably predictable blaring jazz of B films of that time, especially in its opening sequence, to its pompous Classical interludes, to its retread 1940s film melodrama set pieces, to the downright awful kids' song, Bluebird Of Happiness, being replayed when Kelly discovers Grant with his niece. The use of characters with names like Candy, Griff (a name used in almost all Fuller films, based upon a dead war buddy of his), Dusty, Kip, Buff, Bunny, and Hatrack- played by future schlock star of Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls, Edy Williams, only emphasizes how willing Fuller was to go over the top, so that he could slip in his morality plays with less suspicion and more ease, by distracting would be censors with red herrings.

  Yet, compared to such stiff moralistic Hollywood fare as Charles Laughton's Night Of The Hunter, which also deals with child abuse, one can see why a film like this chose to go over the top to slip in its medicine with such candied fluff. The Naked Kiss is anomic, leaves many of its scenes open to interpretation, is over-simplistic, ahead of its time, trite, yet also has moments of true human emotion. It is the definition of that work of art which is definitely not great, but, in a sense, essential, for it perfectly distills the contradictions of a time between the repressed black and white morality of the Cold War 1950s and the sludgy gray of the coming morass of Civil Rights Era abuses and mass murder in Vietnam. But, when all of that is said and one, it's just a fun film to watch, beyond any analysis, and that's a rare enough quality in any age.",3.0
"Constance Towers is a lady who exudes ""class,"" which is a kind way of saying that she was really miscast in the role of a  prostitute in THE NAKED KISS.

 In this 1964 release from writer-director Samuel Fuller, Ms. Towers plays a hooker who moves to a small town and decides to change her life.  She goes to work as a nurse's aide in a hospital for disabled children and also, over a period of time, falls in love with the town's leading, wealthiest citizen (Michael Dante), who turns out not to be such a prize catch after all.  Anthony Eisley plays a gritty local cop who knows her secret, and Virginia Grey is the madam of the local brothel, who doesn't have a ""heart of gold"".

 In its day, THE NAKED KISS was quite the shocker.  It dealt with (or hinted at) such then-taboo subjects as prostitution, abortion and even pedophilia in bold ways that were foreign to American film audiences.  Unfortunately, like many once-controversial movies, the handling of these topics are now so dated that, at times, they are almost laughable.

  The opening sequence with Towers beating up her pimp with her shoe, and an unexpected plot twist mid-film are still quite effective, but for the most part, the obviously low budget movie is filled with staid dialogue, performances and direction.

 Actually, the best part of this DVDs is not the movie, but the extras, a feast for fans of Sam Fuller.  It features an engrossing, fairly recent on-camera interview with Ms. Towers, who looks terrific, and three lengthy documentaries about or interviews with Fuller.

The film has received a new, high-definition digital transfer from Criterion.

He followed up in 1964 with this even more brutal story of small town corruption. Fuller's films from this era were pulp novels brought to the screen, hard-hitting stories of troubled and troubling souls, laced with over-the-top physical and emotional violence and twisted by mawkish sentimentality.

The Naked Kiss tells the story of a big city prostitute who finds small town America no place to reform. Try as she might to leave her past behind, the dark secrets of her adopted Grantville, and the cathouse across the river, continue to dog her. Fuller shot this on the cheap, and the cardboard quality of the back lot settings add wonderfully to the feeling that everything and everyone is projecting a faade. The uneven pacing - some scenes languish, some cut sharply - gives the picture an emotional jumpiness that matches its subject, and Fuller's uses close-ups to startle the viewer into direct confrontation with the protagonists.

Fuller's script bluntly weighs the relative morality of prostitution, corruption, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and child abuse. The acting is just as sensationalistic as the themes, with Constance Towers as a hooker whose hardened exterior hides a sensitive intellect within. Not the stereotype hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold, but a human being with external awareness of her own predicaments. The male leads, Anthony Eisley as the police captain and Michael Dante as the love interest, are just the opposite, professionals who harbor dark, predatory secrets within.

This is by no means fine cinema, but it makes good on Fuller's philosophy that film is all about emotion. Even the oddly staged musical number is part of the creep show as Towers, having settled into a job as a nurse at a children's orthopedic hospital, practices with her physically crippled charges. Fuller spared no cinematic effort - within his miniscule budgets - in provoking viewers, and his journalistic storytelling combines with black-and-white cinematography to keep a believable edge on even the most outlandish elements of the script. Critereon's DVD includes the original theatrical trailer as the only bonus. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2009 hyperbolium dot com]",3.0
"Maverick American filmmaker Sam Fuller was both a progressive and a prude, and no film of his better illustrates this schismic personal dichotomy, echoed in his art's use of high and low techniques, than his 1964 black and white film noir melodrama The Naked Kiss, a cult classic whose title derives from its lead character, a prostitute named Kelly, who describes the kiss of the fiance she kills, that way, meaning she could tell he was a sexual deviant from the get go. It's a film that has brilliance, inanity, memorable scenes of realism, and trite predictable scenes of sheer fantasy- such as the mention of the titular act, which is not real, but works symbolically to explain certain elements of the lead character's behavior.
  That lead character, a hooker named Kelly, is played by B film mainstay Constance Towers, whose decades of acting in low budget films gave her the limited sort of celebrity appeal that only grows with time. For the last few years more people have become familiar with her role as the evil Helena Cassadine on the ABC soap opera General Hospital than in all her previous roles combined, but The Naked Kiss may be her most memorable film role. The film opens with a bang- a shot of Kelly beating the crap out of a man with her purse. He's her pimp, Farland, but he has been cheating her. After she knocks him out she takes only the $75 owed to her, and not a penny more. But, in their struggle, he pulls off her wig, to reveal her as bald. He has shaved her as an act of revenge for a perceived betrayal. It is one of the most kinetic and memorable openings in film history. After getting her money, Kelly puts her wig back on, while looking in a mirror and primping, as the title credits roll. Already, Fuller has set up the character as a `bad girl', but one with scruples. She will be the classic `hooker with a heart of gold', but Fuller goes beyond the stereotype, although he does so only by saturating the viewer with so many other stereotypes and clichs that one is forced to deal with the surfeit as its own raison d'etre.
  Only Fuller's films run the gamut from low brow Ed Wood-like total crap to great moments and writing that rival the best moments in a Stanley Kubrick or Martin Scorsese film. Yet, he never had total control over any of his material. Even his magnum opus, the terrific war film The Big Red One, was butchered by its studio, and not restored until nearly a quarter century later. Similarly, The Naked Kiss was butchered to a point where Fuller threatened to have his name removed from it. In some ways, this film superficially resembles Federico Fellini's Nights Of Cabiria, save that Kelly ends up getting the upper hand, in true Hollywood fashion, albeit in a way that Hollywood would never allow. All of Fuller's films are didactic treatises where his characters, usually outcasts and reprobates, do the things that `good people' should do, but are too fearful to do. A Fullerian antihero walks the walk that typical Hollywood characters are only willing to talk. Fuller empathizes with the lowlifes in his films, even as he condemns their lifestyles, taking the most Christian ideal of loving the sinner while hating the sin to heart. Of course, there is a big ethical difference between harmless prostitution and wicked pedophilia, yet it is prostitution that gets a dressing down as a social evil from Kelly, while pedophilia merely gets a death blow, and no such direct address. Fuller also takes a very unique approach to triteness by not just using clichs but wallowing in their excesses until they have to be accepted as part of his slightly askew universe. Only then does he show his traces of originality.
  Still, many of his metaphors are too forced- such as his equation of Grant's pedophilia with the hypocrisy and sexual repression of the townsfolk. It's as if one is to believe that the evils of pre-sexual liberation mores were behind Grant's perversion. Only Fuller could be daring enough to cover such a topic- as well as prostitution and abortion, yet do so in the most hackneyed ways playing against the most direct and honest. It is this meshing of disparate methods that makes Fuller so unique, even when at his worst and most pedantic. This carries over into his film style, where he is a primitive, artistically. The camerawork by cinematographer Stanley Cortez is often wobbly, off-kilter, out of focus, full of glare, and the editing is often bizarre. The DVD, put out by Passion Productions, has no extras, but the print is surprisingly high in quality- better than some of the titles put out by bigger companies like Fox-Lorber or The Criterion Collection.
  Yet, compared to such stiff moralistic Hollywood fare as Charles Laughton's Night Of The Hunter, which also deals with child abuse, one can see why a film like this chose to go over the top to slip in its medicine with such candied fluff. The Naked Kiss is anomic, leaves many of its scenes open to interpretation, is over-simplistic, ahead of its time, trite, yet also has moments of true human emotion. It is the definition of that work of art which is definitely not great, but, in a sense, essential, for it perfectly distills the contradictions of a time between the repressed black and white morality of the Cold War 1950s and the sludgy gray of the coming morass of Civil Rights Era abuses and mass murder in Vietnam. But, when all of that is said and one, it's just a fun film to watch, beyond any analysis, and that's a rare enough quality in any age.",3.0
"I like Bill Pullman and Diane Lane which is why I bought this movie.  The plot is reasonably close to the book, but the small budget shows.",3.0
"Well, I rented this movie from the library based on reviews here. Definitely some interesting aspects to this movie, but it is a message movie. The acting is kind of wooden; everyone is playing their roles in this morality drama. The sexual double entendres are clumsy...this is not Bogart and Bacall. It is definitely more frank than a lot of movies in terms of issues raised, but it's not like the story arises from a Leave It To Beaver kind of atmosphere. The small town of Grantville she comes to seems almost like a community that's been nuked. Hardly any people around. Maybe he just couldn't get enough extras, but there's no warmth to this town. I see it more as sort of an early exurbian town, you really don't know people yet, and where people are on the move a lot and no one knows each other. The brothel is ""across the river."" Anyway, I would group it with other morality message movies of the 50s and 60s. A lot of heavy symbolism. Has almost an Invasion of the Body Snatchers feel to it (the original one). The final scene, with the close ups of these anguished faces that are really hard to read...that was great. Close up faces of anger and fear, as many message movies would do at that time (kind of like ""The Miracle Worker,"" too). Those faces stick with you as she walks down a completely abandoned street.",3.0
"A Gratin of spastic awkward forced contoversy fisting its way stiffly through its 1950's girdle, Naked Kiss seeks to be a controversial film yet doesn't feel remotely real in any way. Comically sad and stiffly acted, it is the epitome of a 1950's ""B"" movie (although a ""B"" may be somewhat kind) it is the vegas lounge singer of movies not purposefully campy or kitsch, it truly tries to get off the ground but has no wings... or legs for that matter yet it nobly pushes forth its best effort and THAT is the stuff of which genres are born.

In many ways, this film is kind of what the transition between the '50's & '60's were about. An awkward attempt to grow up too fast without knowing how. We get to watch the spasmotic growing pains of the ""Me generation"" pushing farther & faster than they can handle.

Come for the cheese, stay for the quirkyness.",3.0

"Great to have finally received the second season of Police Story but as some recent reviewers have mentioned,the quality of this DVD set falls short of the season one set. I have only watched the first episode so far and have quickly skimmed through many others. I can concur that the picture appears quite faded and running time for each episode is just over 46 minutes (cut down about four minutes) except for the extended last episode. The Columbia/Sony fanfare in the closing titles looks around early 1990s and maybe this is the best quality masters Sony had available for Shout Factory. Or, maybe there was no real effort to put together a complete and restored version.
If the first episode is anything to go by, the story lines for the rest of the season should still be good but the quality of the actual DVD set makes me feel that a price of well under $20 would more realistic. If the rest of the available masters are of the same quality then could be an opportunity for Mill Creek Entertainment to release them instead.

"""Police Story"" wasn't my favorite Jackie Chan movie, but nobody can deny that its action, humor, and stunts were enough to raise anybody's eyebrows. Alas, much of what made the original film memorable has been undone in the sequel, to the point of there being almost no comparison between the two. It's still a pretty good action film by most standards, but nonetheless a disappointing follow-up to one of the genre's most appreciated masterpieces.

The story: the returning Ka Kui (Chan) is still a policeman, but the exploits of the previous adventure have gotten him demoted from hero to zero. On top of this, the villainous Mr. Chu (Chor Yuen) has been released from prison and promises to make life miserable for him and his unstable girlfriend May (Maggie Cheung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Mood-for-Love/dp/B000065R29/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Mood for Love</a>)...all whilst the police department is faced with a case involving the theft of $10 million from building tycoons by demolition-savvy terrorists.

The movie switches between an action vehicle and a police thriller more than once, with wire-planting and surveillance scenes taking precedence frequently. Frankly, I don't watch a Jackie Chan movie for stuff like that, and when it starts going on for half-hours at a time, I start losing interest. Granted, it all comes back to some good martial arts scenes, but for the most part, the film takes itself a bit too seriously (the original also did, but at least it could make up for it on a more regular basis). The only non-action aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed was the continuation of Jackie's and Maggie's onscreen relationship, which peaked in a hilarious scene where Maggie shouts Chan through a shower room filled with naked, embarrassed policemen and corners him in a bathroom stall. Besides that, there's less physical comedy from Jackie, and that's not cool.

I shouldn't complain too much, though. There is a lot of cool action to fall back on...it's just not as cool as that of the original. Chan has four hand-to-hand fights: the first one against Chu's thugs in a restaurant, and while still entertaining, it's nothing we haven't seen from Jackie before (although there is a cool move where he breaks an open drawer with a man's face); the next is a more inventive follow-up fight in a park where Chan takes on an even larger group of attackers wielding metal sticks. He then has a brawl with two CID agents that's too short to warrant interest, but the movie ends on a high note with Chan taking on the three terrorists in a fireworks factory; this one includes the vast majority of the film's stuntwork (comprised of Chan the bad guys falling from very high places) and a rather impressive fight between Ka Kui and Benny Lai (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Strike-Force/dp/B00008XRV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Strike Force</a>) as a deaf-mute pyromaniac.

Dragon Dynasty did a reasonably good job with the special features of this release, though they apparently shared all of the good stuff with the prequel: included are two Cantonese audio tracks and one English track in which Chan does not do his own dubbing, feature commentary by Brett Ratner and Bey Logan, a 33-minute tribute to the Jackie Chan stunt team, alternate outtakes, a location guide, and a Ratner/Logan interview...but no personal words from Chan himself. This uneven comparison shows that even Hong Kong has its problems with having sequels live up to their predecessors, and not even director Chan could shatter that stereotype. If you're a fan of Jackie's, you'll already own this, but newcomers to Dragon Dynasty should start somewhere else, regardless of the name recognition.",3.0

"I was pretty disappointed with this sequel. I know usually the second movie is not as good as the first, but I still couldn't help but look forward to this one, only to be let down. It seems Jackie Chan focused a lot more on story and humor, and there isn't that much action. Mind you, the action that is there is good, but you can't help but think it could have been so much more. To me, this movie is throwaway and forgettable. It just made me want to go watch the first again...",3.0
"Police Story 2 follows the first film in many aspects, characters, tone, romance, and comedy, but what it leaves out is most of the fantastic fights and great stunts (although in typical fashion the finale is something to behold!).  Most of the same cast is back and it's always fun watching Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung hamming it up as a dysfunctional yet loving couple.  The villians are as despicable as you would expect a group of terrorist bombers to be and you'll definately be looking forward to them getting there heads kicked in by the end.  All that being said, sequels are suppossed to up the ante and be bigger and better... that doesn't happen here, but how could it?  The first film is a masterpiece while this is merely good (I feel the same about The Drunken Master and it's sequel).  Fans of the usual American action films should be blown away... but for those already familiar with Hong Kong film-making this is an enjoyable movie, just don't go in expecting anything too special.",3.0

"Unfortunately this is one of the VERY lesser releases from The Criterion Collection. First, the video transfer, in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio, is from a really bad source, and the film is at a mediocre ten year old VHS tape quality, laden with lines, scratches, ghosts, blobs, and assorted other imperfections- the worst reel is the `dream sequence.' What is puzzling is how Criterion has boasted , in the past, of restoring film quality to films that were far better, to begin with. As example are the re-releases for Seven Samurai and Federico Fellini's Amarcord, whose initial releases had a quality of 90-95 (on a scale of 100, and the rerelease upped that about 5 points. By contrast, this release of Drunken Angel is at a substandard 55-60. Granted, the costs of this would be far more daunting than the tweaks given to the other films, but....is not that the supposed stated reason Criterion exists? If all we were to get was a half-assed job, then perhaps this could be an Image Entertainment release? The audio portion of this release is not much better. Naturally, no English language dubbed track exists either, and Criterion continues its misguided policy of using white subtitles for a black and white film which often makes reading them an exercise in eyestrain.

  The supplements are a bit better, with a 31 minute long making of documentary on the film, part of the Toho Masterworks series Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful To Create. It has some interesting information, but the better feature is Kurosawa And The Censors, a 25 minute long video piece that looks at what Kurosawa faced from American propagandists, while shooting the film, and how that was similar yet different from the censorship he faced under the militarist years of Japan. There's also an insert booklet with an essay by cultural historian Ian Buruma, and excerpts from Kurosawa's memoir, Something Like An Autobiography. Then there is an audio commentary by the hit and miss Japanese film historian Donald Richie, who relates how he was on the set for the filming of Drunken Angel, the first time he was ever invited to do so, and where he first met Kurosawa. It's an ok commentary from Richie, who manages to be hit and miss within a single commentary- usually he's on the mark or rambles off into his own hermetic world of memories. While almost never scene specific with comments, Richie does make some good points, but he also makes some key errors. As example, he feels the film is a bit didactic and preachy, but this really isn't the case. Dr. Sanada is didactic, but the film is not. The film is rather impassive toward its inhabitants. On the other hand, the film does have some flaws, like reveling in American gangster clichs, that Richie does not expound upon. He does pick up on something that I noticed right away, that the film is set in summer, but was filmed in January- thus why characters are seen in light wear, but their breath is visible in the air. But then he gaffes by claiming Sanada and Matsunaga are opposite sides of the same coin. But they are clearly not. Sharing some similarities does not make a pair of individuals part of the same coin. The two men have differing temperaments, philosophies, habits, and goals. Overall, though, it's a solid performance by Richie.

  The same can be said for Drunken Angel. It has flaws (as I've detailed above), and they are manifest; the worst of them being a dream sequence where the consumptive Matsunaga emerges from a casket to chase himself on a shoreline. This was done better a decade later, in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, and over three decades later in Kurosawa's own Kagemusha. But, it also deftly uses symbolism, visual and musical, and this overcomes its occasional fall into gangster clichs. Kurosawa, himself, felt that this was his first `real' film, the first unencumbered by interference from outside sources. Thus, it is like its creator, a thing aborning, and while that fact does not mitigate the film's flaws, it does add a bit more to some scenes and actions, for the cineaste, for it adds a duplicity to them: one sees both the flaw and imagines how the older, better Kurosawa would have handled such a scene. And, let's face facts; given that it's Kurosawa, even his biggest flaws are better than the greatest merits of many lesser filmmakers. Thus, the word interesting has more aptness than good, bad, or variants thereof. Take that not as a copout, but an observation, flaws notwithstanding.",3.0

I am not an actor, but I can imagine the hard work and effort it takes to eke out a living in Hollyblood.  this isn't a blockbuster, and it never will be, but I expected a touch of reality. Perhaps it's best I didn't get what I expected. A few genuine moments of laughter, when the seemingly endless frustration leads to a chance.  The thing is, this film sort of struggles much as the cast members portray, so why on earth would they want to work so hard for no visible gain?  DeAngelo didn't do her lovely hair any justice by the stupid looking hot red wig, that's for certain.  That bit sort of aged her.  Poor makeup choice.
There were some great puns and some moments of regret. The best performance was given by Garry Marshall, in his walk on role.  I still haven't figured out why Elle McPherson was in this film, she may be a great model, but an actor? Oh please. Junior High School play, maybe.
All in all, I enjoyed the film because i had lowered my expectations going in. That's the 3 star retreat. Not sure I loved it, but I couldn't slam it with only one *.  Still, you have to be a fan of B films to watch this again.  So a one-time look is all I get.",3.0

Furthermore, no one enters heaven because they ""deserve"" to do so (as a little boy was told about his dad in this film), though Hollywood insissts on promulgating that lie in film after film.

"Touted as supernatural thriller / film noir, FALLEN hasn't dated well at all.  The truth is: the show while beautifully filmed, is too tame and slow to generate any real thrills.

The only reason to watch this movie of course is Denzel Washington - who's never had a bad performance.  The able cast around him - Donald Sutherland, John Goodman, James Gandolfini et al - don't do much either.  The film is ultimately very PG in treatment, which works against it.  Denzel fans will get their fix, but that's about it.

"I knew almost nothing about this movie before watching it, but I decided to give it a try since Denzel Washington is a first-rate actor who's work I've always enjoyed.  In this movie, once again, he delivers, and the other actors are good too.

The plot involves an evil spirit which moves from body to body, killing people along the way.  A police detective played by DW eventually figures out what's happening, and he comes up with a plan to kill the evil spirit itself.  You can watch the movie to see how it turns out ...

As far as deeper meaning, the main message I discerned is that maybe reality is stranger than we realize or can even imagine, and maybe that's why no one can explain why there's so much evil in the world.

But overall, this movie is meant to entertain rather than teach anything, and the entertainment is in the genre of what I would call 'scary suspense'.  Though I found this movie gripping, with plenty of unexpected twists, this isn't a genre I care for, so my personal rating is only 3 stars.  But if you like this genre, you'll probably like this movie too.",3.0
"Denzel does a great job playing a police detective trying to solve a string of murders. I liked how the script mixed a supernatural thriller with a classic serial killer police film. I thought the cast did a good job of acting their roles. One of the best things I liked about the film was the end and that it's a bit of a shock

I don't have a ton of bad things to say about this film,but here is a few. I love Denzel,but he seems to play the same character in all his film,the smart,intelligent,heroic black man. I'd love to see him act a bit different in some of these films or at least play an extremely different type of character. Also all the actors did a good job,but none of them really stood out to me. There is nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before in films like this where a killer has the ability to jump bodies even though it's done well. Also I would have liked the main villain to have had more motivation rather than I'm a evil dude that likes killing. I kind of like my main bad guys to have some kind of motivations or plan for why they are doing what they are doing.

"I really tried hard to get into this movie, but I just couldn't I was like . . . well I thought he was alive in the introducton/voiceover.  But at the end he was already dead.  Was he the devil or was he not? John Goodman did a good job playing the unknown devil's advocate. But I was like Mmm.... I don't know about this one.  I really am not comfortable with movies that address's The recurring motif ""Good verses Evil"" especially when the Good guy turns out to be the evil one.(Denzel) Fallen.  Was this movie a testament of his Moral Convictions?  Or was it just another Movie Block Buster that all stars choose to play when a Movie like ""The Sixth Sense"" pulls in the BIG BUCKS!  Denzel is a sort Save the World--Good Guy, and not ""I'm fallen spiritually--morally, and I can't get back up""  I really did not find this movie that entertaining.  I guess the only reason that I watched it so long--was because Denzel Washington just looked so Damn! good on the movie screen.

"As a suspenseful mystery, FALLEN is a great movie (though if you are observant the movie's twist is revealed in its opening scene). However, the last act nullifies the movie's good moments.

The entire premise of the movie is totally un-Biblical and anytime a film uses a Biblical concept (demons) then totally twists it around without regard to the source, it is diminished in my eyes. Also, the movie is a wicked movie, wicked in the sense of its overpowering evil and the fact that there is no catharsis. Movies like that just aren't very entertaining to watch.

Nevertheless, there are a couple of reasons to watch FALLEN. First, there is Denzel Washington; he's just a fascinating actor to watch perform. However, the main reason to watch this film are because of its supporting actors: John Goodman and Donald Sutherland. They outshine Washington in almost every scene.

If you enjoyed THE EXORCIST, you may like this movie. It's also worth watching if you're a Washington or Goodman or Donald Sutherland fan. Other than that, I'd reccommend watching something that leaves your emotions purged instead of pent up.",3.0

"The script of this film is fantastic. It begins in the classic 3 act structure whereby act 1 introduces you to the story. We start off with Denzel running in the snow and his internal thoughts being translated to us through voice over. He carefully states that he is in a near death experience, but because of the style of the genre that we have become used to, we assume that Denzel is going to die.
Act 2 takes us back into the life of Denzel prior to the moment when we engage with him at the beginning of the film. He works alongside his colleague, John Goodman, in a police station, and they are both eventually possessed by an evil spirit, or more rightly termed, a fallen angel. John Goodman becomes the antagonist possessed with the fallen angel, out to take possession of Denzel. Denzel is forced to impose a slow death on Goodman in the middle of nowhere, and takes a lethal nicotine injection so that when the spirit leaves Goodman and enters inside of him, he is already dead, thus putting an end to the travels of the fallen angel. Once the spirit realises this and enters inside of Denzel, we see Denzel running in the snow as at the beginning of the film.
Then, Act 3 kicks in. We still have in our minds that Denzel is about to die. And he does. But the internalisations that we hear are not the words of Denzel, but the fallen angel. The fallen angel manages to live on beyond Denzel's death by entering inside a white wolf, thereby double crossing the audience through the use of drama synchronised with a familiar voice. A very clever piece of writing.",3.0

"After reading the Hiaasen book (Strip Tease), I was curious about the movie version of the story. While I believe that any movie version cannot reflect favorably all of the background and details of its book form, this movie, in particular did not weave the plot together seamlessly (coherently). If you are not seduced by the visions of the lovely topless Demi Moore, or the Burt Reynold's whacky interpretation of Congressman Dave Dilbeck, you will not find this film compelling.

He's very funny skewering the corrupt politicians, real estate developers, etc., of Florida, he's a champion of the environment, and the endings are always very satisfying. The book STRIPTEASE is no exception. The movie falls quite flat by comparison, which is surprising given the number and size of the bosoms in it.

"The book by Carl Hiassen was awesome - a page turner!  After reading the book, I wanted to watch this old movie that I had
seen when it first came out years ago.  I couldn't even remember the movie so that says something about it.  The King could
hardly stay awake until the end.  But I was more interested in seeing how the story was transformed into the movie.

The movie makers followed the plot and characters pretty closely which was good, until the end, where they seem to have either a)
run out of the alloted 'movie theatre time limit"" or b) ran out of money to finish it properly.  The end in the book was WAY better
and would have saved this movie had they played it out.

Oh, and Demi Moore's dancing ... well it's about the dorkiest thing I've ever seen - ha ha!  And, anybody who's EVER seen a strip
joint and seen real dancers would agree, this is SO far from the mark.  VERY HOKEY.  But I suppose if you're a Demi Moore fan, you might get excited to see her big 'reveal' - they tease you with that until the end.  She does have an awesome body, but she's not very sexy...just sayin'.",3.0
"I can't speak for anyone else, but a for myself, I considered this Movie to be ok, but it's NOT great.  Besides, the Title is "" STRIPTEASE ""; and my Definition of that is the person is going to take Everything OFF, but Demi Moore  DIDN""T take Everything OFF; all she had become was Topless, but that's as far as she had gone.  Because the Title is STRIPTEASE, Demi Moore Should have taken Everything OFF, right down to her Birthday Suit.  How ever had come up with this Title, had made a HUGE Mistake; that's also known as False Advertising!  The word  STRIPTEASE means just like it sounds, taking EVERYTHING OFF, not taking / removing a Percentage { % } of there clothes, BUT Everything; and Demi Moore Didn't take Everything OFF, so that means to me that the person / people that had placed this Title for this film, had Purgerd themselves { Lied }, and Advertised FALSELY!

"It's really unfortunate that most people know this brilliant story only as a mediocre film.  The story was adapted from an absolutely delightful novel written by Carl Hiassen of the Miami Herald.  Having read Strip Tease before seeing the movie, I enjoyed Striptease a lot more than most viewers.  I can understand how people would think the movie missed the mark if judged only by the movie.

Burt Reynolds plays Congressman Dilbeck almost exactly as he's portrayed in the book and he does a fantastic job in the role.  Ving Rhames does a great job playing the bouncer, Shad, at the Eager Beaver.  Unfortunately, the screenwriters' adapted screenplay attempts to make the Erin Grant role a bit more serious than she was in the book and, quite honestly, a more significant character than she was.  Given that ""Strip Tease"" the novel was a dark comedy, having any character delve into the seriously dramatic was not really something I feel Hiassen intended.

Whether talking about the book or the film, do note that this story isn't a sex-fest.  While the story does have a great number of scenes where the strip club is the setting, it's really done in such a way that it's not at all distasteful.  I think that while some of the scenes where Erin was dancing were dragged on for the moviegoers who were just there to see Demi nude, the filmmakers did a commendable job keeping it from becoming entirely about sex and I give them credit for that.  The story could have been slanted an entirely different direction with this kind of story.

For the real story, read the book and you'll enjoy.  The movie makes a lot more sense when you've read the book.  I own the movie and the book and enjoy both.",3.0
"I just watched Striptease last night.  Demi looked amazing!  I don't care how she got that way but her body was incredible.  The dance sequences were great and using the Eurythmics/Annie Lennox songs was a perfect choice.  As for the movie itself it was just an excuse to showcase Demi - the plot, characters, everything was just muddled and confused.  Ving Rhames' character was pretty cool though - very Marcellus Wallace-lite.  All in all this movie is okay if you watch it while having a few margaritas!",3.0

Made when WWII was far from being over and America had just joined the fight - well worth seeing.",3.0

"Gary Grant plays a bit against type as a man who does not wish to work but rely upon the largesse of others and finds if this cannot be achieved to borrow from Peter to pay Paul. He marries an heiress but to his consternation discovers she only has a small stipend to live off and upon the death of her father (who realises the man's true nature) merely suggests that his wife continues to pay the stipend instead of giving her a large sum of money.

"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Why did they not preview THIS ending with the preview audience? Hitch would surely have heard surly snarls and sighs with the mega letdown finale and then would decide to re-shoot the original.

Since there were too many scenes with Joan fumbling for her coke bottle glasses, though she attempts to read EVERY newspaper, letter, or instructions without them, I was certain this aspect would be central to the plot. The milk glass glistening in the stairwell was so strikingly a giveaway, why the other lame distractions? REBECCA was truly a perfect vehicle for Joan as she masterminded the role with the greatness of insight but find it difficult to lend credibility for her in this film.

I could not comprehend the attraction to Grant, the psychotic cad who only had to call her Monkeyface 200 times and love conquers all including death??? A huge misstep for Hitch, he at least should have gone with his instincts, but even that would not save this film from any interesting developments.

Travelling by train he meets what appears to be a conservative librarian prototype.  They exchange a few pleasantries, but he sees her later at a party and eventually meets her again at her house.  Lina (Oscar winner Joan Fontaine) hasn't had a real romance and immediately falls for Johnny (Grant).  Lina's family is loaded.  In the movies all retired British Generals (Cedric Hardwicke) are loaded.  Johnny exists by borrowing money and occasionally winning at the horse track.  They eventually marry, but it is an uneasy partnership.  Johnny is, well Johnny as she's repeatedly told.  He lies, perhaps cheats and is seemingly out for Lina's forthcoming fortune.  We're never quite sure as Hitchcock loads up the film with more than one McGuffin (glass of milk, Lina's eyeglasses) and tries to keep the audience guessing.  Can Cary Grant really be a crook and murderer?  In any case, the film plods along at times and has a clunker of an ending but is worth a look.  If you're a Hitchcock fan, you'll need to see it.",3.0

Suspicion is a very good movie that's utterly torpedoed by a horrible ending which not only leaves a bad taste in the mouth, but renders all the tension and events that had preceded the ending a series of implausible coincidences; blame who you want for the terrible denouement, but don't see this Hitchcock chiller unless you're prepared to be disappointed.",3.0

But why is this film considered a classic? The Cary Grant character was a sleeze. At the beginning, in the middle, and at the end.

There was not one point in the film, including the ending, where I didn't think he was a shyster.

I kept wanting to yell at the screen: Joan, dump this loser! What's he going to do next, sell the family silver? Sell your clothes? Are women that dumb that they would hold on to this hustler?

And I won't even mention the ""monkey face"" thing.

And what was with the suit? Is there one scene in the whole film where Cary doesn't wear the same suit? I thought I was watching a clothing store advertisement after a while.",3.0

"My current reappraisal of the Nightmare on Elm Street series continues....
This, the third film in the series, is admittedly the hardest one for me to share an opinion. It has a pretty decent and engaging story which, unfortunately, the later sequels mostly failed to deliver on. Having said that, the movie definitely has its share of flaws: Heather Langenkamp's character is just patently ridiculous, portrayed as an ""intern therapist"" barely older than her teenage patients! The movie is filled with cringe-worthy cheesy Dokken music, giant glasses, stone washed denim and other period visual atrocities. I know some of the kids out there today seem to worship the 80's for some God forsaken reason, probably because they weren't old enough to actually remember them. But I digress... My point is that it is now extremely dated, somehow looking even more dated than the first two films! The worst thing, though, is how Freddy had changed from a truly horrific figure to a more or less comedy routine - not the least bit scary.
Despite all of those shortcomings the film does remain entertaining for what it is. The Badalamenti score is not cheesy (unlike the Hair Metal), most of the make up effects are still pretty cool, several annoying teens are slaughtered and the origin of Freddy is revealed! Wish me luck as I next delve into Renny Harlin's hack job world of the Dream Master....Part 4",3.0

"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 has Freddy taking on many forms (which is interesting), but this movie feels more like sci-fi than horror. Furthermore, the creators should've made up their minds as to what direction they wanted to go in terms of darkness; this movie yanks us back and forth between darkness and lightness. While there are some memorable scary moments in this movie, there aren't enough to keep your interest for a 98 minute movie. Finally, this movie has the feel and look (at times) of two very famous horror films (The Shining, The Thing 1982) in terms of special effects. This third installment in the series is just as inferior as the second, and just as unnecessary. This movie is simply a special effects extravaganza, and distracting at that.  The plot vehicle (dreams becoming real) is unique for the horror genre, but unfortunately the acting is subpar in supporting it. Overall, this movie is very mediocre, as it doesn't capture the imagination like the first movie. Here, the imagination is handed to us via all of the 'goodies.' On a positive note, Freddy is resonating as usual.",3.0

Truth be known it wasn't near as sex-filled as I expected it to be. Sure there was sex, and a good deal of nudity, but not much more than many films. It was more of a drama heavy with sex, than a sex film heavy on drama. I quite liked it though it did run a good 30 minutes longer than it needed to.

"This is a film about young, very beautiful people having sex.  You have a libertine doctor, who attracts women like flies and treats them like flies.  Indeed, his fly is rarely zipped.  He has an amazing lover, Lena Olin in her prime, but then he meets a serious girl (Binoche).  Which woman a male viewer prefers is a great rorschach test.  Oh, and the background is the Prague Spring of 1968, all the way through the Soviet crackdown.

Unfortunately, this is far closer to pornography than the psychological and political masterpiece that is Kundera's philosophical novel.  Indeed, there is very little explanation of the characters' motivations.  For example, in the book, it is clear that the doctor is both afraid of women and angry at them, having just lost his daughter in a bad divorce - it is the key to his character and there is nothing about that in the film.  The same can be said of his women, however lovely they are.  And the politics?  It is merely events that occur as if in passing, changing their situations but with little else to say.

"Wes Craven comes back, guns a blazing.  He didn't direct, but acted as producer and co-writer.  This story follows the logic of the first movie much more closely, but there's almost too much plot.  The characters are thinly drawn, with one or two easy to remember characteristics.  (This is actually more than some Friday the 13th characters get, so maybe it's not worth complaining about.)  What makes the movie compelling is the special effects.  Unlike the previous two entries, Dream Warriors really pulls out the stops.  Showpieces include stop motion animation, a giant animatronic Freddy worm head, and a series of climactic mirror gags that totally stumped me.  Those are some good optical effects.",3.0
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being is one of those occasional attempts by American filmmakers to make a European arthouse movie in English, in this case taking on an `unfilmable' novel and trying to solve the problem of turning inner monologue into a credible narrative. Despite, or perhaps because of Jean-Claude Carriere's presence as co-writer with director Philip Kaufman, this tends to take the form of the odd conversation between shags rather than an attempt to turn ideas into images, leaving a rather conventional narrative about a philandering surgeon who ultimately needs the oppression of the Russian invasion rather than the freedom of the Czech Spring to focus his emotional commitments and principles. Some of this is done well, some of it less well, but at the end of the day it's just a love story, although it deals well with the personal consequences of the political crackdown and the ending is quietly moving. Which, in a way, reflects some kind of emotional triumph - whereas for most of the film we don't really care for the characters, merely go along with them, by the end, like he hero, we have at least attained some genuine level of emotional commitment.

Whether that entirely justifies 171-minutes of screen time is debatable, though in its defense the film never feels that long. There are moments that grate, not least the sporadically clumsy integration of the main characters into archive footage of the Russian invasion that draws attention to itself by the crude device of adding scratches only to the new footage. The photography session doesn't quite work either despite an interesting start, not quite pulling off the shift of power and veering off into self-indulgence. The performances are slightly problematic too, especially with the Czechs limited to the smaller supporting roles in an Anglo-French-Swedish-American cast leading to a variety of composite accents (often more Germanic than Slav) and a feeling that the casting directors thought ""Yeah, he sounds foreign, he'll do"" at times. Daniel Day Lewis fares well as the coldly charismatic and fickle doc but still hadn't shrugged off that well-trained British stage actor feel to his performances; Juliette Binoche is genuinely appealing in one of her more open performances, although it's a bit of a stretch that her character never loses her naivet&eacute;; but as the more passionate of his loves Lena Olin is somewhat more problematic, her performance getting less convincing as the film progresses until rediscovering its humanity in her final scene. Of the supporting players, Erland Josephon has one good scene as a former ambassador reduced to being a janitor that underlines the way that even love and sex can be used as weapons of political oppression merely through the introduction of doubt - an idea that becomes strangely more powerful because of the way Kaufman frequently fails to summon up much in the way of eroticism because he generally regards sex as joyfully comic.

Annoyingly the film has been split across two discs, although the break isn't quite as abrupt as on some other discs. The DVD boasts a good transfer with an interesting audio commentary and good half hour documentary that illustrates that even if they didn't entirely succeed at least the filmmakers were trying to create something of real substance.",3.0

"I know it's not really fair to compare a book to a movie, and I've heard before that if you're interested in both you should always see the film first, that way you're not let down with the way it was adapted from the novel.  But in this case, I read the novel first so it's impossible for me to not judge the film in that light.

I don't know whether to blame the casting or the acting/direction, but I wasn't happy with any of the main characters.  Daniel Day Lewis, who I normally like, plays Tomas with a constant smirk on his face that makes him hard to take seriously.  In the novel, he's an intellectual, but in the movie he seems like nothing more than a confused male who's obsessed with sex.

Juliette Binoche's Tereza seems like a caricature.  In the book, she's a sad, somewhat innocent woman from a small Czech town.  In the movie she's played like a typical French ingenue.  She seems like she would fit better into Amelie than she does in Kundera's masterpiece.

Lena Olin's Sabina is not as bad, but she still seems to lack the sensuality or seriousness of the character in the novel.

Of course, there are many things that are left out from the book, and that is to be expected in any adaptation.  The movie doesn't spend very much time on Sabina in Switzerland.  The character of Franz is just glossed over, and the part about Tomas having a wife and son is completely left out, which may seem forgiveable, but in reading the book I thought the fact that Tomas had been in a failed marriage made his womanizing a little more understandable.

None of this is to say that the movie is without merit.  There are some spectacular scenes and moments, and it's hard not to be touched at times.  But it all just feels a little rushed, even in 3 hours.  This could have easily been a mini-series and perhaps then the characters could have been developed properly and the viewer would get to know Tomas and Tereza.  As it is, it's a good movie that in the end comes off feeling like a slightly less erotic version of ""Last Tango in Paris.""",3.0

"I tend to enjoy some goofy, campy horror from time to time and throughout most of this one, I enjoyed it. Parts were just too silly in my opinion. I wasn't sure if the movie was taking itself seriously or if it was intended to be a joke. I think it should have been more clear one way or the other. I like it when goofy horrors make fun of themselves, but it wasn't clear during some of this movie if that was the case.

I think there is definitely a decline since the first and second movies here. I've seen bits of sequels after this one and I can't say I'm even interested they seem so ridiculous. I think they should have laid it to rest after this one, save for the New Nightmare years after this. That one just might be the best in the series after the original and it is clear that it's making fun of itself throughout, instead of leaving me to wonder.

Overall, it was just ok. I don't think I'll watch it again though. Even alone in the dark during a thunderstorm (I really couldn't have done more for ambiance), I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the poor acting and pathetic script writing.",3.0

"My dad, ever the moralist, never allowed me to watch Freddy Krueger movies as a kid. He said that they led to the discrimination against burn victims, and that he would take no part in that. So I'm in catch up mode with this series. This is the second that I've seen in the series after I watched the original a few months ago. Overall, it is a step down, though not a massive one. Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) from the original is brought in as a savior of sorts to a bunch of kids in a psych ward placed there because of ""suicide"" attempts. Patricia Arquette, looking surprisingly hot in her younger days, takes on the role of Kristen who is our main character here. From there everything else is pretty much predictable. Kids try not to fall asleep, they eventually do, Freddy slices and dices. Only in this chapter the goofiness factor is turned up full blast. Look, there's Freddy up in the sky playing the role of puppet master, oh and now he has turned into a TV set, and now a creepy little doll. There is also this terrible little twist that these kids gain certain powers when they fall asleep. The scene in which they come together for a group dream so that they can show off their powers couldn't have fallen any flatter for me. I am also hoping that somebody could explain to me the scene in which one of the kids turns into the ""Wizard Master"" and shoots a very 1980's pre-CGI green lightning bolt out of his hand to destroy a murderous wheelchair Freddy had turned loose on him. . .because I'm at a loss. To me that scene captures everything wrong with this film. Also, the less said about the scene where Freddy's skeleton comes to life the better.

But under all this kookiness there are some good messages to be found here. We, of course, get the traditional, fight your fears and believe in teamwork. But we also get the more unconventional lesson of never listen to your elders because they don't know what the hell they are talking about. Throughout this film (and the original) every decision made by a figure of authority turns out to be dead wrong. Here the only things more evil than Freddy are the clueless authority figures who serve the kids up to him with their idiocy. On the flipside we also get the kids who are punished for ""Overt sexuality"" (shock!). One if left for dead with Freddy after chasing after an easy, eager blond. The director, Chuck Russell, does find time for a striptease first. I guess he'll be sex on Freddy's hit list. I do wish that I could go back in time and enjoy this film for what it is. But my eyes have seen too many movies and have turned critical on me. So I know that the acting here is bad and the special effects (which are used liberally) are so horrible your jaw will drop. There is a kinetic energy at work here that makes it an easy pill to swallow.  I will also admit that the silliness here does cut both ways. Most of the kills are borderline brain dead, but they are also interesting and eye-catching. Russell wasn't shy about screwing this one up, and oddly enough I admire him for that. **3/4",3.0
"For me, the second one was absolutely diabolical, and seeing as I'd just bought the seven disc set, I was angry, and reluctant to watch the rest. I was persuaded, and found myself actually enjoying Dream Warriors. It continues on a few years after the first one, and it's like the second one never happened, as there's no apparent reference to it.

Dream Warriors is made all the better for a higher budget and bringing back Heather Langenkamp. She's definitely an asset to the movies and although she doesn't appear again until the seventh movie (as herself, strangely enough), hopefully the movies will continue the same as this.

A very, very young Patricia Arquette appears in this, her first film, and thankfully she has managed to hone her acting over the years. She's laughable in this. Also look out for ""Larry"" Fishburne!!! Larry, good grief.

The story is basically simple: a young girl (Arquette) is put into a psychiatric ward, with others, who discover they're all dreaming about the same man. They find an understanding adult in the form of Heather, who was of course in the original. She's older, wiser, and specialising in this kinda thing. She tries to help him, but when she finds out Arquette's character can bring others into her dream, they agree to go in and tackle Freddy.

What makes this film better than the second one, is the deaths are becoming bigger and better. One girl dies being put through a TV during Critters - she dreamt of being an actress. Then there's the whole back story to Freddy. We find out his mother was raped repeatedly, and actually appears in the film - a little twist in the plot. He was also never properly buried, and needs to be buried in holy ground, and that will finally get rid of him. Obviously not enough to spawn another 4 sequels.

My suggestion is that you skip the second one, and move straight from part one to part three. Honestly, you will never know the difference. Definitely the best of the series so far. Look out for a severely phallic Freddy snake, and a very cool stop motion puppet.",3.0
"Director:  Chuck Russell

Cast:  Heather Langenkamp, Craig Wasson, Patricia Arquette, Robert Englund, Ken Sagoes, Rodney Eastman, Jennifer Rubin, Laurence Fishburne, John Saxon, Bradley Gregg, Priscilla Pointer.

Running Time:  96 minutes

Rated R for violence, gore, language, and some nudity.

""Dream Warriors"", the third in the seemingly endless ""Elm Street"" series, returns to the ideas and themes of the first film, which is sure to make the fans of the original happy, as ""Part 2: Freddy's Revenge"" is far from being the most popular in the series.  ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3"" is not a bad installment by any means, and there are some magnificent visual ideas throughout, but it's let down by some wooden acting and an unexciting script. Heather Langenkamp isn't a great actress, but she was a good heroine in the first film. Here, as Nancy, she's a little extraneous, and doesn't have much to do except let the new victims know what's in store for them. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" follows the similar formula of the previous films, as a terrified teen named Kristen (Patricia Arquette) is being stalked by a killer in her dreams by the name of Freddy (Robert Englund).  She wakes up without knowing that she slits her wrist and her family decides to send her to a mental hospital for troubled teens. When a new young psychiatrist specializing in Dream Therapy is by the name of Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp).  When Nancy finds out that Freddy stills haunt the frighten teens and knowing what Kristen is talking about. Most of the teens are now dreaming about the killer in their sleep. Nancy and Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) are helping the teens to fight Freddy back with their dream powers and their help.

Once the action moves to the hospital, we're introduced to 'the last of the Elm Street children'. As the original told us, Freddy was killed by a vengeful group of parents who were horrified that this murderer was released from his impending jail sentence on a technicality. Freddy now seeks vengeance by killing the children of those who burned him alive. Here we have a nerd in a wheelchair, a wannabe actress, an ex-drug addict, a sleepwalker, a mute and a cocky sort who always ends up in the quiet room. More or less all of them won't make it to the end, and instead of setting up what could have been a terrifying atmosphere as these kids try to convince those in charge that their 'delusions' are actually real, debut director Chuck Russell throws in big set piece after set piece. Clearly the budget has been upped for Part 3, and the special effects are pretty cool. The dream sequences are also imaginative, especially whenever Kristen is trapped in the old Elm Street house, or when Nancy leads the remaining patients down into Freddy's hellish dungeon. Best of all is a really sinister, very painful-looking scene where one of the victims is turned into what can only be best compared to as a puppet on a string. The last twenty minutes really see the film come alive, featuring a good fight sequence in an abandoned scrap yard.  The music by David Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti has its creepy moments, though the heavy metal cuts by poodle-haired rockers Dokken are the epitome of cheese. The acting is a big problem here: aside from Langenkamp's stilted acting, Craig Wasson is dull as the doctor who takes unorthodox measures to try and help the kids. Patricia Arquette is a bland heroine and the other kids don't have much to do, though when they enter the dream world, a couple of them get to have some cool superpowers. Larry (not Laurence) Fishburne gets an early role as an orderly, and effortlessly out acts nearly everyone in the film. Robert Englund as Freddy has become a full-fledged pantomime villain now, getting a snappy one-liner for every victim he devours. Though not as bad as later chapters like ""The Dream Child"", it's difficult to care much about the characters and the direction lacks energy and spark, yet the film does provide diverting amusement for an hour and a half, and there are some individual great scenes.",3.0
"This movie is okay. I remember totally buying every minute of it when i was a kid in the 80's. Dream Warriors was my fave one.

I even went to the Theatre in my Freddy t-shirt and fake plastic

razor glove to see it.

But being older and having just ordered it and watched it, this one was too COMICAL for me. There's too many Freddy 'One-liners' for my liking. I liked it a lot better in the earlier movies when you could barely see Freddy, he was dark and mysterious, they hardly showed his face.

"This DVD double feature presents two mismatched 1940s horror films: one is quite good, the other a rediculously bad movie worthy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Others here have already summarized the plots and wieghed in their opinions, so foregoing the plots, I'll add my own thoughts about the movies.

THE BODY SNATCHER - is definitely the better of the two. It has no gross-looking corpses or other cheap thrills, instead, the story ""gets under your skin"" with mounting tension and suspense. The acting is superb, and Boris Karloff is particularly creepy as the body snatcher, John Gray. The back-and-forth storytelling between a young girl who requires surgery to reverse the effects of spreading paralysis caused by a tumor, and the doctor who turns to dead bodies to learn his craft is very effective. The story has it all: night-time graveyards, murders, and perhaps even a ghost or two. There's plenty of action and the film's 78 minutes seem to fly by. I was completely absorbed in the very believeable world of 1831 Edinburgh created by the filmmakers.

I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE - on the other hand, was a complete waste of time. The acting, while decent, seemed a bit stiff and forced at times. I never got the same feeling of suspense as I did with ""Body Snatcher."" The movie dragged, and I felt like the plot wasn't going anywhere. On the few occasions where the movie managed to quicken my heartbeat just a bit in anticipation of something about to happen, it turned out to be a false alarm and I was left somewhat disappointed. I never got the same feeling of ""atmosphere"" as other reviews here have pointed out (and I watched it with the lights out on a ""dark and stormy night""). In the second half, the story had really fallen to pieces and when the end came, I was stunned for a few moments--it was wrapped up so quickly and sloppily that I almost couldn't believe it. Many loose ends were left dangling, questions unanswered, and the plot still hadn't really advanced. Among the many questions that shot through my mind at the end of the film, the one that most burned in my mind was ""So what?"" I suppose there's no arguing in matters of taste, particularly when it comes to ""art,"" so I won't raise a fuss with the other reviewers here who claim this picture as a brilliant an inspired work of filmmaking, but I will say that I found it to be a tremendous let-down. I'd recommend renting the movie first. If, after the first fifteen minutes, you find yourself taken with the movie's ""atmosphere"" and ""mood,"" you'll probably like the rest. If, however, like me you wonder ""where is this going?"" or think to yourself ""this is boring,"" you might as well stop there because it doesn't get any better.

The DVD *is* worth a rental--if only for ""The Body Snatchers,"" but ultimately, it's a mixed bag.",3.0
Its ' okay,3.0
"Both these are secondary or B movies  made in the era of double features. The Zombie one is a surprise in not being what the title suggest.  Tom Conway (George Sanders brother) does a solid job as the Husband, and other well known B picture actors are satisfactory. The story involves an ailing wife, a new nurse, the husband's brother, the Boy's mother and assorted singing and acting ""natives"". A no wasted time film which limitation allows the Director not to tarry lovingly over scenes.
The Body Snatcher, stars, in the title role, the inimitable Boris Karloff, and features, Bela Lugosi, the idol of Horror, in a supporting role.  Henry Daniell, another highly accomplished actor, co-stars with a strong performance as the Physician with a past. Karloff and Daniell, in  their roles as antagonists, raise this B picture to a level above most far more expensive A features. This film alone is worth the price of admission despite the weakness of the main supporting role, a student of  Master Physician and Teacher, Daniell.

"Here are two movies from the nine horror films did for RKO Studios in the 1940's. Lewton was hired to produce a series of B horror films for RKO to compete with Universal Studios highly profitable horror and monster films. What RKO was something different. Lewton created films with psychological terror rather than using monsters and the supernatural.

As with I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, Lewton was only given a title to use and the rest was his creation. Although I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE does touch the issues of voodoo and zombies, it again, as in all Lewton films, a study of fear of the unknown. The lovely Frances Dee plays Betsy a nurse sent to work at a plantation house in the Caribbean Island of San Sebastian carrying for the ill wife of the owner. Emotionally detached Paul Holland is played by Ton Conway.  Conway appears in several Lewton films and San Sebastian comes up again in another film. Troubled Wesley Rand is Paul's half brother. Betsy arrives to find Jessica Holland in a catatonic state. She does not speak or react to anyone but is prone to getting up and walking. Locals fear she is a cursed zombie though the local doctor explains her condition as the result of a virulant Caribbean fever that destroyed her mind. Betsy's medical mind is taken over by local superstition as she believes only a voodoo priest can ""cure"" Jessica.

Here again we have a Lewton film centering on the fear of the unknown. What is the truth about Jessica's condition and what about the secret voodoo ceremonies. I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is a psychological thriller and not really a horror film. Everything can be explained scientifically or can it? Sir Lancelot appears in several Lewton films and here he is singing the story of Jessica and her fate. I had never heard of Sir Lancelot but I found out he was a popular Calypso singer who actually popularized this Caribbean form of singing.

I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is compared to Jane Eyre. I can see similarities though the stories diverge completely. Again, we have a servant or nurse in this case who comes to a mysterious household and falls in love with her boss.
Can there be a happy ending with this background? It's an interesting film to watch simply because it is so different. I hadn't heard of Francess Dee and found she was married to actor Joel McCrea. There is a lot of history in old films.

Boris Karloff stars in one of the more creepier and unnerving of the Val Lewton films. There is no mystery here. Karloff stars in the title role of THE BODY SNATCHER. This evil and sinister role gave Karloff a chance to show his acting talents. Evil can also have a tender side as we see Karloff's body snatcher showing kindness to an invalid girl. Yet his sinister side reigns as he supplies bodies for a medical doctor's anatomy classes. Although it is based on a ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON book there is some general historical fact here. What happens when a grave robber has no ""fresh"" bodies to dig up? Working on a very modest budget, Lewton uses the shadows and fear of the unknown to scare our viewers. Often the violence is only suggested, but what is happening is very clear. Bela Lugosi also costars in THE BODY SNATCHER. It's a dark film where even supposedly good people have other motives. A seriously creepy scene occurs when the doctor transfers a body in his carriage. Simple idea with seriously creepy and unnerving overtones.",3.0
"I had heard a lot about this piece, it was worth seeing.  Comparing it to Wide Sargasso Sea--I would have to prefer the latter.

While lacking in the satirical soul of some of Brooks' previous entries (""Blazing Saddles"", ""Silent Movie""), this film revels in the quick witted verbal sparring and cartoonish slapstick gags Brooks is also known for (""Young Frankenstein"", ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"").

Leslie Nielson plays the title role with the straight wit of his Frank Drebon character from the ""Police Squad"" and ""The Naked Gun"" series, injected with the bombastic flair required of a character who wears lavish capes and turns into bats. It is a treat to see Nielson stretch out a little from the purely comedic roles that established his contemporary career, and play a character with equal parts charm and menace. Those who only know his work from ""The Naked Gun"" are sorely missing out on the wide range of performances Nielson has given in films like ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""The Poseiden Adventure"".
Likewise, most who watch this movie will not recognize Peter MacNicol as the bumbling thrall, Thomas Renfield. MacNicol is the slapstick backbone of this film, with his character at the epicenter of most of its physical gags. MacNicol's exaggerated performance is such a far cry from his roles in ""Chicago Hope"" and ""Ally McBeal"", that you will swear it's not the same man. Other notable performances include Amy Yasbeck as the melodramatic damsel in distress (Mina Seward), Steven Weber as the stereotypically affected romantic lead (Jonathan harker), and Harvey Korman as the pretentious and stuffy Englishman (Dr. Seward). Mel Brooks drives the action of the movie by playing Abraham Van Helsing as the cunning foil to Nielson's Dracula.

Most of the performances by the supporting cast send-up the stuffy, pretentious culture of Victorian Enlgand, but since the original Dracula (and much of Gothic Romanticism in general) already satirized that point in history, it feels overblown to the point of melodrama.  However this isn't such a bad thing, since most of Mel Brooks' films are goofy by nature.  If you can surrender yourself to a film that is more absurd that most of others by Brooks, you may find yourself with a new Halloween favorite. At the very least, it's better than ""Ernest Scared Stupid.""",3.0

"Mel Brooks took on the legend of the literary and cinematic character of Dracula with this spoof. Leslie Nielsen is decent but not great as Dracula mainly because he is simply too old to play Dracula. Mel brooks and harvey Korman are the best of the supporting actors because they underplay their roles and are able to come off with some funny moments. Overall, the film pushes the envelope a bit but it still manages to entertain the viewer. Watch this along with Young Frankenstein and it will be an enjoyable double feature.",3.0
"It is more like the original series than some movies, though the monsters are a little more intense. The woodsman is a scary looking maniac that swings an axe at anyone in range, similar to the slasher movies of the eighties. The fishman is fast-moving version of the creature from the black lagoon. And the final, and most brief, monster is the flying banshee/spectre that appears for one chase scene. It scared my kids more than any other scooby doo and started to worry if this was too intense for my 5 year old. At least the ending doesn't involve any real monsters or ghosts.

I thought the creators focused a little too much attention on the girls' very brief swimsuits by panning across their bodies while the girls stood in a pin-up pose and the guys ogled them. But I guess I'm the only one that thought that was out-of-place in a children's cartoon. Still, Daphne seems to have traded her fashion sense and adopted Daisy Duke's wardrobe. I guess hey want to keep the dads watching too.

The graphics are very nice, you can see some 3D modeling mixed nicely with the hand drawn characters. The back story is kind of interesting, though I think it could have been better woven into the story if they didn't spend so much time being chased by 3 different monsters. Overall, a solid addition to the series, but they've traded spooky and innocent fun for something a little scarier and slightly sexier.",3.0

The movie is a parody of Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 Dracula film.  This helps explain the big white wig Leslie Nielsen wears in the film.  The gags are good and the jokes fly in and out at a good pace.  It is not up to the standard of Young Frankenstein but better than Men In Tights.  The supporting actors are fine.  The cinematography and sets are not up to the standard set in Young Frankenstein.  This gives the film more of a TV movie of the week feel rather than a big screen production.,3.0
"It is mildly amusing, with a couple of laugh-out-loud moments.  I always appreciate Mel Brooks humor, but it can be erratic.

Leslie Nielsen plays Count Dracula and Mel Brooks plays Professor Van Helsing. I didn't recognize the names of any of the rest of the cast. The plot line sticks surprisingly close to the original book, which is not the usual thing for a satire or a comedy made from a serious book. Of course, much detail is dispensed with, as it always is in converting a book to a movie.

Still, there are some very funny parts. And there are parts which are clever, if not exactly funny in the usual Mel Brooks way. For example, to prove that Dracula is a vampire, Van Helsing and Dr. Seward set up a fancy ball to which they invite the count. When he starts to dance with Mina, Dr. Seward's daughter, they uncover a huge mirror and observe that while Mina shows in the mirror, Dracula does not. Dracula is caught up in the dance, and does not notice the mirror. He lifts Mina over his head, spins her around, and generally does a great many things she couldn't possibly do on her own. Yet of course in the mirror she is dancing alone, even when high in the air. It was fun, but the segment went on too long, well after we all got the point.

Several elements seem to have no other purpose but to be ridiculous, which I suppose is consistent with Mel Brooks' style. One is the huge pompadour wig Dracula wears, and seems to treat it like a hat to take off whenever he chooses. Indeed, the second time he does this, he refers to it as his hat. Also he and Van Helsing talk in some ancient language, and act like schoolboys in insisting on having the last word. But since these words are never translated, it seems to have very little point indeed.

I suppose there is enough here to recommend it, especially if you get a bargain.",3.0

"Before I go into detail, I'd like to say that I was expecting utter hilarity from the combination of Mel Brooks and Leslie Nielsen.  They were both comedic heavyweights in their time, but their time was obviously before this movie came out.  Good performances, even though Mel Brooks hardly ever breaks out of his ""Jewish guy who makes fun of his own heritage"" act.  By the end, the only person I fondly remember was Amy Yasbeck, whose happy-but-clueless act somehow never gets old.  I realized how little this movie made me laugh when I saw Vampires Suck not long after, and actually laughed harder at that one.  Leslie has been funnier.  Mel has been funnier.  Just not this time.",3.0
"It was pretty good, it was fun. I don't think it did anything special for me in particular, but I think there could have been a case made to run with the main character for sequels.

"I was really looking forward to this movie from all the stellar reviews I was reading.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed after viewing it for the first time.

I can't really recommend or not recommend this movie.  It's one of those movies that are just for certain people.",3.0
"Overall, I like this film, and it has its moments that are pretty funny, but it seems to lag at times and the attempted humor seems forced instead of having a natural comedic flow.  I'm a Leslie Nielsen fan, so for me, it's worth watching it just for that.  The character of ""Renfield"", Dracula's right-hand man is also done very well.",3.0
"The ideas here are very clever. But this turns out to be more of a ""tell the audience what's going on"" movie than show them. People talk about what they're going to do, what they've done, what they're doing. There's a lot of talk and little action. For some kinds of movies, that's fine. But for this kind of movie it just doesn't seem to quite work. Of course you can consider this to be a very offbeat detective story, which is what it is, true. But the characters are just not involving enough to counterbalance the offbeat quality of the movie.

We don't really get a fully humanized portrait of Daryl Zero, the title character. As for his assistant, Steve Arlo, we know he's getting tired of working with Zero, but that seems to be the main trait that comes across characterizing him, which doesn't do much to flesh him out either. As for the ""bad guy"", Ryan O'Neal, he's bland. Zero's love interest, played by Kim Dickens, is the most fully realized character in the movie but when you bounce that characterization against someone who we don't have a fully developed character for, it just doesn't feel like there's a legit reason for the two of them to hook up.

I gave this three stars because the ideas are sharp. I wish I could say it was a movie that pulled me in, but it really left me pretty cold.",3.0
"THE first film from Jake Kasdan, the son of famed director Lawrence Kasdan (Pacific Heights, The Big Chill), is a detective comedy that works off a premise so obvious it's surprising it hasn't been exploited more often.

Zero Effect steals the Sherlock Holmes mystery formula and places it into a contemporary context. The problem with Kasdan's film is that it doesn't get much beyond this modestly clever idea. Mixing excessive plot intricacies and broad, quirky comedy, the film ends up as a mildly puzzling sophomoric diversion.

The self-styled ""world's greatest detective"" is Daryl Zero, played by Bill Pullman (Independence Day). He's a twitchy character, hair askew, eyes glazed and living in Howard Hughes-like isolation. As is often the case, Pullman seems to be in an acting class of his own, experiencing complicated inner surges and thoughts that don't have much to do with his character.

This is hardly the ""cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind"" of Arthur Conan Doyle's detective, though the parallels are deliberate. Instead of cocaine, Zero imbibes amphetamines; instead of playing the violin, he plays loud, squawky confessional songs on his acoustic guitar. But armed with the latest in information-gathering technology and arcane knowledge -- bylaws governing motel bed placement for the past 30 years -- Zero solves cases with magical precision. The Watson of the story, Steve Arlo, is played robotically by Ben Stiller (Flirting with Disaster). He's a resentful sidekick who gets drunk and complains incessantly about his employer while trying desperately to have an ordinary romantic life after office hours. He works as a front man for Zero, maintaining strict client confidentiality, and collecting big fees.

At the beginning of the film, Arlo is in a meeting with lumber tycoon Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal), a client of Zero's who is searching for missing keys to a safety deposit box, but who is also being blackmailed for a secret he will not reveal. In short order, Zero has figured out who is doing the blackmailing: a paramedic (a tough gamine played by Kim Dickens, who makes a strong impression here as she does in Great Expectations) who works at Stark's health club. In his quest to expose her motives, Zero gradually finds himself falling in love for the first time in his life, a fallibility that never afflicted Sherlock Holmes.

The movie then changes directions to concentrate on the love story, while Arlo continues his quest to break free of his boss so he can enjoy a fling of his own. The plot is complicated, relying on Zero's weird knowledge and observational skills. But the momentum is gone long before the movie ends and one is left only with a faint sense of curiosity. Like listening to Frank Sinatra sing Stevie Wonder, it's interesting, but why bother? Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.",3.0
"Zero Effect (Jake Kasdan, 1998)

I saw this movie a few days ago, and have been mulling it over in my head ever since. I'm still trying to figure out if I liked it or not. I think so, but can't be sure.

Darryl Zero (While You Were Sleeping's Bill Pullman) is a private detective. Except he's a very odd private detective. He never meets with clients, always talking to them through his intermediary Steve Arlo (Keeping the Faith's Ben Stiller). He is quite capable of doing his job, and doing it well, but when he's off the clock, he turns into a neurotic wreck (did you ever see Creepshow? Think E. G. Marshall, but the sloppy version). Zero accepts a case from Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal), a wealthy chap who's being blackmailed. He won't say what he's being blackmailed about, of course. The farther into the case Zero gets, the odder things become, and on top of it all he finds himself extremely attracted to Gloria Sullivan (Thank You for Smoking's Kim Dickens), a paramedic he meets in the course of investigation.

Kasdan's feature film debut is a fun little flick, at least. Pullman is surprisingly good in the role, a definite change from the calm, tightly-wound types he normally plays. This is also one of those rare films where Ben Stiller shows that he can, in fact, act. Dickens also turns in an above-average performance, but everyone else involved seems rather dull; even O'Neal seems to be doing a (rather passable) attempt at a William Shatner impersonation. Amusing for what it is, but is loses its lustre when carried on for an entire film. Angela Featherstone, playing Arlo's girlfriend, seems thrown into the film solely for eye candy (the subplot that develops because her character exists could have been done in a number of ways), and the majority of the minor characters seem to be there for window dressing more than anything else. Also, the pace could have used a bit of tightening.

Still, not a bad movie by any means; it's just a first film, with many of the hallmarks of a first film. ** ",3.0
"Increasingly, watching Mel Brooks' movies is like watching an old man engage in onanistic activity.  The genius was starting to feel canned as early as HIGH ANXIETY.  That said, there are enough good moments to make this worth watching, most of which involve Peter MacNicol's nice tribute to the original Renfield (Dwight Frye).

If I were Mel's career advisor, I'd tell him to try something totally new.  How about making a really scary movie?  I bet he could do pretty well once he got used to the idea.",3.0
"Yes, it's quirky and offbeat.  The characterizations are well-done (I really enjoyed Stiller's portrayal of the ""sidekick"").
But the plot itself is a bit contrived; plot developments tend to appear out of thin air, rather than as a result of the actions of the protagonists, and some of them feel clumsy.
The pacing is irregular, dragging through characterizations then spurting forward with developments, and then repeating the cycle (which, admittedly, isn't necessarily a detraction from a movie, but I noticed it and didn't like it in this one).
All in all, it was a pleasant enough diversion, especially if you like the lead actors, but ultimately forgettable.",3.0
"I like private eye movies but Zero Effect just took too long to get started and Daryll Zero himself (although brilliantly played by Bill Pullman) knows so many stupid things that no one would ever remember for any reason. Check out the scene in the crime scene motel for example.
Ben Stiller is quite watchable too though. But for some reason in every scene with him and his girlfriend they are making out. I don't know if anyone else has noticed this. Tho he's actually got a decent character to get his teeth into this time instead of the 'hapless boyfriend' role he always seems to get stuck with.
""Zero Effect""s main problem is that's it's too talky and almost every scene takes place indoors. This adds an unwanted sense of claustrophobia to the film.
Writer/Director Jake Kasdan does have talent and I would like to see him go far in Hollywood. And perhaps even make a sequel to ""Zero Effect"" but with a bigger budget and a more accessable plotline. It would be a shame to kill of a potentially great franchise because of one rather lame movie.

"I enjoyed this movie despite the fact that I won't give it more than three stars. Bill Pullman and Ben Stiller both give great performances in this movie; this may be Pullman's finest vehicle to date. However, the movie ultimately fails to live up to the potential of a decent enough screenplay because of the directing. I got the feeling that Kasdan didn't entirely trust the actors nor the audience to ""fill in the blanks"" so rather than letting Zero's quirky character stand on its own, various characters have to say throughout the movie, essentially, ""Zero is quirky,"" over and over again.
There are too many poignant pauses that embarrassingly just hang there, not contributing to character development. Other scenes drag on providing detail that simply doesn't contribute to the overall enjoyment of the movie. I got the feeling that the director was aiming for a ""Buckaroo Banzai"" sort of cult following with audiences dissecting, for example, each line of Zero's love song sung standing on the bed in long underwear and boots.
So if you just want to take the movie lightly and enjoy it, it has too much detail randomly applied. If you want to ""cult out"" on the movie, the detail seems spurious and not integrated.
Surround sound mix was, at the very kindest, uninspired. Other than a few special effects (gun shots) there was a noticeable flatness to the sound stage. A perfect example is when Zero and the girl are out shooting at night: there is a lot of ambient outdoor noise (frogs, crickets, et cetera) but it is all coming out of the front center speaker. It is so easy to expand that out to the corners of the sound stage and thus augment the feeling of being outside at night...",3.0
"first of all, i give this movie 3 stars, simply because it's mel brooks...to me, he is truly one of the comic greats...with that having been said, let me say that, mel brooks should never have less than 5 stars, considering the brilliance of films like ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Silent Movie"" and ""High Anxiety"" (one of my all-time favorites)...anything less than 5 stars clearly indicates that something is wrong, and, while i can't understand the admiration in other reviews towards ""Robin Hood:Men In Tights"", it certainly explains their more 'complimentary approach' to this film...as far as the comedy goes in this film, it's below par at best, with some fine performances by harvey korman and peter macnichol, bringing medicore material to a higher level...and that's what this film needed...higher level...steven weber and amy yasbeck are fine in their roles, but, when it comes to the lead, leslie neilsen just isn't funny...yes, he used to be brilliant in ""police squad"" and ""airplane"", but that's when he wasn't trying to be funny...once he discovered his new 'comedic' career, he stopped 'being' funny, and started 'trying' to be funny, mugging and blatantly over-selling every gag...and this truly ruined the film for me...had another actor taken over the lead, all as it was, it may have been a far better film...as for the title, it was just brilliant of brooks to take his classsic ""...and loving it"" line from ""Get Smart""...but, there too, they even knew that 'control' beats 'kaos' every single time...",3.0
"This spoof of the Dracula films is certainly not the best of Mel Brooks' parodies, but in spite of the predictability and often corny attributes of this movie, I found myself laughing and enjoying the really good parts and forgiving the bombs.  We all know the story, so it's up to the cast and crew to make it seem fresh.  Leslie Nielsen is surprisingly low key in the role of the mysterious Count, but he's nonetheless effective.  Peter MacNicol plays the looney bugeating Renfield and with his zany voice and those wacky eyebrows, he's a real hoot.  Lysette Anthony outshines Amy Yasbeck in the doomed female role, with her lusty sexuality compared to Yasbeck's more prim and proper lass.  Writer/director Mel Brooks is subdued as Van Helsing, but he still has that old cinematic charm.  The talented Harvey Korman does well in his role as Yasbeck's veddy proper English doctor, and Steven Weber's stuffy Jonathan Harker is quite good.  Brooks' late wife Anne Bancroft has a hilarious cameo as the village gypsy with the warbling voice.

Some of the best gags involved Dracula's naughty shadow and the staking of Miss Lucy.

Not a classic, but enjoyable.",3.0
"While not nearly as clever, parodic, or satirical as his cinematic masterpiece YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974), Mel Brooks' 1995 entry DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is nonetheless a humorous spoof of the classic Dracula films that horror fans will likely regard as a worthy companion piece to the comedy director's magnum opus.

The structure of the tight, well-written script for DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT primarily borrows from that of the classic Universal flick of 1931 that made Bela Lugosi a star, but it also takes lots of playful jabs at Francis Ford Coppola's grandiose 1992 interpretation of Bram Stoker's classic novel and manages a poke or two at the Hammer Studios flicks, starring Christopher Lee as the eponymous count, that were popular in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Fans of the horror genre or vampire sub-genre are likely to enjoy this film more than a general audience, as it requires that esoteric inside knowledge to ""get"" many of the film's funniest jokes.

The casting of deadpan comedic actor Leslie Nielsen as Dracula is a master-stroke, as Nielson's interpretation of a clueless count generates numerous laughs totally independent of the script's laugh lines, yet his performance also greatly enhances the scripted jokes.  Also delightfully wonderful is Peter MacNichol's portrayal of the insect-ingesting Renfield.  MacNichol does a seemingly dead-on (excuse the pun) impersonation of Dwight Frye's manic performance in the classic 1931 film, yet he also manages to adeptly parody Frye at the same time.  It's a performance that has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  Director Brooks himself delivers a few good belly laughs in the role of vampire hunter Van Helsing, Steven Weber (of TV's WINGS) is stupendously stoic in the role of Jonathan Harker, and Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony round out the talented cast with their own combination of humor and sexiness.

Overall, the laughs in DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT are more sophomoric and visceral-based than YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.  But even if Brooks' more cerebrally satirical sense of humor is missing here, there are still lots of laughs and the director's genuine affection for the classic horror flicks still shows.

The DVD from Warner Home Video offers a mostly pristine anamorphic widescreen transfer of the flick, and the cool extras include the original theatrical trailer and a feature commentary with Brooks, actors Weber and Yasbeck, and the writers who helped Brooks script the film.  (Actually, this commentary is much more informative and entertaining than the dull, stoic commentary that Brooks recorded solo for Fox's DVD treatment of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.)

Note: This is a four-star flick for hardcore genre fans, but a general audience probably won't understand the basis for all of the jokes and puns.  Thus, the three-star rating given by this reviewer takes the general public into consideration.",3.0

"3 1/2 stars --  NOTE: The first paragraph comments generally on the first two of the ""cavalry trilogy,"" and it is identical with the corresponding paragraph in my review of ""Fort Apache.""  For comment on ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" specifically, you can start at paragraph 2.

I have just viewed the first two of John Ford's ""cavalry trilogy,"" which were very successful in their time (1948-50) and, judging by the amazon ratings are still very popular today. It's not really clear why that should be -- and I write as one who has watched them with pleasure. It must be the case that their original popularity had something to do with the state of the US immediately following World War 2, but I don't know exactly how that is to be understood. Part of it might be the image of the US Army, which is not presented as perfect but which is idealized in a more subtle way, perhaps, as suggesting that (a) for all its flaws, and for all that bad judgements can be found among its officers [like Henry Fonda in ""Fort Apache""], it represents an idea of discipline, order, and sacrifice, which is what we want to believe about those who commit violence on our behalf; and (b) it contextualizes these values with the unique aesthetic and cultural values associated with the landscape of American West, epitomized in Ford's movies by Monument Valley, which suggests at once an idea of humility (people are small in relation to an impressive ""American"" Nature) and a pride in values of endurance and courage associated with Western expansion. These suggestions are pure speculation on my part, and they don't help answer the question of why the movies retain their popularity. From a 21st Century viewpoint, there are all sorts of things ""wrong"" -- there's the crude stereotyping of the Irish, for example, and John Ford, who had directed Victor McGlaglen in ""The Informer"" a decade earlier, surely knew better. Then the young women are embarrassingly stereotyped coquettes -- I'm thinking of Shirley Temple and Joanne Dru -- who are completely lacking in any moral or psychological interest or plausibility. This is not the fault of the actresses. The older women characters are usually practical and sensible. There isn't a black face to be seen in either ""Fort Apache"" or ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" though both are set after the Civil War -- ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is set specifically in 1876, the year of Little Big Horn. As if to make up for that, the Native American are represented as worthy of respect. The cavalrymen know their tribes -- they are not just an undigested and threatening ""other."" And in both ""Fort Apache"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" they are shown as respecting those who give them respect -- in both of these movies, that's John Wayne. At the same time, one has to admit that these representations of mutual respect occlude a century of shameful treatment of Native Americans by the American government, and, at the local level, by many of the westward-bound white settlers whose endurance and courage we like to think about. So, it's a comfortable vision -- it still has the power to make us feel good about ourselves and perhaps to discourage any hard thinking.

So -- what about ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon""?  I think ""Fort Apache"" is a better movie.  It has something closer to a dramatic conflict at its heart, in the relationship between Wayne's and Fonda's characters, AND it doesn't shy away from violence.  This one does, and that's partly because the comic element in the movie -- the love rivalry between the two young officers Pennell and Cohill (Harry Carey Jr. and John Agar) for the attention of Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru) -- gets mixed up with the serious plot concerning the threat of Indian uprising following Sitting Bull's defeat of Custer at Little Big Horn, which the cavalry officers at Fort Starke learn about right at the movie's beginning.  The mix-up comes about as a result of a decision to send the women (including Miss Dandridge) back east to remove them from the threat by Indians.  A reconnaissance column is tasked to getting them to the railroad, but the women's presence slows the columns's progress and leaves it vulnerable to attack.  Captain Nathan Brittles (John Wayne) leads the column -- he's just days from retirement and this is seen as a last mission -- and he ends up having to get the women back to the fort when Indians stall the party.  There are some odd features, though.  Brittles has had dealings with the old Indian Chief Pony That Walks, and he visits the Indian camp, under a flag of truce, to see what can be worked out to avoid bloodshed.  The Chief welcomes Brittles -- lots of mutual respect, obviously -- but then says that he's helpless: it's these darn kids!  The young bloods want to fight and won't listen to the older, wiser ones (whom we see in one telling shot, looking grim).  So . . . is there any way to avoid bloodshed?  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that its an ending more consonant with sentiment than with realism and that allows the viewer to keep some sympathy for the Indians and, once again, as I said earlier, celebrate the discipline and courage of the army.  It makes the movie more of a romance than anything else, especially when one considers the fraughtness of Indian-American relations in the 1870s.  It was more than a matter of unruly young braves, and the movie soft-pedals the reality of a very bad situation.

But there is one more thing that works in Ford's favor as we respond to the movie: it's shot in color and it looks great.  The Indians especially are just enchantingly filmed, and the costuming is gorgeous.  So are scenes of the Indian camp and the Monument Valley setting -- the enhanced spectacle is always arresting to the eye, and it helps offset one's irritation at the cliched lameness of the ""romantic"" plot, in which Dru is hardly credible as a coquette and the young officers seem too immature to be officers.  And a nod to John Wayne -- made up to look about twenty years older than his age at the time, he gives an engaging and credible performance of humane and wise widowed army ""lifer.""  You'll like how it ends for him.",3.0

"Typical 1940s cowboys and Indians style movie. It takes place in the south-west in 1876 against a backdrop of the recent defeat of Custer and the claim of Indian insurrection under the alleged direction of Sitting Bull. Captain Brittles (John Wayne) must lead a column through hostile Indian country but is forced to return to the Fort in defeat on the eve of his retirement from the Army. He is retained as a scout and he undermines the Indian resistance by driving their pony herd away while they're in camp and thus they are forced to return to the reservation. I was a little uncomfortable with the black and white good guys versus bad guys plot. Also, of slight annoyance to me were the numerous errors with the uniforms. I understand the tan hats didn't come into use until the 1880s. May of the men were wearing the kepi hats in the Civil War style with the insignia on top of hat instead of the 1872 style crossed sabers on the front. Enlisted men were wearing officer's hat cords on the slouch hats. As well, I think the salutes were still the palms out in those days instead of the hand flattened as it is nowadays.
A fun movie to be taken with a grain of salt.",3.0

"This package gives you the American Experience version of the presidencies of Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan.  Each covers the most salient parts of their early biographies and then shows how their careers led them into politics and eventually the nation's highest office.  About what you would expect from PBS in terms of placing each in the overall context of American history.  A good place to start and get more information or ideas about each of these presidents, but not definitive by any means.  Hardly one-sided, there's a healthy amount of criticism for each of these Republican presidents.
The Eisenhower one does a good job of showing what Ike was like before he became either a famous general or a politician.  The parts about his wartime exploits are more personal than reflective of the war in Europe of which he was such an integral component.  The approach toward his presidency is a little simplistic and follows the interpretation that Ike led by a ""hidden hand.""
The Nixon part of course focuses heavily on Watergate.  There was more to his presidency, but this is given relatively short shrift.  Basically portrays Nixon's political insecurity and obsession that someone was always out to get him.
The Reagan part actually has separate reviews on Amazon, but it draws heavily on the commentary of Edmund Morris, who would not have been my first choice.  Potential bias of the narration aside, the video of Reagan and interviews with his staffers and colleagues is very good and worth watching.",3.0
Part 4 is an ok horror movie that has the biggest body count of all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. The kids that survived Part 3 are back in school with a new pack of kids that Freddy will tear apart. They don't  last. Freddy easily kills the first two dream warriors and is set to kill  Kristen when Kristen gives her powers to kill Freddy to a new Nightmare  heroine Alice. Freddy is more of a comedian then ever. In my opinion he  cracked one two many one-liners in this film and not enough time trying to  be scary. That is my biggest complaint of this film. It doesn't try to be  scary. It just tries to show us another Freddy film with no real reason to  do so. Alot of the deaths that Freddy commits in this film are quite  original and some are just plain gross(like the cockroach girl). Robert  England and Lisa Wilcox are great as the villain and hero. This film also  has the most gory Freddy kill. You will actually see the soles that Freddy  keeps inside him rip out of the clawed killer.,3.0
"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is just about on the level of 2 and 3 (mediocrity), which basically is a mediocre movie with surprisingly few scares. Yes, Freddy is in top form here, but that's the only real highlight. I'm not a big fan of excessive special effects in horror movies, either. In some ways, this feels like a sci-fi movie. If you're going to make a horror film, keep the lasers to a minimum! Also, this movie gives John Carpenter's The Thing a run for its money when it comes to the gore. And if you like 80's music (I do for the most part), this movie provides plenty, along with the 'big hair.' Overall, this fourth installment doesn't resonate when it comes to being dark or suspenseful. The three stars I'm giving it are generous.",3.0
"This is the first Freddy movie I saw back in the day.  I know, Some of the acting is not the best but, this is my third favorite behind 1 and 3.

"watched a nightmare on elm street part 4: the dream master for the first time in years. now, this is a movie i saw a trillion times when it was released; i guess that's how long it took me to see it for the piece of junk that it is. but it's fun junk, and i really enjoy alice and her struggles. once again, we get a tightly knit group of teens who circle up and attempt to withstand another (contrived) krueger assault. i can't believe that they still trot out the old ""elm street children"" thing. let freddy just kill for the sake of killing. i certainly don't need a reason. the kids are really likeable, a motley crew made from all of the school's social castes, as well as entertaining holdovers from part 3, kincaid and joey. it's a bummer that patricia arquette didn't return as kristen (i can't imagine why), but tuesday knight gives it her best shot, and she does just fine.

dream master has some great visual effects, and, honestly, it seems that the movie is filled with them, wall to wall. the make-ups are excellent, and mention must be made of kevin yaghers excellent work, as well as steve johnson, and screaming mad george. there are some great gags, not the least of which is brooke thiess' (heather langenkamp's sister on just the ten of us) kafka-esque metamorphosis. freddy is as far from dark here as possible, delivering one liner after one liner, and only occasionally mustering a bit of menace. but robert is having fun, and he is in total command of the character. the dialogue throughout this film is utterly terrible, and is often distracting. but the music is good, the kills nifty, and a sense of good fun permeates everything in this terrible, entertaining flick.

"A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET IV: THE DREAM MASTER pertains to Kristen(Tuesday Knight), Joey(Rodney Eastman), and Kincaid(Ken Sagoes)get released from the Westin Hills Asylum & are now living normal lives & attending high school.  While Kristen has managed to make new friends: A bright daydreaming girl  Alice Johnson(Lisa Wilcox), a brainy, quiet asthmatic girl Sheila Kopecky(Toy Newkirk), a tomboyish who despises bugs Debbie Stevens(Brook Theiss).

A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 was also the highest grossing flick of the week when it was released in the Summer of 1988 and this sequel ranked #1 during its theatrical release on Friday August 19,1988 along with the fact that A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET IV was also the highest grossing horror flick of 1988 which was also the year when HALOWEEN IV:THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS and FRIDAY THE 13TH:PART 7-THE NEW BLOOD were released too which made 1988 a great year for terror flick releases.

As a matter of fact; HALLOWEEN 4 did very well at the box office during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1988 and FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART VII didn't do to shabby at the box office either during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1988.

It's also almost as if this 4th sequel also inspired the release of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET V:THE DREAM CHILD & FRIDAY THE 13TH: PART 8-JASON TAKES MANHATTAN in the Summer of 1989 and HALLOWEEN V: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS in the Fall of 1989.

Additionally; A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 was Robert Englund(Freddy Krueger)was his personal favorite installment of the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET flick saga & this 4th installment was also considered one of the fans favorite sequel of the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise too.

In fact, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET IV had a great story, funny Freddy lines, not too gruesome & a cast that worked very well together & even Wes Craven(Director of the original A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET)gave this flick positive feedback as well.",3.0
"The year it was made it was top notch horror , to watch it yrs later great way to see how the film industry and technology has improved.",3.0
"The first Nightmare On Elm Street film was an excellent horror flick and is a classic or the genre, it introduced Freddy Krueger as one of the most memorable villains and its concept of a child killer killing teenagers in the dreams was an interesting concept and one that worked well at that, it stood the test of time. When a movie is successful there's often the temptation of trying to reproduce that success with a sequel and sometimes it just doesn't work. Case in point: Freddy's Revenge which was a poor sequel and even messed with the original a little and was just an embarrassment. Dream Warriors was intended to be the third and last Nightmare film, the goal was to end as a high note and lay the character to rest. It's probably the best sequel and added backstory to the original along with returning cast and goes back to what made the first film so great. When Dream Warriors was well received and a success came the opportunity to make another sequel and being that horror films are cheap to make and can generate big revenues, a fourth Nightmare flick was made. Dream Master is bit like taking a step back after the step forward that was Dream Warriors. It's entertaining and enjoyable however, it continues on the third film's story and does so reasonably well and doesn't end up a total flunker like the second film, it was even the biggest of the series at the box office. To its credit Dream Master is entertaining and has some of the most creative/entertaining kills of the series and the idea for the script was actually not a bad one.

Three of the teenagers from Dream Warriors are still alive and Freddy is after them. One of the survivors, Kristen, who was introduced in the previous film has nightmares about Freddy again and she starts pulling people into her dream and as usually happens Freddy goes after the teenagers one by one. Kristen could summon people into her dreams, that was her gift but soon enough Freddy gets to the survivors and eliminates them one by one. For the franchise to continue there needs to be new victims, before dying Kristen passes on her powers to Alice, and it's her and her friends who become tormented by Krueger who can continue to exist once more. I thought that whole idea made sense and was rather good as far as horror logic and continuation goes.

One thing that's noticeable immediately is that Kristen who we first met in Part 3: Dream Warriors is back although Patricia Arquette is no longer playing the role which was given to Tuesday Knight. That was a bit misleading but for continuation purposes it made sense to bring back the character of Kristen who was seen as the new Nancy. I think Arquette made a better Kristen but Knight is not horrible and has a certain appeal to her. They even brought back two other characters from the previous film. The way Krueger is killed is in this one left a little something to be desired, it wasn't awful and probably not the worst way he died in the series but it wasn't totally convincing is how I would put it. After the original Nightmare its sequels introduced more comedy elements and give more of the funny one-liners to Freddy which worked well to a certain degree. Other than some interesting kills, Dream Master is content being almost near comedy territory; it's as if not trying to be as scary anymore and this would only increase with the next sequels.

Dream Warriors tied things nicely and was a fitting ending; it went back to origins and had purpose which was ending Freddy and the nightmares for good. Dream Master doesn't work as well because it continues the story but doesn't reveal that much more, it's just an entertaining slasher flick that keeps the party going a little longer (not that there's anything wrong with that). It's certainly not a bad Nightmare and is one of the better and more watchable sequels, other than the fact that an actress who played one of the key characters has been replaced, the story and the film itself are actually good. I feel it's from here that the sequels became less intense and inspired, it almost serves as a link between the first three films and the ones that followed (except the 2010 remake and 1994's Wes Craven's New Nightmare which is really more of a stand alone film and not a continuation). It's a less scary, thrilling nightmare, a bit lighter and more comedy thrown in. It's not a letdown and its actually one of the best sequels only this time around things are a little too lose and predictable. A product of its time of course that ends up being a good 80's slasher flick. 3  stars",3.0
"This movie, while not as good as A Nightmare on Elm Street or Dream Warriors, was still a pretty good movie. It is a direct follow-up of Dream Warriors, featuring the surviving characters from Dream Warriors at the same time as Nightmare III left off. This movie is darker than the previous film, where Freddy seemed to take on a more comedic side. It was a different change, and a delight to watch, but it's nice to have Freddy go a little darker in this movie. Although the humour is still there (and this is just my opinion) it's not as strong as in Dream Warriors, which makes it an all right movie.
I do, however, have a few problems with watching this movie. As a Christian person (with a love for horror... odd mix!) I find this movie very religiously blatant. The famous children's prayer ""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep..."" is used in this movie when the children go o sleep, but it is blasphemiously changed, so the characters say this: ""Now I lay me down to sleep, the master of dreams, my soul I'll keep...""
Apart from that, it's a great movie, great casting, great acting (Robert Englund, duh!) and great storyline. I particularly love how this film continues where A Nightmare III left off, unlike, for example, Nightmare II in which Jessie was never seen again.
However, it is disappointing that *ELM STREET III SPOILER* Heather Langencamp's character Nancy Thompson was killed off at the end of Dream Warriors. It was truly sad to see him go.
This movie is more entertaining than the first and second films, but not as good as Nightmare III. This is the second best of the films (so far, I'm writing reviews for all the Nightmare films, and of the ones I've done, this is second best).",3.0
"Freddy is back in this forth film to kill teenagers again.

The pros

Englund really brings it as Freddy once again. His performance as Freddy is great as in all the films. I really liked the story line and plot as well. I'd say this is one of the better written films. Better than part 2,5 or 6. Has some of the most imaginative kills in the entire franchise. I liked most of the actors who did a great job. The surviving actors from part 3 return as well. This film has some of the better music of the films. At least two songs play that fit it very well. I also really liked the character of Alice. She's my favorite next to Nancy. I felt that Alice is one of the most developed characters in the film series. The vhs version has a small interview with the director. Not long,but it did shed some insight into what he was trying to do.

The cons. Some of what I say could be thought of as spoilers. Here is your warning.

This film is really toned down compared to the three that came before it. It doesn't even try to be a horror film. The director has even said in interview that he wasn't trying to make it scary. They kill off the surviving characters in the first part of the film. It would have been cool to let them live. I hated how Freddy dies at the end. Has to be one of the weakest ways he gets killed in any of the films. Couldn't they have though of something better. This film is were the series really jumped the shark. 3 had Freddy being more goofy than the others,but this film takes it to a new level. Also the blood and gore is toned down greatly from the first film. The actor playing Christen is not the same. I guess they couldn't get the same actor back. It doesn't kill the film,but takes away from it a bit.

My conclusion. Good film and one of the best in the series. Fun to watch and enjoy. However those looking for a horror film or the Freddy from the first film will be unhappy. If you can get past that then you will enjoy this film.",3.0
"To me part 1-5,(with 1 of course being the very best),2 being good,and 5 downright silly.represents the height of the freddy franchise.

"I am reviewing the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series, but not this DVD release. I own the box set and I wanted to do individual reviews for each film.

By now the ""Nightmare"" franchise is replacing scares for laughs, but it does deliver some good FX moments. Robert Englund has played the character so many times he can do it in his sleep! The DVD transfer is very good on this entry and the disc has some cool goodies to check out.",3.0
"This installment of ANOES is where I start having trouble enjoying myself. While The Dream Master does continue the story of part 3, it seems to be rather uneventful and linear.

When most of the characters in ANOES 3 were dispatched, the addition of Alice and her brother were cool, but Alice's character was still in her meek stage in this installment.

Overall The Dream Master works as a transition film, it's not the climax, but it works up to it. While there are some cool dream and death sequences (personal favorite is the roach girl), ANOES 4 really leads to nowhere...but it guess it kinda makes sense because there's a 5th part.",3.0
"This is a very disappointing entry, and could be the worst out of them all. There is no blood in this movie except for in the water in one scene. The only redeeming thing about this movie is two scenes that were great-the roach motel scene and Freddy's death scene. Besides that, it was rather dull and not good. So it's average, those two scenes are great, but does it justify the rest of the movie? That's your call",3.0
"Freddy [Robert Englund, Doing what he does best] is revived by flaming dog urine and after killing all of the survivors from the original film, It's up to Alice [Lisa Wilcox] to put a stop to Freddy's new reign of terror before he kills everyone on elm street. This is an ok sequel. Freddy is fun to watch in action as always and there is a pretty good story here, But i was dissapointed in the lack of quality acting in this one [Which is a shame because part 3 had the greatest cast of all the nightmare movies]. This makes for a good weekend movie to watch. Does feature a couple of memorable murder scenes. Fans of the series should be able to endure this one.",3.0
"its a fairly good movie, I liked that all the Elm Street kids finally died because now he can move on, and it makes sense but they couldve got some better actors because the actors they got were horrible, and Tuesday Knight looked nothing like Patricia Arquete, and her acting was an embarassment to all the Kruger movies and she couldn't even scream right",3.0
"This was the first of the horrible NOES sequels. First of all, Patricia Arquette did not return to reprise her role as Kristin. Second, Freddy was supposed to be scary??

"Average and overrated, the two words that describe this movie. I'm not just saying this because I kind of bashed Freddy in my other review, but I don't see how this made the most money at the box office. Sure, there are some sequences that were funny, but most of the movie was tired and predictable.
The story picks up from the last Nightmare movie, with the heroine Kristen and her friends. As usual, Freddy gets resurructed (in a very weird way, even though it was in a dream) and finishes them off quite nicely. Then Kristen bites the dust because her mom slipped sleeping pills in her drink, but not before she drags Alice into her dream and gives her the power to pull people into her dreams. One by one, Alice's friends die at Freddy's hands (?) because she mistakingly pulls them into her dreams. Then comes the predictable ending. Big whoop.
The acting was average at best, except for Robert Englund, who does a pretty good job with the jokes and the methods of killing and etc. But the movie definitely lacked the horror from Nightmare 1, 2, and 3. It was more like stand-up comedy than a horror movie. I'm not even going to go into how the body doubles looked. (koff;horrible;koff)",3.0
This movie had some great moments and special effects but it lacked the dark flavor of the previous sequels. This is the real beginning of the comic freddy krueger and some of the characters I didn't really care for. I cant say that the movie was bad but I cant really say that the movie was great. Some people may really like this movie but I prefer the previous sequels to this one. PEACE OUT.,3.0
"After the surprisingly good Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, New Line once again resurrected Freddy Kruger to wreak bloody havoc.  The Dream Master finds our three survivors from Dream Warriors all getting picked off by a newly revived Freddy; and introduces us to Alice who now has Kristen's powers and poses a threat to Freddy.  Director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) upped Part 3's ante with even more elaborate, gorey, and macabre set pieces and deaths; some of which are the best in the series.  However, this is where Freddy stopped being scary and became the one liner spewing fiend that he is known (and loved) for; but either way Robert Englund is still a joy to watch as everyone's favorite razor clawed killer.  Dream Master also lacks the character development and coherent (well, more or less) storytelling that most of the other installments contained, but on it's own this is a pretty solid horror flick.",3.0

"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master is the first of the Nightmare movies to use a lot of special effects. The first 3 stuck with prosthetics and animatronics, and Nightmare 4 went with special effects. Some of it was corny (The meatball heads), and some of it was outstanding (The roach girl).
 The story begins with Kristen (Who is now played by Tuesday Knight) and the two other surviving ""Dream Warriors"" Joey and Kincaid. She explains how she thinks Freddy is coming back. Joey and Kincaid tell her to forget it, he's dead. Welp, he's later risen by Kincaid's dog urinating fire on his grave in a dream, and Freddy succeeds in killing Kincaid. Freddy then offs Joey, and subsequently Kristin. This is what I didn't like about Nightmare 4. They are easily killed by Freddy in this one when they were strong enough to survive in earlier. It confused me, but I guess it was crucial to the storyline. In between their demises, we're introduced to a whole new group of kids. None of them are Elm Street kids, but Freddy decides he wants more souls so he used Kristin to pull one of her friends into the Freddy's dream world so he can continue his soul getting. The fried Kristin pulls in is Alice. Alice has a special talent that she doesn't know about. She's able to accept her friend's real talents and instincts when they are killed by Freddie. The final battle between Alice and Freddy is one of the best final confrontations out of all of the Nightmare movies. (Excluding New Nightmare.)
 The acting by Tuesday Knight was, in the least, horrible. I wish Patricia could've come back. The others faired well,and you cared for some of them. Lisa Wilcox, the gal who played Alice, really shined. She made Alice my favorite Nightmare heroine. Robert Englud returns as Freddy, but Freddy returns as a wise-cracking bumbling idiot. There's no more mystery or darkness to the character anymore. That was a downfall.
 In conclusion, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master took a couple of steps down from NOES3, but the ending made up for the whole movie.",3.0
"Renny Harlin is a great director of thrillers. He's done movies like the second ""Die Hard,"" ""Cliffhanger,"" and ""Deep Blue Sea,"" all of which I liked. I like this one, too, even though this is about as close to camp horror the series had gotten. Freddy is as cool as ever, but as I knew he would eventually be, he is now a character instead of an idea, and he has enough wise-cracks to give Andrew Dice Clay an entire show to work with. I know that I'm criticizing more than I'm praising, but let me just say that this is one of the most stylish entries in the series. Renny Harlin has an incredible talent for showing us something new, even with the contrivances in the script. There are many memorable sequences in this film, and it also introduces Freddy's most formidable adversary: The indomitable Alice. Lisa Wilcox is Alice, and she does a good job. Her character is the only one that really develops during the movie, but that's okay, because we know in our gut, right from the very beginning, that she's the one who will face off with him at the end. And with the trick camerawork and awesome visuals, it is quite a fight. Renny Harlin deserves a heck of a lot of credit. His style overcame the substance in this movie. As I always believed about movies: It's not what you do, but how you do it. Good job, Renny. Without you, this one would've been the end.",3.0
"the first one was the best of the series since it was completely original and from horror master wes craven superbly done, mad props go to wes for that; the second one was pretty gay- if you've seen it U know what i'm  talking about; the third one was worlds better than part 2 but couldn't  reach the caliber of the original...nonetheless it was a very good and  entertaining film written/produced by wes craven again. while it seemed  that part 3 could've properly concluded what could've been a great trilogy  (execpt part 2 didn't really fit in with 1&3). but no, they HAD to go  back and resurrect freddy. renny harlin directed this one and made it  pretty o.k. with the special effects and all, but under all that was just a  weak story. what they could've done was allow at least one of the remaining  characters from part 3 live to see the end credits of this one but they  deicded to give us an entirely new protagonist with the same villain back  and up to the same old tricks again. because part 3 was so good, part 4 was  the most financially successful installment. the concepts of horrible  nightmares and pulling someone else into a dream were about worn out by  now. the reason i even gave it 3 stars are for two reasons, one being the  special effects that were well done and the other the fact that renny  harlin directed this. renny's films are pretty good (die hard 2,  cliffhanger, deep blue sea). the soundtrack on this one, if you have it on  dvd, is also wonderful in 5.1 dolby dogital, otherwise you get stuck with a  mono soundtrack. i would've maybe given it 4 stars but that was prevented  because of freddy's chest which was about the scariest thing of the movie.  it all goes downhill after this with part 5 and freddy's dead being the  absolute worst of the series. they're so bad that wes himself has to come  back and do the last one so that the series can go out with some dignity.  bottom line: watch parts 1-3 and if you think it should end there its fine  where it is after 3, then don't get this one but if you want more freddy  after 3 then go on ahead but don't place expectations too high. just get  the whole series on dvd for the best bet.",3.0

"A very mediocre movie.  An ordinary story told in an ordinary way.  If you've seen a movie about drug kingpins, you've already seen this one.

In particular, Depp's character never takes the ""downward spiral"" we expect from people who do drugs all their lives.  Yes some rubber makeup makes his face look older, but his personality never seems to change... just his luck gets worse.

Although ""based on a true story,"" I didn't fine the story very believable.  Depp (""George"") could move incredible quantities of drugs to just one person.  There must be a hell of a story as to how THAT person distributed the nation's cocaine, but that story isn't in this movie.

"There are plenty of comments re: the merits of the movie itself, so this review is just about the sound on the blu-ray edition.  It is at least a full second out of sync with the video, making it seem almost like a cheap kung fu movie that has been dubbed in English.  And no, this isn't a problem with my equipment (PS3), which has successfully played over 100 other blu-rays without audio sync problems.",3.0
"This starts off really well, with a guy who kind of stumbles into drug dealing and then applies his great natural talents to it with innovative audacity.  For the first half of the film, it portrays the whole hippy-to-coke era as a a kind of almost innocent frolic.  Then, once some real baddies emerge, it get really rough in the second half, leading to the downfall of a more or less good natured guy who wants to get out and raise his daughter, but cannot.  In other words, this is pretty cheaply romantic, almost making George into a feckless victim of the more ruthless players he is forced to deal with, to ever worsening betrayals.  That is what hollywood did to the story of a criminal who helped bring Escobar's cocaine into the US at horrendous cost to the society.

That being said, the film is fun to watch.  You get a feel for the 60s-80s, music, fashion, and all.  For the first hour or so, the acting is also extremely good, particularly with Depp as the young George, and tightly edited.  Once the downward slide begins, however, the film's tone becomes rushed and sloppy.  That makes the second hour boring in addition to dreary and depressing.  OK, it does become a kind of morality tale, but it is rather heavy-handed to say the least.  Finally, it is not an interesting portrayal of the drug industry.

I would recommend renting this, as you may not want to watch it over and over.",3.0

This movie was just okay.  I thought it would have been much better.  Decent.,3.0
"THe acting on this movie is great.  But as with any biography
the truth often gets far behind.  A large number of people around the REAL
coke dealer met unfortunate ends probably at the dope dealers orders or his accomplishes.  You can't be in the hard drug dealing world without
deadly violence.
But we don't see any of this. In fact a early character is said just to vanish.  Yes. well most likely jung had him killed.  When the late coke addict director of this movie ( he died overdosing on coke) wanted to tell Jungs story he presented a much kinder version of reality than existed.  A true bloody tale would have been more accurate and entertaining but director instead tells us a version of drug dealing that is like a fairy tale in some ways.  That's nothing new for hollywood.
Many biographies are so whitewashed that the real person would be amazed that this person on screen is supposed to be him!.  The reality though is that coke and it's children have laid waste to millions of lives and to make a movie that doesn't show this destruction is rather strange. But then the director was a coke addict.  he's dead and long after the real jung is dead the damage he did to the world will be with us. still the movie is entertaining because it has good sctors in it. The blu ray looks great too.",3.0
"not one of Jhonny Depps beast movies it was okay kinda sad that he couldn't stop dealing drugs, to be with his family. well all in all it was an okay film.",3.0
"What I liked about 'Blow' was the intersection of protagonist George Jung's life with kingpins like Pablo Escobar.  These events help put into perspective the dangerous game that Jung was playing.  The introduction of Escobar into the tale (and what an intro) is meant to show the Johnny Depp's character has crossed a threshold from lifetyle choice into serious nacrotrafficking.

What's strange about 'Blow' is some of the casting choices.  The late Ted Demme obviously liked to go against the grain.  I can respect that.  The Johnny Depp of 2000 was known for his risky role-taking, so having him carry the lead isn't a problem (and, as a native Bostonian, I think he put on a fairly credible Massachusetts accent...certainly light-years better than Laura Linney's savage botch job in 'Mystic River'). And, Jordi Moll&agrave; is outstanding as he is everything he does.

But Kiwi Cliff Curtis (of subsequent 'Whale Rider' fame) as Escobar?  Maori...Antioquian...what's the difference.  What an odd choice.

Likewise, getting me to buy off on Ray Liotta as Depp's father (eight years in age difference between the two) was a stretch.  Liotta looked 45 throughout the film (his age at the time), regardless of the amount he spent in the make-up trailer.

And, 'Blow' was another in a string of movies from that period (along with 'Woman on Top,' 'All the Pretty Horses' and 'Vanilla Sky') designed in part to force-feed Penelope Cruz down the throats of the American public and make her a bankable Hollywood star.  And, that was not - nor is it ever - happening.",3.0
"Looking at the cover, I expected to see a bit more of Penelope Cruz; however, her role, although pivotal, was minor compared to Johnny Depp.  Johnny Depp shows how the life and times of the convicted drug dealer George Jung aged and changed him.
The typical movie about drug lords and dealers tend to be stark and violent.  Even though this movie has its share of violence, the movie humanizes Jung to show depth and feeling.  We see his motivations and concerns.  Although we don't condone the behavior, we have a better insight into why this happens.
The DVD has some interview footage with Jung to provide the viewer with some background information.  I found this interesting, but Jung is not very animated, which can be expected from the long time spent in prison.
I would recommend this movie.",3.0
"This movie went straight to video here, and although has an interesting storyline, the film jumps too quickly between periods to really pull you in.  Johnny Depp was excellent, as was Rachel Griffith.  Johnny Depp plays a real life cocaine dealer who eventually gets what he deserves.
A movie that overall is quite boring to watch.  Rent it.",3.0
"Chronicling the life and crimes of George Jung, Blow sizzles with style, but substance (not substances, theres plenty of those here) is another story.  Thanks to Johnny Depp's superb performance as Jung, we feel sorry for Jung who rose to power in the marijuana and cocaine trades through the years only to lose it all to one police bust after another and after another.  If it were any other actor in the role, I doubt any sympathy would have been felt at all for Jung.  The rest of the cast includes Penelope Cruz as Jung's wife, Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Ruben, Ethan Suplee, Cliff Curtis, and Ray Liotta as Jung's sympathetic, loving father.  Cruz is just plain annoying most of the time, while Liotta is his usual great self in his role.  All in all, Blow is worth a look, but a film which displays the dangers and consequences of addictions has been done better in films like Requiem For a Dream and Traffic.",3.0
"Beneath its cool, cool surface, blow is an old fashioned morality play about the importance of hard work and family. The right virtues are exemplified by Johnny Depp's father. While Depp achieves great success, it is all based on a lie and eventually his world comes crumbling down and he loses it all. Loosely based on an autobiography, the film never discards its moralistic edge. Indeed you begin to scream at the characters not to be so stupid. But drugs and big money can take their toll. You would think after the first ten million dollars most people would just stop, but the characters lurch onto their destruction.
I did feel some sympathy for the central character but then I realised that he helped make the Colombian cocaine kings rich and remembered the devastation that they caused in that country. I think he got off pretty lightly. At least his daughter is still alive.",3.0
"This, I felt, was a good movie but it was hard to retract from the fact that George Jung was personally responsible for selling drugs in the US which is now responsible for millions of addictions and thousands of deaths.
Having said all that, this was a great film to watch though it did surprise me somewhat. Basically, this movie is about a guy named George Jung who was the first american to smuggle cocaine into the US.
It shows his life story from humble beginnings in dope selling to the high rolling stakes of cocaine smuggling. As to the reason why this filmed surprised me ? It is because I wasn't interested in the fact that cocaine had dealt the US with a major drug problem, rather the plight of George Jung himself ( and his parents ) and what he was like.
At best, this movie portrayed George Jung as a humble kid who turned into a drug lord ( in which he deserved what he got ). Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and the two Aussie actors Cliff Curtis and Rachel Griffiths played their characters well enough for all of us to believe that George Jung was only trying to earn a living at what he did best: selling drugs.
Look, I did like the movie and the characters but am a tad suspicious as to how an audience is to react to a movie like this ? At the end of the day I do have to admit that this was a very good movie. Overall, Ill give it a 3.5/5",3.0
"The folks that put this together did a nice job.  They captured an era and a lifestyle very well while telling their story.  They signed a terrific lead actor, and a great supporting cast that reminded me dead-on of several people I knew in college.  Very watchable, and a good biography.
What keeps it from a higher rating is partially the bad luck of it being released around the time of the far superior ""Traffic"".  But besides telling you that one man was more responsible than others for the explosion of cocaine in this country 25 years ago, there's not much else.  While the movie certainly doesn't portray George Jung as a hero, it is asking for sympathy when things important to him are finally taken away.
However, here is a person who did NOTHING but deal drugs for a living all his adult life.  Now I can buy the arguement that he was just supplying what the people wanted, and the purchasers are just as guilty as the supplier.  But there are two problems I have with this.  First, the movie goes to great pains to show that he wasn't necessarily a violent man, although he did carry a gun and threatened people with it.  But his close association with Pablo Escobar, who was a merciless killer, puts Jung big time in guilt by association.  For this I have no sympathy for the man.
Second, this guy did his second swing in prison because he was under surveillance for his first pinch.  He knew very well the cops were watching him, yet practically sets himself up for the bust.  With all that, and knowing that the government was REALLY observing him after his second visit to prison, what does he do?  Goes out and becomes part of another big deal. Like Henry Hill in ""Goodfellas"", it never occurs to him that there are other ways to get money, albeit not as quickly.  I think society sometimes has to lock up stupid people to protect them from themselves.
Overall, I did like the movie, and recommend it.  But for someone who has lived totally for himself all his life, and in his forties all of a sudden has a child, this doesn't make you a nice person.  Yes, prison is bad when it takes away the things you like, but then that's the point.",3.0
"This is a review of the DVD, not the film itself--which has its own set of problems in this fascinating true story delivered in a very inconsistent, flawed fashion. But I digress...on to the DVD. ""A"" for concept, ""D"" for execution. It's hard to believe that anyone actually reviewed and checked the results before this went into production.
Both Video and audio are quite good--a very clean, impressive job that truly makes watching this film enjoyable and worthwhile.
It's on the Infinifilm extras where this DVD comes up extremely weak. Though a few are terrific additions--the interview/comments with the real George Jung, for example--others appear to be slap-dash efforts at filling up the disk and giving the impression that there's real quality within. A good example is the so-called ""Fact Track,"" which is designed to play as subtitles in the Infinifilm version of the movie. ""Fact Track?"" Hah! Loads of typos/spelling errors (heroine instead of heroin in one passage, for example), factual errors (Woodstock Festival--""Three Days of Peace and Music"" as it occurred in 1969--has an extra fourth day added here by the creators of the ""Fact Track""), random ""Facts"" that come in places that often demonstrate little rhyme or reason for their location in the film and hop all over the map without any real sense of organization, bio subtitles about some of the cast but not others, a blatantly unbalanced anti War on Drugs message which is rendered so via tons of stats on (what I agree is) the huge waste of federal monies and effort in this regard WITHOUT ANY mention or statistics on the still ongoing devastation wreaked upon our country by cocaine and, by his involvement, George Jung.
The Documentary on the effects of cocaine on Colombia is pretty good and important given the lack of mention in the film itself, but at times the people speaking (in Spanish with English subtitles) talk so rapidly that in some spots it's nearly impossible to both follow the dialogue and the picture without watching again. (Maybe that's the trick! ""You'll watch it over and over again!"")
The Production Diary--short video excerpts on various random days of the 63-day shoot--includes an excerpt from one day which consists entirely of an audio track that is normal like the rest but accompanied by video which consists entirely of the camera pointed down at the pavement. Intriguing.
Last but not least, the Infinifilm feature itself--think VH1's ""Pop-up Videos""--is fabulous in concept but a failure too often in execution to really be worthwhile. Some extras (most deleted or alternate scenes, for example) appear exactly where logical, such as the alternate Intro. Others pop up in places that seem to be entirely random (Ted Demme's filmography, which pops up not with the opening credits, but instead somewhere deep within the film.) Some just don't fit where they are at all in a fashion that leaves one believing that the creators weren't even paying attention (or perhaps had just done some BLOW) when they inserted them (a jump to a spot about Otisville FCI pops up early in the film when George is sent to Danbury FCI instead of at the end when we see him in the Upstate New York slammer.)
The most useful and enjoyable part of Infinfilm (an overall concept which has the potential to be phenomenal!) is the ability to see alternate versions of scenes in direct A/B comparison to the ones that made the final cut.
Look, I don't HATE this DVD package and did enjoy the film and exploring the disk, but its features are WAY OVER-HYPED and fall short of the sell-job done on them. Unabashed fans of the film will probably love them all regardless of the ""Facts."" Do other Infinifilms have similar problems? This is the first Infifinifilm I've seen.
One note about the film and its screenplay. Both contain an error early in the film (in the mid 1960's) when George, Tuna, and his other bud from Mass. are discussing the colleges back in Mass. where they can sell their weed. One school that they mention is Hampshire College, which didn't enroll its first class until 1970. FACT CHECKING, FACT CHECKING. Can't believe no one in production caught that, given the comparatively large number of Hampshire grads who work in the film industry. OK, OK, I'm done....",3.0

"I'm impressed with Infinifilm's presentation style in their DVD efforts.  I really loved 13 Days (see a prior review), and if there is one thing worthy of notice in ""Blow"", it is the presentation, technical style and DVD extras.  No attempt is made in the actual film to explore the horrors of cocaine, but the two
documentaries make it clear how the 70's drug of choice has devastated the culture and society of Colombia, along with the lives of many.  Ted Demme, a fine director, explores what scenes were left on the cutting room floor in an entertaining piece, and the real George Jung gives a film interview that makes the ""goings on"" in Blow seem a little closer to reality.
That said, the film was a disappointment to me - well filmed, with no seeming point or passion.  I felt that Johnny Depp was
believable and totally in character for the role, and perhaps he
and Demme meant to have him exhibit little or no passion or chemistry with the central women in his life, his mother, his wife, his daughter.  He's believable in the youth scenes and the drug trafficking scenes, in prison....but seeing him try to make us believe that his daughter is the central focus of his life...well, it just didn't feel that way on the screen.
Ray Liotta is miscast and subdued as Jungs' dad, and, with every passing flick I grow more and more disenchanted with Penelope Cruz, who just seems to show up on the screen, emote a little, and hurry to get back to her film trailer.  Capt. Corelli was disastrous, she is strident and unattractive in Blow, and, intuition tells me that Vanilla Sky will fall on its face.
So, you take a bit of pop culture, add an incredibly talented leading man and director with little support from the other cast, and perhaps not enough of a tale to tell, and you get ""Blow"".
Not a favorite of mine.",3.0
"Johnny Depp continues his tradition of not selling out completely to the mainstream and making movies that are, at the least, intriguing. BLOW is a good movie, technically very well-crafted, not overlong, not indulgent. Of course I don't care the least about JUng's final destiny, I hope he rottens in jail. Penelope Cruz is the only weak actor performance here. All in all, a good movie without purpose.",3.0
"This film presses all the right buttons, but being touted as basically the true-life story of George Jung, I was disappointed that the film paid little respect to the chronology of significant events and completely overlooked many of the defining moments of George's career.
Having already read the book ""Blow"" - available from Amazon and an excellent biography - perhaps I found it more difficult to get ""into"" the movie, often asking myself ""why is this happening/not happening now?"" amongst other things...
A few obvious changes for dramatic effect, perhaps.....
1. George's first girlfriend (played by the babelicious Franka Potente) tell's George she has an incurable disease, so he skips bail to hang out with her in Mexico until she dies. In actual fact, the girlfriend was dumped pretty quickly, was never fatally-ill (interviewed for the book) and was one of a long, long succession of girls that George used and discarded during his ""career"". He skipped to Mexico purely because he didn't want to go to jail, and move into ""quantity"" smuggling of marijuana.
2. George is basically kidnapped and taken to Colombia to meet Pablo Escobar, - a test - and this meeting ""starts"" the whole coke business. In fact however, George had been importing/dealing large quantities of coke for a few years before going to meet Pablo - something he did voluntarily on his own, to gain status among the Florida-based Columbians and gain favour with Pablo in his problems with Carlos Lehder - a cartel member.
The movie ignores or trivialises many of George's character traits - huge long-term coke usage and the resultant psychosis and paranoia, his life-long addiction to hookers, kinky sex, including masochistic tendencies played-out by cross-dressing (french maid)and being dominated and ""spanked"" by his wife while tied spread-eagled to their marital bed, among many others.
The turning point, the start of his ""real"" troubles is when George confides his secrets to an undercover cop whom he meets one afternoon on the beach out-front of his house. In short-order, George invites the guy into his house, tells the cop that he's a big-time smuggler and immediately makes him part of the ""operation"" without knowing anything about the guy. This of course brings big heat onto George, and the good-guys start engineering George's downfall.
The movie omits this entire pivotal event however, perhaps because the real-life event, that for a genuine big-time dealer with $30m stashed in the house,at least, displayed a degree of stupidity and naievety that would make Johnny Depp's George (smart, hip, trusting)look stupid and just too unbelievable to be sympathetic.
Nor is there any factual basis for the whole father/daughter interplay in the movie, which I personally think is overdone, and is pretty out-of-character anyway.
Finally (at least for this review) the money George had stashed away in Panama, approx. $50m apparently, was not confiscated by the Panamanian Govt (Noriega)- George never visited Panama - but was stolen by the pilots who opened the bank account for George, (co-signatories) and flew the cash down on a regular basis over several years. It defies belief that over several years, George never thought to enquire about the balance of his account, and just kept shuttling the cash into the account, but that's what actually happened.
Carlos Lehder was arrested in Colombia - basically fingered by Escobar for bringing the heat down on the cartel because of his loopy political beliefs, extradited to the States, with George being the main prosecution witness. This gained George early release, and it was actually another bust in the mid-80's that reulted in George's present incarceration. Again, none of this was in the movie, although I think it would have brought another perspective to George's characterisation, and also given George some revenge for his beating by Carlos' thugs on Norman Cay (never happened) had it been included.
I guess all these and many more factual inaccuracies in combination with Johnny Depp's overly sympathetic portrayal of George - almost a victim of circumstance - and definitely too ""nice"" to be in the drug business, are so far off the real-deal that it made it very difficult for me to give this movie the respect that so many others think it deserves....
All this doesn't stop the movie being good entertainment but I can't help thinking how good it ""could"" have been, had it been a little more true to George's real story.
The cast is generally outstanding, the look and sound of the DVD transfer never less than luscious, and the soundtrack really brought back the  70s / early 80s for me - a time of bad fashion, worse haircuts, and for most of us, a time probably best forgotten.
Buy the DVD. The book ""blow"" is definitely worth reading, and if you're still interested in the whole coke thing, consider checking out the book titled ""Killing Pablo"" a factual look at the the coke business, the Medelin cartel, and the hunt-for and eventual killing of Pablo Escobar. Now ""there's"" a movie just begging to be made......",3.0
"Movie Summary: George Jung moves to California and discovers drugs. He is an ambitious young man and soon takes to selling pot. He quickly builds a large marijuana business and gets rich. This operation gets broken up when George gets busted and sent to prison. He goes to prison with a bachelors degree in pot and leaves with a PHD in cocaine. Once out of prison George hooks up with his former cell mate and starts building an immense cocaine empire.
My Opinion: The music in Blow is awesome. It is what stood out the most for me. It adds depth and excitement to the film. I was tapping my foot more than once while watching the movie. The story was engaging while I was watching it, but didn't stay with me after I was done watching it. It fails to make a stand on what it is saying. It shows George's life and leaves the viewer to make any decision. It leans towards showing him as a good guy who just keeps screwing up. I got the feeling that he saw his only mistakes as getting caught. Johnny Depp is excellent as the main character. He is very cool and likable. I have a feeling he makes George look way better than he actually was. I found Penlope Cruz and her character to be very annoying. Her character was suppose to be a reflection of George's mom, but I still found her lacking. Paul Reubens is great as the California drug connection/hair dresser. This should help his career a little. The story and direction are very stylish and smooth. The scenes that were removed help fill in the plot, but they would have slowed things down. Overall I found the movie lacked punch. The music made it good while I was watching it, but I quickly forgot it when it was over.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 Excellent video quality. Sound: DD 5.1 Extras: This is an Infinifilm edition. This means that it is packed with extras that are accessible while watching the movie. These extras include: Deleted scenes that help fill out the plot, interview with the real George Yung (man is he ugly!), commentary, documentaries, trailers, character outtakes, and production diary. This is a fully packed DVD release.
What You Should Do: Rent it. It's a decent story to see once but it doesn't have repeatability. The extras make it a really great DVD release, but I can't see wanted to watch the real George Jung more than once!

"Johnny Depp proves once again that he can portray just about anyone in ""Blow,"" a story based on the life of George Jung the first American drug traffiker to bring Cocaine into the USA from Colombia on a major scale. Depp's style of acting is really anti-acting in that he literally becomes the part he is playing much like Marlon Brando, James Dean and Paul Newman who came out of the New York's Actors Studio. His style of acting is very natural, though with little of the seams and krinkles we see in Brando or Dean's performances. Depp also makes daring choices: how different can his chracter in ""Sleepy Hollow"" be from his character in ""Chocolat"" or here in ""Blow?"" Depp is the best thing about ""Blow"" despite director Ted Demme's dreary, lackluster pacing. Penelope Cruz who plays Mirtha, Jung's wife, heretofore has been a whirlwind of talent and sexiness, but in ""Blow"" she is merely drugged out,petulant and mostly boring. Check her out in ""Woman on Top"" or ""Some things about my Mother"" to witness Cruz at her best: earthy, smart and sensual like a young Sophia Loren. Franka Potente as Barbara comes off best after Depp proving that she can also play a kind, warm-hearted chracter very much in love with George. ""Blow"" only succeeds because of Depp and Potente and to a smaller degree Paul Reubens as Derek. It's interesting to note that the real George Jung, who will be released from prison in 2015, had never heard of Depp before this film!",3.0
"I wasn't really familiar with the story of George Jung, but by the end of the movie I realized that he was a very tragic figure.  However, I don't really know if he was tragic enough to make a feature length film about.  The stuff he does is big scale and he even says that if you did cocaine in the late seventies or early eighties he had something to do with it, but for the most part the audience just drifts through this movie because of its fast pace.  You really don't get to know George Jung as a person instead of a big drug dealer.  That is what this movie is lacking, characterization.  There a lot of interesting characters, but they're very one dimensional.  The style of the film keeps it afloat with bright colors, cool camera techniques, and great music.  It's worth a rent and if you like it buy it, but it's not for everyone.",3.0
"Is it Ted Demme's fault that Martin Scorsese came out before him? Of course not! But, we can't help but think back on Scorsese's films, mostly because we've seen what happens in ""Blow"" in movies like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". It's the same old premise with movies like these. Small town kid who grew up poor, decides that he will make it big one day. He later then gets involved with the wrong group of people. He or she finds that they can make quick easy money by either selling drugs, or getting involved in gambling or owning a casino, as long as they have all the angles figured out. Once they get a small taste of this new lifestyle they automatically want more, and there's always someone around who knows how to help them. Later we find that they now have a big house, lots of cars, meet beautiful women, and have more money than they know what to do with. There's actually a scene in this movie where Depp's character and a friend have a apartment room that is full of boxes and this those boxes it's filled with money! Now, once they get to the top, everything must crumble. That's the premise this film takes. We learn about George Jung (Johnny Depp), a poor kid who rew up watching his father work hard all his life, but it was never good enough for his mother. She would constantly leave them, telling his father (Ray Liotta) that they need more money. After seeing the way his father had to struggle George decides that that will not ever happen to him. He soon goes away to the west coast, it's here he first comes into contact with drugs, and it will ultimately change his life, for better and worst! George soons discovers what sort of demand there is on drugs. He starts selling his own stuff which he gets from Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens! Who actually delivers quite an amusing performance). As the film later goes on George is caught for carry over 600 pounds of the stuff with him. When in jail he meets Diego Degado (Jordi Molla) who knows a thing or two about the drug business himself. Once he gets out of prison with the help of Diego, George now is amazing importing 85% of all cocaine that enters the U.S.! To steal a line from Maxwell Smart, would you believe it? 85%! The screenplay by David McKenna, and Nick Cassavetes based on the book by Bruce Poter, which of course is based on the actually life of George Jung is amazing. The writters have managed to display all of Jung's bad sides and still have us at times pulling for him. The first hour of this movie blew me away! I enjoyed it so much. If I could only review the first hour I would give it 4 stars. It's not that the movie is long, but the film takes an unexpected turn. But you can't blame the film for this. If that's what happened in real life to George Jung, what can you do? ""Blow"" is a very interesting story that I think people are going to want to see. It's a well made film that had very good acting by Depp. It's not as entertaining as ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"" but it stands very well on it's own. And that's all that counts. A MUST!",3.0

"Although this didn't do well in the American market, it is the kind of humor that plays well in Great Britain. Four stars that by themselves were huge in the States make an inside joke film about the nobility, and the brash American (Mitchum) who crashes the party. I think it works because they worked well together, and because no one tried to grandstand.
Robert Mitchum was a very versatile actor, playing the villain one minute, and a bumbling Anthony Eden the next. Both Jean Simmons and Deborah Kerr had wide ranges, and Cary Grant, well Cary was Cary. This is a wonderfully crafted, light film I would reccommend.",3.0
I like these stars in a different kind of movie.  This was too silly for Robert Mitchem.  Cary Grant is OK in comedies but I would rather see Robert Mitchem in a more serious movie.,3.0

"who wouldnt love the list of actors in this movie, however I found it ok nothing more nothing less.  Really what man would want a woman that had an affair for a week then invite her lover to come and stay the weekend.",3.0
"""The Grass is Greener"" was made in 1961, and I wanted to see it because both Cary Grant and Robert Mitchum are main characters, along with Deborah Kerr.  Overall the story is much better suited for a play, it is all talk and unrealistic English-mannered banter over a wife's infidelity.  Cary Grant plays a British Earl strapped for cash, so he has tours of his English mansion to pay the rent.  His wife (Deborah Kerr) plays a mushroom picking wife with two children (that we never see).  One day a rich  American tourist millionaire (Robert Mitchum) and decides he loves the Earl's wife and proposes to have an affair with her.  The dialogue is pompous ""stiff upper lip""  as the actors play cold-hearted games with marriages and lives.  The script does not fit Mitchum, nor Grant very well, although they do their best to save the film.  I became bored.  Cary Grant is much funnier in slapstick, like ""Bringing Up Baby"" - and Mitchum is better in Westerns and film noir.  There is also the constant reference to a ""Coo-Coo Bird"" throughout, and I guess that was supposed to be funny.  It just grates on one's nerves every time the bird is mentioned.

Overall it is snobbish, full of talk and a small silly plot of a wife cheating on her husband.",3.0
"THE GOOD:
More than a music doc, this is a relevant, illuminating and moving music film. I knew most of the big north-west bands but I had no idea of the context in which they developed, circumstances and the deeply american nature of the whole thing. Hype! quickly turned into my most replayed doc ever. This film captured a pop-culture explosion from within. As Art Chantry put, ""It's fascinating to be able to see it for yourself""; I was transported to Seattle circa 1988-94. its plot has all the ingredients of a great play: humble beginnings, a great struggle, a moment of ascension, a tragic crash-and-burn, and a bitterly optimistic aftermath.

the bands involved offered amazing insight and were very entertaining to see and hear live. Some of them were low profile, bands that didn't break; some others were de rigueur names offering down-to earth and quirky commentary. I have since acquired albums by FASTBACKS, FLOP and MUDHONEY thanks to this doc.

THE BAD:
no extras. it seems this film went under the radar, judging from the poor digital offering here. The doc is great, this DVD is not. While it's commendable that the publisher digitized and released it, It has absolutely no extra content or bonus material. The yards of unedited footage that must have been left out of this cut makes me froth at the mouth. Take for instance The Year Punk Broke, the bonus features nearly doubled the length of the main film. Hype! deserves this treatment. I give it three stars solely on its digital shortcomings. You might as well watch it on Youtube in the same quality.

Will we ever see a BLURAY release? I doubt it. The quality is there, the cinematography of Hype! is impeccable, it was shot in glorious 16mm. Watch Nirvana's Live at the Paramount in BLURAY and you'd see how incredible Hype! would be in 1080p. But it's probably never going to happen. the 90s was a disaster for future-proofing video. Similarly to the X-Files tv series, Hype! must have been transferred from film rolls to VHS tape for the editing process; BIG MISTAKE. This resulted in miserable and constrained 480i transfers that cannot be restored or improved in any way.

Here's hopping that 2016 sees a properly remastered release of Hype! when it turns 20 years old, with an extended 2 hour director's cut, deleted scenes, and extended interviews. It might not happen but it's sure fun to imagine.",3.0
"I saw this movie many years ago when I was young, and always remember that I enjoyed it, mainly for the beautiful clothes and the beautiful setting, and the quite amusing storyline.  I looked forward to seeing it again, but was a bit disappointed, probably because I am a lot older and it seemed corny and a bit boring.  But it is still reasonably entertaining, and worth watching if you like the actors.",3.0
"Cary Grant and Jean Simmons are pictured on the cover of the DVD, but this is a movie about Robert Mitchum (an American) trying to win the heart of an English gentleman's wife (Deborah Kerr), and his (Grant) reaction to that attempt. Jean Simmons has a very small role in the movie as a friend of the wife.

The plot seems contrived at times, and were it not for such outstanding actors in these roles, the movie would fall flat on its face. However, when you have Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr, and Robert Mitchum in the same movie, it is well worth watching.

I doubt any of us would chose the method that the husband (Grant) chooses to save his marriage, but how many of us live in a house that is so large private tours are shown through it just to pay the taxes.",3.0

Lots of tongue flicking and awkward sword play.

The final battle scene - spoilers? - happens on the roof of Silvercup studios in Queens. A clever way of saving on production costs, I suppose.

"There are those that can dance and those that can whistle. If one can whistle but can't dance, he probably shouldn't be dancing. Neil Diamond is one of the greatest singer/songwriters of the last 50 years. Unfortunately, I think he should stick to signing and writing music.

The songs he wrote for the movie were absolute first rate, especially ""America"". As an actor, however, it seemed as though he was reciting lines far more than he was acting. He certainly did not generate much emotion in the role and it was hard to sympathize with the character. Even more embarrassing, he was acting along side Lawrence Olivier, one of the greatest actors of all time.

I recommend you buy the movie soundtrack. That soundtrack was one of Diamond's best albums. This one of those rare occasions where the soundtrack of a movie is better than the movie.",3.0

"So sorry, but I found this so boring.",3.0
"I hadn't seen this movie for a long time, and I had a generally positive memory of it, but watching it again I couldn't ignore the fact that it isn't very good. It has a very unusual and interesting fantasy premise, which is undoubtedly what made it into a ""cult classic"". But the execution is not very good.

You basically have to completely shut off your brain and not think about it, because so much of it is ridiculous and/or makes no sense. One example: at the start of the movie, McCleod is arrested at a murder scene. He resists arrest, and then punches a cop while being interrogated...and then they let him go. Another: an ex-marine driving around NYC with a car full of machine guns sees two immortals fighting. He fills the bad guy full of holes with an Uzi, then he's impaled by a sword and thrown across the alley with it, slamming into a brick wall. He survives. That kind of stuff happens throughout the movie. They seem to have not even been trying to make it believable.

The acting is not great, and the story is not great. The whole movie is basically exposition, told through repeated flashbacks. The special effects, especially the lightning that goes with ""the quickening"" are bad and low budget, even for the time the movie was made.

On the positive side, there is a lot of very impressive scenery and some interesting visuals and camera work. The fight scenes are good enough. And the whole concept is imaginative enough, and the tone light enough, that you don't end up totally hating it. But I did end up feeling like I wasted my time.",3.0
"Much better picture and audio quality than the U.S. release, with some moderate extras. Still miffed they ditched the music videos by Queen, though.",3.0
"First off I would like everyone to take this review with a grain of salt because I am a huge Highlander fan.  Unlike some on here I started off my Highlander fandom with the TV series to me that will now and forever be the best version of the Highlander mythos, and if you haven't watched the show last time I checked a user on Youtube had uploaded the whole thing so do yourself a favor and watch it, particularly seasons 2-5.  I enjoy element of the films, the first film absolutely nothing can touch it.  Hands down the best of the movies.  The main criticism I have of this Blu Ray is picture and sound really isn't all that superior to the DVD.  I was so excited when I first got this because of the extra scenes and because I would finally be able to see the film in all its Hi Def glory.  But man was I disappointed, the transfer just plain sucks.  Its too bad Highlander isn't more popular so that fans can actually have someone go in and give us a real hi def treatment.  The concept for the franchise is awesome, immortals, sword fighting, flash backs to historical times to other times in said immortals lives which connect to modern day.  The how premises is a mix of fantasy, sci fi, and action adventure.  But unfortunately it really has gotten plagued by the cult treatment, B writing, B production, B acting....",3.0

Also the story itself is kind of weak.

"I'll say right off the bat that Neil Diamond is not much of an actor but he was certainly adequate in this role.  Again, Luci Arnaz lifts what could have been a real TURKEY right out of gobble gobble land and into Pretty Good Land.  She is just so good.  One of the worst things about the film is Lawrence Olivier's portrayal of his father. For one thing, unless Neil is supposed to be 45 in this movie then the father just looks way too old to be his dad. And, he overacts in every scene to the point where it is distracting (disgusting). It must have cost a mint to get him and heaven knows that Diamond had a mint to spend I'm sure but couldn't the director have pulled him in some - a lot. This would have been a much better movie with someone else in the role of his father. The scenes of Neil over reacting to his father disowning him are also overdone but I know they needed something to be a turning point in the story. Couldn't just be him getting more and more successful. I've watched it several times and I always enjoy it except, of course, for Lord Olivier. He just grates on my nerves every time. And, as I said, Luci Arnaz is such a joy to watch. I don't know why she was never a huge star. But, the music is, of course, the star of the movie. It is a really enjoyable movie but could have been a lot better.",3.0

Good action movie from the 90s. I liked it. Harrison Ford was great. The rest of the cast is full of big names and they do a nice job as well in their limited roles. There's not a ton of character development. It's an action movie so that's ok by me.

With the instant video I don't have to spend the money on buying a blu ray and waiting for it to get here. Glad I finally say this movie and I plan to watch about 20 more movies like this one in the near future.,4.0

"I saw this film for the first time in theaters with my aunt and a friend, at the time, bad move!(long story) I'm much more analytical now with movies, most of the time. Harrison Ford does a very good president who has a no-nonsense approach to terrorism, led by a cold and merciless terrorist Gary Oldman. The plot is fairly easy to follow, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, who I'd swear Saw composer Charlie Clouser took some tips from) once again has an excellent musical score. Even though I do enjoy this film, I do have a couple issues with it: first, I know Gary Oldman is the primary villian in this film, and the script makes him very easy to hate, more with actions and facial expressions. However, he isn't the only character I couldn't stand, Dean Stockwell as the Defense Secretary, how pathetic, in this case. Aside from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close, the wife played by Wendy Crewson from Good Son and daughter, some characters don't last long enough to even care about. And in movies like this, you have to know the villian has back-up, unfortunately, that cliche has gotten very old for me, along with the ""kill the witness formula"". All that aside, this also set the stage for two other similiar movies recently released in theaters, both that I watched and overall liked-Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down) This film however, seemed like a blueprint for those films, even though, obviously, the new ones, seemed a lot more intense. In those films, however, at least with White House Down, the media was as bad as the terrorists! When it comes to news reporters and tabloid reporters, whatever celebrities want to dish out at them, including violence, dare I say it? Bravo! Esp. when they are so relentless and don't care who they hurt to get their story, remember Princess Dianna? Don't even get me started!",4.0

"The real reason to watch this film is the chameleonic talents of Gary Oldman.  Special effects are dated, but still worth a watch.",4.0
"Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga ""Air Force One"" ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains. Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in ""Independence Day."") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make ""Air Force One"" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.

Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard ""Air Force One"" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.

The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of ""Das Boot""), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of ""True Romance""), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of ""L.A. Takedown""), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember ""Escape from New York?"") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.

The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, ""Air Force One"" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit ""Executive Decision."" Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller ""Passenger 57"" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both ""Airport 75"" and ""Cliffhanger."" The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" franchise and the Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" movies. Finally, the ""Air Force One"" ending should come as no surprise to any ""Star Trek"" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although ""Air Force One"" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.

Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between ""Air Force One"" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller ""Das Boot""/""The Boat"" (1981). The casting of ""Das Boot"" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of ""Air Force One"" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in ""Das Boot."" Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.

Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his ""Die Hard"" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies ""Patriot Games"" and ""A Clear and Present Danger,"" Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the ""Patriot Games"" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout ""Air Force One"" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in ""The Devil's Own"" (1997).

The real casting coup in ""Air Force One"" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like ""Quantum Leap's"" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, ""Air Force One"" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.",4.0
"Yeah, I'd vote for Harrison Ford for president. President James Marshall, to be exact. He's not only the president, he's a first class hero, as this story makes clear. Brief sketch, so as not to ruin all the surprises: there are dozens.

Air Force One, with the First Lady and First Daughter (age 12) aboard, is highjacked by a group of fanatical communists who want to restore the Soviet Union. Key to their plans is the release of their favorite general from Russian prison. One clue -- just one -- to the whole thing is pretty clear early on in the highjacking: one of the Secret Service agents guarding the president is helping the terrorists.

The leader of the terrorist highjackers is Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) who is clearly insane, and has no qualms about killing in cold blood. Back in the White House Situation Room sits Vice-President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) trying to cope with it all. Her advisers can't agree, the military folks present various pretty drastic alternatives, and the highjackers have said they will execute one hostage every half hour until their General is released from prison and they have confirmation of the fact.

OK, there's your tip of the iceberg. The rest is simply too unpredictable for me to want to spoil anything for you. See this film!",4.0
One of the most memorable scenes for me was when Harrison Ford hid behind one seat but turned the neighboring seat to make it look like he was crouched there instead. So when he jumped out and attacked the hijacker I got a nice jolt. This masculine thriller has good pacing and acting but there were a few amateurish special effects that detracted from its realism.,4.0

"The film is reminiscent of many an airplane, ship, railroad and, probably, even ferry boat, terror-hostage-'noted individual at risk' film; however, making it the President, gives it an extra bit of  pizzazz. Of course, Harrison Ford does his usual professional job, the nasty guys are suitably nasty, the good ones are suitably heroic, and one forgives them their excesses in the name of thriller necessity. Thriller it is, and, a good one. Lovers of the genre, accustomed to forsaking reality for the sake of enjoying a film, will like this one. I liked it. The only thing which marred it for me, occasionally was the lurking thought which would rise to the  surface before I firmly repressed it; what if we really had a President in a crisis who also ignored his oath of office so readily, had no sense of his duty to the country, what if we really had a Vice-President so unwilling to do the hard but necessary things. Never fear, President Harrison Ford will triumph as will V.P. Close. Never fear, the United States does not collapse into anarchy.",4.0

"Director Wolfgang Petersen had previously focused on the life of the President in his film, In the Line of Fire (1993), and he returns to that subject in Air Force One (1997), a big budget, over the edge thriller, that had the cooperation of the US Government, and the personal support of President Bill Clinton.  Although Kevin Costner was originally in mind to play the President, it would be hard to imagine anyone better suited to this role at the time, than Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones).

President James Marshall (Ford) is returning from the Soviet Union, travelling with his staff and family on Air Force One, the President's custom modified 747.  While in flight, terrorists disguised as journalists, take over the plane, led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldham).  Secret service agents rush the President to the escape pod in the lower section of the plane.  The pod is launched, so the terrorists believe that the President has escaped, but he remains hidden aboard.

Back in Washington, Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), is in charge of the negotiations with Korshunov, who is demanding the release of General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a criminal being held in a Soviet prison.  US fighters arrive to escort AF1.  As the Government works to recover the pod, Korshunov begins to execute hostages.  The President communicates with Washington via satellite phone, restating his policy of non-negotiation with terrorists.  This signals Marshall's transition from Commander In Chief, to chief buttkicker.

Finishing as one of the top five grossing films of 1997, AF1 is a classic late 90's mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.  With a huge budget, big stars, special effects, and tons of studio backing, it is Grade A entertainment for the masses, where lovable action hero type, Harrison Ford, dons a superhero cape, and against impossible odds, Marshall saves the day.

For the film's key element, the producers researched the real AF1, as much as they could, but much about the craft remained classified.  Within that pseudo-realistic framework however, reality is seriously mangled, as Marshall travels with relative ease, and the hull is never breached by a bullet.  The terrorists are terribly inefficient, failing to take immediate control of the cockpit, and letting the President escape.  Oldman's Korshunov, is quite the patriot, when threatening women and a child, but isn't much as commander of men.  The cast also includes William H. Macy (Sahara), Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkley, Paul Guilfoyle (CSI) Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap), Liesel Mathews (A Little Princess), and Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot).

Wolfgang Petersen is a storyteller, that understands the effective use of action, and he provides an enthusiastic, and informative commentary.  He marvels at the amazing things that were done in the special effects department, which by today's standards, appear quite dated.  Air Force One is an overdramatic, pretentious, but fun fantasy, with a patriotic streak.  It is too bad that today's real problems can't be dealt with so simply.",4.0
"This is a movie that's nothing more than good, silly fun.  Like any ""Die Hardish"" movie, you just need to relax, enjoy the ride and not think about logic. This is certainly Harrison Ford's last, really watchable movie (don't get me started on ""Crystal Skull""!) and there should've been more scenes with Harrison and the always excellent Gary Oldman.  It's fast paced and never dull. If you enjoy over the top action movies where it seems like no matter how bad the situation is, it gets worse, this is one for your collection.

The good: The picture and sound are clean and spectacular, although the special effects show some rough edges.  The sound of the F-16s (?) flying in circles is a great way to show off your surround sound.

Now the bad: The Blu-Ray version doesn't have any extras except for Director's Commentary (which was on the DVD) and ""Blu-Ray Live.""  A serious disappointment for me!
I subtracted a star for this. Otherwise it'd be a 5-star.

"I should start out by confessing how I've always been partial to Posh Spice Victoria Beckham (<nee> Adams back then).

Like others have said, this film takes its basic premise from ""A Hard Day's Night"", then goes wild. This thing covers a couple of days in the life of the girls and leads up to a monumental concert at the Albert Hall in London. It begins at the end of one concert in one town, at the end of which they board their Union Jack-covered tour bus and move on. Thing is, the bus is more than ten times bigger on the inside than the outside, a tribute to ""Doctor Who"", I gather. That's when the fun really starts.

If you want a serious documentary like one about the Beatles, or the Rolling Stones or the Who, that tries to discuss the more serious influences the Spice Girls have made on our culture, you can fergitabutet, although one of the film's character's is a documentary-maker trying to do just that. Like the Girls themselves, this film is never meant to be taken seriously.  It pokes fun at everything in true British Spike-Mulligan ""Monty Python"" style. It kids VIP parties, publicity photo sessions, girls being girls, ""Charlie's Angels"", haunted house themes, army sergeant-majors, news happenings, and the BBC.  There's a newspaper magnate so tired of the group that he's willing to jump on anything that may cause them to disband. There's George Wendt as a Hollywood producer eager to make some sort of film about the Girls and is full of daffy ideas for it. There's Richard Grant as the Girls' hysterical road manager.  There are cameos by Sir Elton John, Sir Elvis Costello ( interesting the amount of knighthoods handed out to major entertainers during the Tony Blair premiership), Stephan Fry, Hugh Laurie, Bob Hoskins, and Jennifer Saunders (""Absolutely Fabulous""), among others.  And there's Sir Roger Moore as the Girl's All-Highest Manager, kidding his own James Bond image. Though I'd agree with other reviewers that the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" take-off is perhaps a bit much. Is this to show how the appeal of the Spice Girls is truly ""universal""  or something?

The Spice Girls themselves are sporting enough to put themselves through any sort of gag. They always kid themselves and each other and preach ""Gil Powah,"" while Posh herself already shows her interest in clothes. And of course they sing their greatest hits, which aren't too bad, though the lyrics being subtitled means you could risk having those syrupy-sweet songs being stuck in your head for some time.

The Spice Girls' fad seems to be over now, but it looked like they had a great time while they were around. And ""Spice World"", while certainly not nearly as great a film as ""A Hard Day's Night,"" tells it all.",4.0

"Back in the summer of 1997 there was a hit movie called Air Force One, with Harrison Ford&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clear-and-Present-Danger-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00008K76V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clear and Present Danger (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;as the President who formulated a plan to stop a terrorist dictator in Kazakhstan.  Praised by the Russians, the President declares he will not back down or negotiate with terrorists.

Those words would haunt him.

A group of Russian reporters (a.k.a. the terrorists from Kazakhstan) get on board and with the help of a mole get into a gunfight on Air Force One.

Now I don't know how realistic any of this really is:  bullets flying all over the plane and the plane apparently puncture-proof.  Or people jumping from a plane at 15000 feet without too much fear like they grew up jumping out of planes.

Even so, with its faults, it was exciting entertainment.  Ford did get beat up a bit and as the body count rose and the hostages were getting eliminated, you began to wonder if he would ever prevail.

The movie slowed considerably after the last terrorist got strangled by the President.  Yuk.  The whole ""plane is falling apart"" and ""I'll go instead of you"" got kinda old fast.

From a 9/11 perspective, it's like we saw September 2001 coming -- it was clear in this and other similar terrorist films of the 90s -- life imitates art it seems.

Great popcorn entertainment for sure, if a bit slow and predictable.

"Harrison Ford plays a US President that has traveled to Russia to make a deal with the Russians to fight terrorism, and to seal the fate of a rogue ultranationalist, former Soviet general.  When terrorists supporting that general slip aboard and then take over Airforce One, the president and his family are in danger.

The action is good, and the bravado of Ford as the US president is exciting. I have to admit, however, that the believability of the entire story is pretty sketchy.  There are quite a few holes in the plot, the largest being the lack of an explanation about why a top secret service agent, the one over the President's security detail, would ever help terrorists.

Even so, the drama and action are good.

Those things together make for a good, but not completely outstanding show.

4-stars...that's it...and perhaps a rather weak 4 stars at that.",4.0
"This is a great film, and it will be even better on Blu-Ray. I am excited that this is finally being released on Blu-Ray in the US.

"Of course ""AF1"" has more plot holes than a Jerry Bruckheimer film, but watching this movie back in 1997 was one of the biggest cinema joys in recent years! ""AF1"" is a MUST for all Ford fans, as well as fans of action. Wolf Petersen is one of my favorite directors, he makes this movie 'take off' and really 'fly' with excitement. I also should say, Gary Oldman is probably the greatest working film actor today who has never been nominated for an Oscar, (as far as I know). I'm not saying ""AF1"" is 'Oscar material' but I'd rather watch this than something like ""The Last Emperor"". ""AF1"" may go down in my book as Harrison Ford's last great action role, so what if it's unbelievable? Almost a classic. It has it's flaws but is an otherwise very memorable film.""",4.0
"As action thrillers, go, AIR FORCE ONE has enough of a plot to keep you watching closely as terrorists take over the presidential plane, a sleek beauty of a craft that makes a gleaming set piece for this kind of adventure in the sky. And who is better qualified to take care of things than HARRISON FORD, somewhat less impressive without that hat and familiar stubble as Indiana Jones. (Well, maybe KEVIN COSTNER who was originally slated for the role).

GLENN CLOSE makes a very commanding presence as the Vice President, seemingly never at a loss in moments of distress, and GARY OLDMAN handles his Russian accent and menacing villainy with his usual aplomb. It's just that if you stop long enough to take a breath while all the action is going on, you might see that underneath all the fancy pinnings this is regulation stuff that's been time countless times before--and sometimes with better results.

The cast is impressive with WILLIAM H. MACY and DEAN STOCKWELL on the prez's team and Jerry Goldsmith providing another one of his dependable, if unmemorable, action scores.

And although Wolfgang Petersen does a nifty job of directing, turning the president of the U.S. into an action hero performing stunts that seasoned stuntmen must have been hired for, does stretch credibility a good deal for the climactic moments when airborne peril is at the max for a cliffhanger ending.

Not bad as an action thriller, but just don't expect it to be any more substantial than a sleek new video game.",4.0
"Just as Dr. Strangelove bordered on the impossible (or did it?), this movie follows an implausible track and makes one feel more unsafe by the day. No Peter Sellers black comedy here. Remember also that this film was issued 4 years prior to 9/11. The true irony is that today in 2007, many people,I suspect, would feel safer with Harrison Ford in the Oval Office and having George Bush and Dick Cheney in a mid-air shootout with subversives over the European plain. In any kind of gunfight, take a Texan and a Wyoming man every time.",4.0

"Nowadays, Hollywood just wouldn't have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism, unless it was an easy target that doesn't spit back (aka, America and it's 1st Amendment).  This film harkens back to the day when people wished our country's foreign policy was a bit more leathery.  Well...ya got it now!  At the very least, a film like this would piss off the surrender-monkeys in the jackass party, not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism, but for the villification and slaughter of Stalinistic, Castro-like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with.  Makes one wonder if the lefty Glenn Close now hates herself for acting in such a film.  What would they say to a film like this?  Unfortunately, there's plenty of room for criticism in this movie, aside from the political implications therein.  Some (arguably, if not all) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey (hence the 4 stars instead of the five).  I think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything, it would have to be the 90's style CGI, especially the plane crash.  At best, one might go so far as to say it was ""cute.""  And what can a guy like me say to that?  Even as I write this review, scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism, in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al Qaida in Iraq, al-Zarqawi, caught himself a couple of 500 lb. bombs with the use of his house.  For those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized (not a far stretch from ""fear-mongering,"" right?) in the fight against terrorism, this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate America.  What's worse, they can't seem to ban a film exalting American nationalism such as ""Air Force One"" from those who wish to see it (oh no!).  And just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about ""The Passion.""  Sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every American and not just the idealistic ""intellectual"" few, doesn't it?",4.0

"When Air Force One, carrying President James Marshall and his family, is taken over by terrorists, the President makes it to the escape pod on the plane, but he refuses to leave while his family is still on board. With all members of the Secret Service dead and the terrorists threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour until a prisoner is released from a Russian jail, it is up to Marshall to stop the terrorists. Will he be able to stop the terrorists and save his family?

Okay, in this type of film viewers know from the beginning that the good guys are going to win and the bad guys are going to lose, badly, but not before lots of people die. But, while somewhat predictable, and highly implausible, this is still a good thriller, with plenty of edge of your seat chills. There's just enough twist on the action adventure formula to keep the viewer from guessing what will happen next.

Director Wolfgang Petersen deserves most of the credit for making this film work as well as it does. There are plenty of thrilling action sequences, especially the one that closes out the movie. Harrison Ford is a bit stiff as the President at the beginning of the film, but loosens up and does fine once he gets into action hero mode. Gary Oldman is wonderfully creepy as the main terrorist. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell do fine as the Vice President and Defense Secretary. William H. Macy is, as always, perfect in a supporting role. Wendy Crewson is also good as the First Lady.

This is a good action adventure film.",4.0
"This movie is a good, solid movie but it's really unrealistic. Like the president could have really taken down a large group of terrorists. I mean he's not Arnold or a military expert. He's the president for God's sake! Like any president could have done this! The movie's simply about the air force one plane that's hijacked by Russian terrorists and the president decides to stay on board and not go in the ejector seat and kick their buts! Which he of course does! Gary Oldman, Glenn Close and Harrison Ford star in this good but completely unrealistic movie.

Can you see Bill Clinton or George Bush beating up terrorists like Harrison Ford did? Maybe he should be our president, lol.",4.0
"Disclaimer: I am an 80s-born female, who blossomed into her wily teen years through the 90s. While I rebelled (musically) against most of the pop-in-a-box boy- and girl-bands, commercial disney bubblegum, sinfully unoriginal one-hit wonders of the pop world, somehow I got swept up in the tornado that was the Spice Girls. I remember sitting on my bedroom floor, making specially crafted mix tapes which included the likes of Rob Zombie, Incubus, Limp Bizkit, Korn, Papa Roach, etc. And there, on my CD rack, sat not one, but TWO Spice Girls CDs. Single-minded listeners be damned! Sometimes, living in popular society (shopping at Walmart, listening to any major FM radio station, participating in social media, going to the movies) carries with it the burden of being exposed to things, experiences and or people that wouldn't normally lie in one's range of taste. But there you are, unable to avoid it. And then, sometimes, what first may repulse can suddenly attract (insert adage about opposites, Paula Abdul song, yada yada yada), and it becomes not about taste, but simply repetition or familiarity. Then like grows to love, and before you know it, you know every word to every song on both albums. At least that's how it happened for me. The movie became an extension of that guilty pleasure. Nothing more, nothing less. Judge not, lest ye listen to some band that someone else equivocates to the Spice Girls.",4.0
"Waiting for Indiana Jones IV to come to pass, it is always time to reflect on the sad state of Harrison Ford's career, and as we flip through the years it seems to me he hasn't had a bona fide hit since 1997.  (2000's WHAT LIES BENEATH probably made money, but few credit Ford's presence in that thriller for its success; possibly it was a hit due to the well-tuned script and the expert direction by Robert Zemeckis. In any case Michelle Pfeiffer--another star of the 1990s whose career has gone sadly awry--deserves half the credit as well.)  Otherwise it's like a list of one disaster after another.  K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER?  Dead in the water.  HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE?  Not a bad show but the public stayed away in droves.  RANDOM HEARTS?  When you look up ""catastrophe"" in the dictionary you get a still from this movie.  SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS?  Awful.  WATER TO WINE (2004)?  Even his fans don't know what it is!  I'm not sure FIREWALL will break the curse either, it sounds like a re-tread of an earlier Ford flop called FRANTIC.

So when we look back and try to find the last good patch of Harrison Ford's once invincible streak, we come up with a thump against this indisputable box office sensation, which rules the theaters world wide for a brief spell in 97.  The critics thought it piffle, but it answered a need in the US public, maybe to see a strong president defying the Russians one last time.  Reactionary?  No two moviegoers will read its plot the same way, but there are certainly cimilarities to the FOX TV hit ""24,"" which it foreshadowed in so many ways, even down to the canny use of amiably sinister Xander Berkeley, the husband in SAFE.  And of course the death defying traumas that occur to Air Force One in both programs.

Most of all, I think people long for a president who's more like James Marshall here, than the one we had in 1997 or the one we have now.  He's a father figure, he's still vigorous and sexy, he's got a good sense of humor, knows his way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close.

AIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford, whose previous films had been major disappointments--the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL'S OWN with Brad Pitt.  I think at that minute we really needed Harrison Ford to start thinking about how to sustain a career.  Instead he just must have said Ah Screw It and switched the remote to a then-new TV show called ALLY McBEAL.  The rest is film history.",4.0
"One of Harrison Ford's better and least appreciated performances, Air Force One is a thrilling film that makes the most of its action hero star and his unique bond with movie going audiences. In Air Force One, Ford plays the role of President of the United States. In the same way that it's near impossible to envision any other actor in the role of Indiana Jones, it's difficult to envision anyone else as president for this film. Ford projects the image of such a strong, honorable, and likeable leader that the audience is immediately rooting for him.

Originally released in 1997, Ford plays President James Marshall, a Vietnam vet turned president who makes it clear in a stunning speech at a Moscow dinner that America will now pursue a ""zero tolerance"" policy on international terrorism (sound familiar?). Boarding Air Force One for the return flight home from Moscow, Marshall is joined by his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and his daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews). He's also joined by a contingent of Eastern European journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).

Unbeknownst to the President and his fellow Air Force One passengers, the group of men aren't journalists at all, but instead an elite team of terrorists bent on taking the president hostage. With a Secret Service agent (Xander Berkeley) collaborating with the terrorists, Korshunov has intimate inside knowledge of the procedures and safeguards deployed to protect the president on Air Force One. When Secret Agent Gibbs (Berkeley) opens the onboard weapons cache of Air Force One, his terrorist friends carry out a methodic plan to eliminate the president's security circle.

At the sound of gunfire, President Marshall is hurriedly raced below deck to an escape pod so as to avoid his capture. With the pod jettisoned, Korshunov is enraged that the original plan failed. But his original goal remains intact, and the terrorist decides that the president's family and the remaining passengers will make do as hostages. Negotiating with the acting Vice President (Glenn Close) in the President's absence, Korshunov demands the release of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a communist hardliner who Korshunov believes will bring back the Soviet Union and restore the intoxicating glory of its empire years. With a well laid and executed plan, Korshunov's demands are met and arrangements are made to release General Radek. But what Korshunov doesn't know is that President Marshall is still onboard, having jettisoned an empty escape pod, and he's intent on freeing his family and kicking the terrorists off his plane...

Filled with action and some memorable one-liners, Air Force One is a classic Harrison Ford action thriller along the lines of Patriot Games and Clear And Present Danger. In addition, prior to filming Air Force One, the producers were given unprecedented access to the real thing. The result is a film that displays the inner sanctums of Air Force One with stunning accuracy, providing the audience with a glimpse into the actual traveling life of the most powerful man in the world. Overall, this a must-see movie that you won't want to miss...

"Another great performance by Harrison Ford. This is a nice action film that moves along quickly, making it wonderful entertainment!",4.0
"It sad how everyone tries to politicize what is essentially a popcorn-drenched exercise in entertainment. This President is loving, compassionate and tough. No matter what your political bent, isn't that what we're all looking for? A president who lives, and acts by his own convictions?

But that's not true is it?

This is a dumb, but very fun, action picture with a preposterous premise. The script ain't great. The acting, however, is really top-notch, in the fact that you buy into all of it. I couldn't imagine the film working at all with out Ford and Oldman.

It's not supposed to be any sort of comment on the current state of world affairs, how could it be? It was made YEARS before the WTC attack. You have to look at it as a personal story. It takes the inherant drama of a man with power being placed in a position where it means nothing, the ratcheting it up by placing what he holds most dear in jeopardy.

Yes, symbolism abounds, but when the most powerful man in the world is the President of the United States, how can it not? But watch how the film spends more time on what he is NOT, which is superhuman, rather than what he is.",4.0
"Air Force One is probably one of the best and realistic movies ever made. In the world after 9-11, you would wonder if this can happen to the real Air Force One... The world's most safest aircraft with the president of the United States, touted as the most powerful man in the world on board, being hijacked is just a nightmare...

This movie has what you would expect from a typical action packed movie that involves hijackers on a plane. What I love abt this movie is the details put together to make the Air Force One set look just like its counterpart in the real world.. Great effort!

Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman is just brilliant in this movie! They are the stars!

A pity though that this DVD is lacking great extras such as a behind the scenes look or interviews with the cast. I would love to know how they built the set for Air Force One.

"Harrison Ford is the president of the United States whose Air Force One plane is hijacked by a team of Russian terrorists. As an intense, action packed adventure this one's pretty good.  Gary Oldman gives another stellar performance as the leader of the terrorists. He's truly a chameleon.  Name me another actor who could play anyone from Lee Harvey Oswald (JFK) to Beethovan (Immortal Beloved)?!?
So here I'm going to concentrate my review on the Columbia Tristar super-hyped ""Superbit"" series and I can sum up my evaluation in three little words - DON'T BE FOOLED!  While it's true that packing on excessive extra features and a feature film onto one side of a DVD ""can"" result in a loss of digital quality in the transfer, this is not really an issue when the movie itself runs just under the two hour mark and the extra features amount to a fifteen minute ""making of"" featurette and some theatrical trailers.
THIS TRANSFER IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED DVD.
Having stated this, the fidelity of this transfer is outstanding.  Colors are well balanced and bold.  Edge enhancement, pixelization and shimmering are non-existant. Fine details are extremely sharp.  The audio is earth-shattering.  Overall a great, great job from Columbia Tristar.  One problem: they already did just as much on the original DVD release.  Hence, this time around is really just a waste of disc space.
There are no extras but hey, that's Columbia being true to form.

"Okay, so it might be a stretch of the imagination that the presidential jet can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine gun fire. That aside, ""Air Force One"" poses the (then) unlikely premise of a terrorist group commandeering the First Plane (maybe not so unlikely now) and how Harrison Ford, as a strict anti-terrorist commander-in-chief, has to abort the plot while saving not only himself but the First Family. Ford, one of the acting business' most professional artists, is absolutely believeable as both the most powerful man in the Free World and a family man, often struggling not to let the lines of both intersect. The multi-talented Gary Oldman (Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula,"" ""The Contender"") is in his element as the thoroughly and dastardly evil leader of the terrorist group, and the incomparable Glenn Close is riveting as the loyal Vice President who refuses to grab the reigns of power as long as her president stays alive. But Close's bigger contribution is her unparalled ability to convey her character's sense of subdued panic while maintaining calm as an uncertain nation looks on. Director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") has come up with a terrific nail-biter despite a couple of stretches of imagination. And, as for Ford's role as president, even Indiana Jones would have his hands full with the guy. Fast-moving with seldom a lapse in the action, this one is well worth the watch.",4.0
"It's easy to understand why Air Force One was such a big hit. The President saves the country. America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from evil again. Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts (fueled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President at the time.

But the film is very good in it's own right too. Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likeable hero and Oldman as Korshunov, a rotten villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch, though some of the CGI is way below par for your average blockbuster. The R-rating helps. If this were made today it would be PG-13 garbage, but the blood spatters, swearing and body count make you believe that ANY character could die next.

But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson has a pretty bad role as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because the President needs to have a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to `SHUT UP!' echoing the feeling of every viewer.

If you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces. Very cool.

"Despite a plot that strains credibility at times, AIR FORCE ONE is still a superior action film thanks to the always-reliable Harrison Ford and the steady hand of German director Wolfgang Petersen (DAS BOOT; IN THE LINE OF FIRE).
Ford portrays President James Marshall, who has just given a speech decrying international terrorism and warning those that would use terrorism for political purpose, ""Your day is over.""  But when a truly despicable Russian national (Gary Oldman) and his men forcibly take over the President's plane, holding not only his staff, but even more importantly his wife and daughter, as hostages, Ford is forced to take matters into his own hands.  The result is not always plausible, and some of the special effects don't work quite as well as they should, but one cannot fault the film's pace or the tension and excitement inherent in the story.
Ever since playing Han Solo in STAR WARS and Indiana Jones in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Ford has developed into a leading man of the action genre--the thinking man's action hero.  That aspect blossomed in PATRIOT GAMES, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, and, especially THE FUGITIVE; and here in AIR FORCE ONE he gets to play the most important man in the world.  He does it with considerable style.  Glenn Close was also a cagey choice to play the first female vice-president, and she does this with incredible fortitude.  William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell are equally fine in supporting roles as part of the President's staff.  And Oldman, whose performance as Oswald in Oliver Stone's JFK was a miracle performance, is equally superlative as the villain, matching the Bruce Willis/Alan Rickman pairing in DIE HARD.
Petersen's direction, despite some missteps, never allowed the film to sag; and Jerry Goldsmith's music score is appropriately patriotic without being sickeningly so, and always suspense-building.  This is a film well worth watching.  Don't miss it, especially if you're a fan of such situational thrillers.",4.0
"Air Force One has been hijacked by terrorists demanding a great deal from the president. they hoped to find him in the plane, but not the way they had hoped. the acting is great in this film by both harrison ford and gary oldman. gary oldman will be the Christopher Lee of the future, always playing the bad guy, but always getting a part in a movie. the most powerful scene in the movie is when the president has to decide on the fate of his family. is national security more important than his own family?",4.0
"Air Force One is one of my favourite action films, as it is for many people, and it's easy to see why. Wolfgang Petersen's action thriller starring Harrison Ford as the president of America is a taut, exciting action flick (And sure to never be in-flight entertainment).
Gary Oldman is the movie's main villain, a terrorist with some scores to settle. Both he and Ford are great, and with the added start power of William H.Macy and Glenn Close make this big-name action-fest great fun.
Performances, action scenes, special effects and music (Jerry Goldsmith) are all top-notch, as well as some great patriotic stuff from Harrison. The only thing I don't like is some scenes are predictable and jingoism takes over sometimes. Regardless, it's great fun, and an equally great DVD. Cool stuff.",4.0
"After making a speech to the world about a no-tolerence policy againgst terrorism, the president's plane is hijacked by terrorists.  This is an amazing film.  The plot is superb, and the action is great.  Harrison Ford is an astounding actor, and plays a president/father with super accuracy.  The stunts in this movie are great, including a scene with a refueling tanker, and a scene where the president must ride a tether to get out of the plane.",4.0

"I first saw this film in theaters ten years ago when I was 14 - the age of the prime target Spice Girls fan at that time - and I absolutely hated it. So I have no idea what drove me to watch it again now, let alone buy it. But it seems that the wisdom that comes with growing older, and growing out of a taste for teen pop, leaves me with an ability to finally appreciate Spice World for what it is: a slight, yet unpretentious and oftentimes hilarious film that doesn't take itself too seriously and is having an awful lot of fun doing it.

Seriously, the Spice Girls seem to be natural comediennes. Their comic timing is brilliant, and they all have personality to spare. (Their lip-synching abilities are another matter.) There's also an amazing host of well-known British actors who you'd normally think wouldn't be caught dead in a film like this - Alan Cummings, Bob Hoskins, Stephen Fry for starters. I particularly loved Richard E. Grant as their uptight, controlling manager. I recognized him as the devious butler from Gosford Park, and his character here is a complete 180 of that.

Forget the paper-thin, near-pointless plot - something involving a pregnant best friend, the pressures of fame and too many gigs, yadda yadda yadda. When you're having this much fun watching a movie, who needs a story to make sense of all the insanity and inanity?",4.0
"The movie pulse review above is a little too short sighted to understand why people would enjoy this film. Their review is more like the kind of arrogant criticism you'd expect from these self proclaimed critics
. Movies are enjoyable for a number of reasons. First you have what some consider high art. A lot of times although these films are original and at times can have great imagination they normally are not very fun to watch and are generally boring. You also have your big blockbuster movies with huge budgets. Hollywood movies that put millions of dollars into everything from actors to their catering. Once and a while hollywood can hit the mark and many of us can name off a few films in this category we enjoy but, we all know that big dollars do not always equal entertainment nor a good film. Then you have your independant and B-films.  Films with smaller budgets that do what they can with what they have. In terms of fun and entertainment they are much the same as the high budget films (hit and miss). Lastly and more to the point we have campy films. Some are not intended to be and some are. What can generally be agreed upon is that when we watch  movies such as these we don't watch them because they'll win some sort of award (how shallow is it to only enjoy films because they can or have won an oscar). No, we watch these movies(and movies in general)for their intended reason...To be entertained and have a good time. This seems to be what moviepulse has forgotten. Their review is more intent on picking apart the film for it's lack of ""Academy Award"" standards in which all films must apparently shoot for in order to get good reviews. They forgot to tell us if the movie was fun watch. They neglected to say if there were audiences out there that found this film enjoyable. their review is unbias and narrow minded.

This gets me to my point. The spice girls movie is by no means an award winner but if you enjoy campy films that will make you laugh and leave you feeling entertained when they are over then give this movie a chance. Of course this was a Spice Girl vehicle. They were at the height of their popularity. Anything they would have done would have been seen that way. The movie resemble the Beatles ""a hard days night""? Well try and find a film that does not pilfer from another. A lot of times films a slammed because they resemble another film. Most movies are this way and few films are so fresh and new as to boast complete originality. I own this movie and watch it regularly. Many of my friends did not want to watch it. They had the same ""noses turn up"" view of this movie as moviepulse yet after one viewing they not only liked it but have seen it multiple times after the fact. if you like the spice girls then it's a no brainer but if you don't I still recommend this film. It's a riot and you'll have  great time watching it.",4.0
"The airplane carrying the US President gets hijacked and the president may be the only person who can save the hostage and get the plane down.
This is an unrealistic action movie (unfortunately it doesn't seem quite as unrealistic anymore).

It's well written, and very thrilling, with good actors, especially Harrison Ford and Glenn Close. I have seen few action thrillers that were more entertaining than this one. It kept me at the edge of my seat for two hours and a couple of minutes. I highly recommend it! This is action at its best!",4.0

"It was good to see Roger Moore, no longer James Bond 007, in a film again. This time he plays a character that looks very much like his nemesis Blofeld. Instead of a cat he now keeps a pig in his lap. Very cool idea! As with David Lean's DOCTOR ZHIVAGO it is about a few years in the turbulent life of the all-female Anglo-Soviet assembly. The Spy and Spice Girls have plenty of character, and that helps make up for the lack of action and adventure that keeps their movie debut from being a truly epic motion picture. The concert scene at Albert Hall in London was very reminiscent of Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It was kind of a 90's version on some of his themes as well as David Lean's and those of the Bond producers. However, it has a potential of being cult epic like AUSTIN POWERS. Perhaps not. Perhaps time will be kind to these spicy gals.",4.0

With the fates of the world & his family both hanging in balance, it up to the president to kick some butt.

"You want to see some hijacking terrorists get their butts kicked by Harrison Ford? Well, this does the trick. A lot of folks complained about the supposed unrealistic nature of this film, but I think we know now that it isn't as unrealistic as we would have hoped. As far as this movie goes, it is a thrill ride that is sort of like Die Hard on Air Force One, with the president playing the John McClane character in place of Mr. Willis. The terrorists are complex in their rationale, but ultimately, like all terrorists, they are evil at heart. Frankly, it's a bit unnerving to watch it all happening on the screen. But unrealistic is not the word to use any more. Sure, parts of it strain credulity, but so does virtually every action adventure film (automatic weapons fire never seems to actually hit the good guys in Rambo, or Mr. Schwarzenneger, or Mr. Willis, for example).
In fact, I was sold on this movie mainly by the performance of Ford, who does an absolutely Oscar-caliber portrayal of the kind of president we all imagine in our dreams. He brings a believability and an integrity to every character he plays, whether it be as president, Han Solo or Indiana Jones.
This ultimately isn't exactly deep, and it is somewhat derivative, but it's still a great action flick. And it may be just what you need right now.",4.0

Yes, it's predictable, shallow and inane, but it's also adorable, quirky and off-the-wall in a good, Monty Python sort of way. It actually works! Say and think what you will, I LIKE IT!

"Air Force One
Score: 69/100
Wolfgang Petersen, that is a great name isn't it? He made The Boat, In the Line of Fire and numerous other classics. Well, is Air Force One really as good as his older movies? No, the answer is no. But it's not as far off as you may have heard. Air Force One is awesome entertainment, and although it has its share of flaws in the script, you probably won't even notice because you'll be too enthralled with the high-flying adventure.
The President of the USA (Harrison Ford) goes to Moscow and gives a stirring speech outlining the USA's new ""Zero-tolerance"" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists actually take over Air Force One (the President's official plane) and take the passengers (including his wife and daughter) hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour unless/until their demands are met. However, the President is a former Medal of Honour winner, so the terrorists may be in for a surprise...
We are certainly in for tonnes of surprises. The action is blasting and will grab you when you least expect it and the visual effects are a treat to the eye. The story is weak, but the action delivers plenty of goods and it the films makes darn sure that you and your head won't be turning away from the screen to go to sleep. Harrison Ford is good, but, surprisingly, it's Glenn Close who plays Vice President Kathryn Bennett that really steals the show. Sure, Harrison takes all the action, but Glenn is more powerful. The cheesy lines such as ""Get off my plane!"" and some silly sequences don't do the film any good. But, it's got plenty of eye-candy and goodness about it with the thrills and most of the performances, so don't worry too much.
Air Force One has some small flaws, but it is still cracking entertainment with a good plot and breathtaking visual effects.",4.0
"I actually just bought this DVD a few days ago.  I was fairly astounded at the visual quality of the movie, even in full screen mode.  The sound was nothing to marvel at (the gunshots, however, did sound really defined on my 5.1 surround sound system).  But I didn't buy the movie for Ford, the sound, or even the amazing clarity of its visuals.  I really bought Air Force One because of its supporting cast and its ""in your face"" directorial style (Wolfgang Petersen's trademark).  From William H. Macy to Gary Oldman to Glen Close to many others, this movie really shines in its supporting cast (the plane included, who gives a stunning performance, without even a stunt double).  However, an outstanding supporting cast does usually mean that the lead role (or roles) isn't doing his or her job.  I think that's the only area where this movie fails to be convincing.
Don't think I'm against Harrison Ford or anything.  I believe these kinds of movies make the public feel very patriotic.  And I believe that if Harrison Ford ran for president, he would probably be victorious.",4.0
"To me the best thing about this film is the fact that the American point of view is not the only one given voice.  There was much truth to what Gary Oldman's character says to the President about american involvement abroad.  And as such, for one of the first times, an american film is not so pro american.  Bravo!
Now to detract.  If our secret service is as inept as they were portrayed in this film I feel sorry for the President.  And I have to say that at times certain scenes came off incredibly staged and unrealistic.  And some scenes just seemed very inplausible.
All that said I have to say that the film is very entertaining.  I just wouldn't rate Air Force One as a purchase.",4.0
"Air Force One is about a president, played by the tough Harrison Ford, who after authorizing the kidnapping of a former Russian republic president for acts of terrorism, faces his own troubles. Air Force One, the most sophisticated aircraft in the sky, is hijacked by a group of Russian terrorists trying to get their leader free from jail. But they did not count on the president fighting back!
With his wife and daughter on the plane, Ford must race against time to save them. Glenn Close, as the Vice President on the ground, becomes acting president after Ford is presumed dead. She tries to talk down the terrorists, the leader played by Gary Oldman, in his most terrifying role ever. But with no success, it is up to Ford to take them out.
This film has some of the best action scenes in a long time, and the DVD transfer is fantastic. This was released close to the birth of the DVD format, so there isn't a whole lot of extras on it. But the picture is nearly perfect and the sound is very good. If you have a dolby digital encoder, you will be in heaven! I subtracted one star only because there were not more bonus features on it. but other than that, this one is an entertainer!",4.0
"Back in 1997 when the Spice Girls ruled the charts 2 years after what I like to call the Ace of Base era and before the boy/girl band/group era, no could ever imagine the girls being in a movie. But that is what people got and even now 7 years later, it is still a fun ride if not a little outdated.

For anyone who remembers the phenonom that was the Spice Girls, you can not but conjure up some thoughts (let them be negative or positive) about their rein. Their music was catchy and when listening to it in this day and age can bring a person to a calmer time in life.

If you grew up in the latter part of the 90's you cannot fullly appreicate this movie no matter how hard you try.

The reason for this is that the movie just has no plot. I will agree with everyone else and say that this movie is completely pointless. But that does not make it a bad movie. It actually makes it more of a golden treat.

Cashing in on their popularity, this movie was made by mixing the girls, fictional characters, aliens, nostalgic and outdated jokes (by todays standards) and complete nonsense. It does it all in a clever formula.

The most rewarding part of the movie for anyone though has to be the first time you see the girls faces. You remember them in your head, but when you actually see them on screen for the first time in 7 years, you can not help but to admire their beauty for several minutes on end. They look great. Posh is still hot, Baby is innocence done right, Sporty is still a cutie, Scary is still scary in a good way, and Geri just looks fine.

Overall, this movie is a great way to spend a hour and a half on a weekend esp. if you want to go back a time when everyone was happy. Literally.",4.0
"I like this movie because it was action-packed and suspenseful. At first, I didn't want to see it but my dad made me. I'm glad he did. The DVD version has better sound quality and sharper imaging. I only gave it four stars because, even when the cold war was over, this American-made movie potrayed Russians as terrorizing commies.",4.0
Harrison Ford played the role of President of the United States very well.  And he expressed solemnity as the President and humor as Harrison Ford.  The story line is not as simple as it seemed at first sight. It is  elaborated in great detail.  This film is not showy but worthseeing.  Thank  you.,4.0
"I know that special effects are supposed to make a story better, but this is one case where they ruin the film to a certain extent. ""Air Force One"" contains a terrific storyline, along with a great cast of stars.  Harrison Ford plays the President who, along with his family and Cabinet  members, are beginning a return journey from Russia, where they have  kidnapped the self=proclaimed leader of a small country on the brink of  rebellion. Before take-off, a camera crew boards the plane, headed by Gary  Oldman. Soon, the camera crew is revealed as being a group of terrorists  who begin killing at random and hold the remaining survivors hostage in  return for the release of their leader. Ford makes the president a true  hero as he tries to stop the plane and the terrorists, and the story never  stops moving as things unfold. However, the special effects are not  believable in all places, and while the majority of the shots look honestly  true, there is always something to give away the computer wizardry. This  movie is a good movie, and I reccommend watching it on DVD instead of VHS  for better experiencing of this film.",4.0
This is a good movie from start to finish. Harrison Ford plays the hero role to the limit. Gary Oldman plays an absolutely mean and scary villain. He shows no remorse about shooting an unarmed hostage or using violence.  The plot of this movie is outstanding. The idea that these Russian thugs  could use the disguise of journalists was unique. Evev the secret service  agent who goes bad is portrayed as being wormy. The ending makes Harrison  Ford out to be a hero. A very good movie.,4.0
"Legendary German film director Wolfgang Petersen brings on another heart-pounding, steel-reinforced, political action-thriller.
The cold-war is over but that hardly means that some don't want to exert their muscle  over the United States. This high-flying adventure is not just another  ""airplane got hijacked"" type of movie. Rather, it is a special  effects and stunt extravaganza which stretches the last vein of adrenaline  and uses a great line-up of actors to do so. Harrison Ford leads the free  world as well as the 40,000 foot high adventure as President James  Marshall. A group of pro-Soviet patriates, led by who else but the most  convincingly psychotic actor on screen, Gary Oldman , have taken over the  presidential aircraft known as Air Force One in order to grab the Western  world by the  b---s (and they do a thorough job of it) in order to ensure  that their leader, one General Radek, played by Jurgen Prochnow, ( Das  Boot, The Man Inside,  English Patient) is freed in order for him to  attempt to restore his regime and take a shot at the title of the being new  Stalin. The cast also includes Glenn Close as the swift-thinking,  decision-making (or is she?)  vice-president and Wendy Crewson, who has  appeared in such films as The Doctor and To Gillian, On Her 37th Birthday,  as the First Lady. This is not another Executive Decision or another  Turbulence. Instead it is arguably the best action, A-list film of the  year. The special effects enhanced by digital sound are remarkable.

"Like most other Spice Girls fans of the time, I saw this at the movies. I was only 11. I'm 16 now, and I still like to watch this film from time to time. I still have a laugh at some of the scenes, and I've seen it so many times I can recite the lines along with the girls!
I look at the bad reviews of the movie, and wonder how many people have actually WATCHED the movie? Did they just give it one star because they hate the Spice Girls? I think that was probably the case for most reviewers. Congratulations to the people who gave it 4 or 5 star reviews - you're not ashamed to admit you liked the movie! I also liked it. The Spice Girls may not be popular anymore or what you'd call the latest thing, but they were a fantastic girl band. I bet nearly everyone had at least one song they liked from the girls.
But anyway, onto the movie itself. It's damn hilarious! I don't know how so many people didn't think it was funny! I think it's amusing now, and it's been 6 years since it came out in the theatres. The storyline is a bit thin, I have to admit, but the jokes are funny, not cheesy. I especially like the bit where Geri and Mel B are playing chess and Mel B doesn't understand the rules and Geri says she's gonna slap her. Also another funny bit is the part where Victoria says she doesn't know what to wear, and Mel C muses over whether Victoria should wear the ""little Gucci dress, the little Gucci dress OR the little Gucci dress"" as Mel C says. Then Emma chimes in ""I think you should wear the little Gucci dress!"". I like the part near the end where the two movie directors are telling the story to Clifford and everything is happening to the girls.
The cheesy parts of the movie include the aliens and the part on the boat. The most dramatic part of the film is the bit where the Spice Girls are having a fight with Clifford and they all storm off.
The movie begins with a Top Of The Pops version of ""Too Much"" and ends with a fantastic performance of ""Spice Up Your Life"". The rest of the Spiceworld album is played during the movie.
My favourite Spice Girl is Emma, and she had some funny lines during the movie.
Overall, Spiceworld is a funny movie that doesn't deserve all the negative reviews.",4.0
"Album: 5 stars
Motion Picture: 4 stars

At the height of girl power, when ""Baby"", ""Posh"", ""Scary"", ""Sporty"" and ""Ginger"" were words regularly spoken in all parts of the globe, the famous five dropped their sophomore album (and accompanying movie) ""Spiceworld"".  A little more outspoken, vibrant, mature and innovative, this album one ups the Spice Girls debut in attitude, but lacks the freshness.  In other words, if ""Spice"" was the girls' declaration, ""Spiceworld"" was their confirmation.

I'm a Spice Girl junkie: My walls were plastered with photos, and I had several pairs of platform shoes (which regularly caused sprained ankles).  I wore my hair in pigtails, flashed girl power/peace hand signs everywhere and owned a Spice keychain.  But that's beside the point.  The Spice Girls were a novelty, no doubt.  But while they lasted, they were fun.  ""Spiceworld"" achieves fun with ease and showcases bolder lyrics from the girls.  This could be considered a concept album: Many of the songs allude to a world ruled by the Spices, and what the result of such an impossibility would be.  The album artwork itself is unique, with each girl appearing at her spicy best and a backdrop of stars with the lone Planet Spice floating by.

In many ways, this album feels a bit more retro than ""Spice"", and is far more diverse.  There are obvious references to disco scattered throughout, such as ""Never Give Up On The Good Times"", ""Denying"" and ""Do It"", all peppy and uppity numbers designed mostly to get the listener up and moving around.  ""Never..."" does the best job, opening with an addictive drum loop and transitioning into a syncopated organ melody: The message screams girl power, with lyrics encouraging women who may have lost their edge to regain their strength and beauty.  The song has always been a favorite of mine, and would have been a great single.  It embodies the spirit of the Spice Girls perfectly.  ""Stop"" sounds a bit like something you might have heard back in the 50's or 60's, especially during the chorus.  It's very sugary, lighthearted and fast.  ""Move Over"" cranks it up a notch with guitars and lots of distortion (very 80's).  The lyrics are pretty innovative and there's a lot of rapping between the ladies.  ""The Lady Is A Vamp"" is the girls' musical montage of idols and heroes, backed by flirty horns and clarinets.  ""Spice Up You Life"" is one of the Spices signature tunes, loaded with fire, drama and lots of exotic instrumentation.  ""Saturday Night Divas"" opening melodies are instantly appealing and while the rest of the track isn't much to scream about, the vocals alone make it worthwhile.

The exciting dance tracks convey girl power, but it's the lush ballads that really showcase the girls' vocals.  ""Too Much"", the song used to open the girls film debut, oozes sophistication and uncertainty.  For the first time, the Spices seemed to really put some emotion into what they were singing.  The vocals are accompanied by a fabulous string arrangement and a beautifully executed horn solo.  The best is yet to come with ""Viva Forever"".  One of the girls most beloved tracks, it includes some wonderful low melodies and emits raw emotion accompanied by Latin undertones.  A Spanish guitar frequently adds sensitivity and romance to the track.

The Spice Girls were never fantastic singers, but they worked with what they had, amped the sassiness and sang with gusto.  Despite a short reign, breakup, seemingly infinite hiatus, and a reunion spoiled by lack of enthusiasm and nostalgia, the Spice Girls made their mark in history.  The world is much more fun for it.

(See below for the ""Spice World"" motion picture review)

Lets face it.  Anybody who loved the Spice Girls was mostly in love with the attitude, the look and the companionship between the ladies.  I know this because I have always been a huge fan, since February 1997.  The Spice Girls gave young teenage girls a reason to want to be gorgeous, witty and smart, and they gave the boys a reason to love women, body and mind.  After Geri's departure and even after the unoffical breakup of the band, Spiceworld has lost none of it's flavor.

Not meant to be a tear-jerker, action film or any form of comic genius, the movie was purely meant for fun and publicity.  What many didn't expect was the movie's ability to take even the biggest Spice haters and make them laugh, even if it was AT the girls themselves.  Cleverly written in glorious Britain comedic form, the girls took their roles and ran with them, exaggerating every bit of their personalities.  This movie is a fantasy, what the world would be like if it all revolved around the Spice girls.

There's a bus with an interior much larger than it appears on the outside, a band that goes by the girls' schedule (even if it means taking a two hour break to visit with pregnant friend Nicolla), a director whose soul purpose in life it seems is to create a documentary about the girls in a realistic environment, and strangely enough nobody mauls the ladies when they're roaming freely in clubs or on the street.  But who cares, this film is meant to take you to another universe anyway.

Almost every line is a memorable one, especially the lines between ladies.  ""I'm always going to be known as Baby Spice, even when I'm... thirty!""  Emma pouts.  ""I never know what to wear...""  moans the vivacious Vicky.  ""My boots Geri, you're wearing my boots!""  Screams Mel B as her usual loud self.  ""Why do people stereotype us, all the time?""  The peacemaker Mel C sighs.  ""If you're looking for a fight, you're gonna lose!""  The bubbly and bright Geri strikes again.  There's dozens more lines that you'll remember after you watch this film.  And it's not just the girls that get the great lines, the supporting characters do as well.

Not only does the film have clever writing, but the color in the movie is great.  The girls wear their brightest outfits, and everywhere they go, the colors seem to come to life around them.  There's one particular scene where the girls perform in Spain and the body-builder dancers wear pastel purple suits.  The girls' bus is a giant British flag driving down the road, and the inside is lush with color.  Another great scene is the photo shoot, where the girls wear various costumes including Marilyn Monroe, Danny and Sandy from Grease, and they also dress up as each other which is the best part.

Another big perk the movie is its soundtrack, made up of entirely Spice Girl songs.  All the big hits including Say You'll Be There, 2 Become 1, Too Much and even Wannabe (done as a version before the girls got big) are in the movie.

A mindless but perky movie, Spiceworld is fun and entertaining.  In the end, the girls finally make it to the theater to perform their concert and even the cop in the audience is dancing.  Unrealistic... yes.  Unenjoyable?  Goodness no.",4.0
"Harrison Ford, Anne Archer, Glenn Close, and Gary Oldman star in an action-packed hit from Columbia Pictures that flies so high it won't come back down.  Ford stars as U.S. President James Marshall, who boards  Air Force One for a flight, when terrorists (one played by Gary Oldman)  hijack the plane.  Like ""Executive Decision""(I recommend you  watch that awesome film) and ""Passenger 57"" (a cool movie), the  plot revolves around a hijacked plane.  This particular movie is an awesome  adventure and just as good as ""Executive Decision"" (stars Kurt  Russell and Halle Berry), and to me is even better than ""Passenger  57"" (stars Wesley Snipes).  Glenn Close plays the female vice  president, and Anne Archer plays the first lady, Marshall's wife.  This  spectacular piece is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, who also directed  ""In The Line Of Fire"", an awesome thriller starring Clint  Eastwood, John Malkovich, and Rene Russo.",4.0
"This was a great film but it let itself down with the ending. In truth , Hollywood wrote this ending so that the good old USA trumiphs over evil again (and the box office isn't harmed again). But up until that point ,  this was up their with the best of them as Harrison finds himself aboard a  hijacked Air Force One. The vice president (Glenn Close) finds herself  eventually almost forced to rule that the president is making decisions not  as a leader but as a family man and that as a result of this she MUST take  charge. The film looks as though it may take this view but then about turns  and declares that the Vice President makes a brillant decision by not only  giving in to the terrorists who then reveal that they would not let the  president go anyway and will use him as a political tool. Now at the end of  the film the President escapes and the film in a few scenes shows her as  having solved this crisis - presumably she knew that the president would  become Rambo and save the day. Good movie until this point after that  typical American Schmaltz (but still great fun)",4.0
I luved this movie because it was very suspensful. One time I thought Harrison Ford was going to be captured but I would have never expected him to make the jets fire at the plane. I think that was pretty realistic.,4.0
"Is it possible for Harrison Ford to make a bad movie? Maybe, but ""Air Force One"" ain't it. This is a riveting movie about a terrorist group hijacking the world's most well-known airplane, while the President (played  by Ford) must single-handedly defeat them. From Ford's performance to the  special effects to the music, this is a wonderful film.
Wolfgang  Petersen, the maker of the terrifically gripping ""Das Boat"",  directs here and lends the film a terrific sense of claustrophobia. The  cat-and-mouse game Ford plays with the terrorists will leave the audience  on the edge of their seat. Ford is the idealization of what every American  wants his Chief Executive to be- tough, a man of action, resourceful. The  same way Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart were film icons of the 1940s and  50s, Ford will come to be remembered as one of the great actors of the 80s  and 90s. His casting could not have been better.
Jerry Goldsmith's music  here is good, but not great (his score for ""U.S. Marshals"" was  better). I wasn't overly thrilled with Gary Oldman's performance as the  leader of the Russian terrorists (a little over-the-top at times) and I  wonder if the Russian nationalist plot hasn't been overdone by Hollywood. I  also didn't buy the climactic final rescue of the President from the  crashing plane. The rest of the cast is quite good however, and the action  is exciting.
On the balance, a pretty darn good movie.",4.0
"I found this film to be highly entertaining, although somewhat unrealistic.  I can accept this because, as a work of fiction, it is precisely that--unrealistic.  It had its moments of implausibility, but  overall these were forgiveable since we get to see a President who is  honorable, decent, and faithful to his beliefs and family--another huge  point of fiction considering the current administration.  The plane is a  bit different from the real thing (so I have been told), but that's ok.  Nothing presented in the plane is ""beyond belief.""  Even the  ""bullet resistant"" cabin is possible.  The movie is about  ""What if...""  Enjoy it for what it is.",4.0
"No, it's not ""War and Peace,"" but then, you didn't really expect an All-Spice rendition of ""MacBeth,"" did you?
The plot?  Well, that's beside the point, isn't it?  Something about a tour film, something about birthing babies, something about an evil tabloid plot to break up the Spice Girls (perish the thought!).  What miniscule plot there is serves mainly as an excuse for random cameos, multiple costume changes, and self-spoofing fantasy sequences, e.g. the girls as Charlie's Angels style fighters in ""SpiceForce 5"".  Oh yeah, there's music, too.  (Forward through the concert scenes if you're not a devotee of Spice sound or you just aren't really in a masochistic mood.)
It's all in high spirited goofy fun.  Even the always reliable Richard Grant looks like he's having a hoot.  As someone who doesn't own a Spice album (or even cooking spices for that matter, but that's a different story) and can't call herself a fan, I was genuinely surprised to find this movie so darn enjoyable.  I'm not saying I'd start a grass-roots campaign demanding a sequel (er, Spice Universe?), but this flick's amusingly silly and benignly entertaining -- not unlike the Spice Girls themselves.",4.0
"As with every movie, there are those who like it and those who don't. But I think the reviewers here on this site that don't like Spiceworld are missing the point. True, the Spice Girls aren't the best actors and the movie is offbeat, but Spiceworld is made to be just fun. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. It's a fictional documentary on the Spice Girls busy lives filled with cameo appearances and outrageous scenes, all for the purpose of fun. I really wish people would give this movie a chance and watch it for what it is.",4.0
"Although the airplane in the movie is nothing like the actual Air Force One, the public will never know the difference.  I found several parts of the movie hard to believe such as when the terrorists took over the  airplane just as it landed and they zig-zagged across the field just  missing other aircraft and buildings then taking off at the last moment to  avoid a catastrophie.  Harrison Ford is outstanding in this movie and it  all comes together in the end when the ""good guys"" win.",4.0
"Air Force One's premise does require quite a bit of suspension of disbelief, but this is easily done with the fine acting of Harrison Ford, Glen Close, and Gary Oldman.
But what really makes the DVD package so  complete is the commentary by the director.  Instead of some aimless  bantering that often makes up these commentaries, this one is done in an  interview style, which helps keep the discussion on track about the film.  There are only a few times when others films are mentioned within the  commentary, but then the discussion comes right back to the film.
The  disk is double-sided, with one side devoted to the wide-screen format and  the other side for standard.  Although I would have like to seen more  information about the production on the film, the excellent commentary  presented made up for it.",4.0
"A great movie for Harrison Ford fans.  Ranks with it's cousins Patriot Games and Clear & Present Danger.  One minor flaw for this military veteran reviewer - toward the end of the movie the President (Ford) asks an  Air Force major (William H. Macy) if he know how to fly, and the answer is  ""No"".  The major is wearing Master Pilot wings on his shirt, but  he doesn't know how to fly . . .",4.0

"A film that went unoticed in the 80's is a tight well acted thriller starring the incomparable Richard Gere as tough brash Chicago Cop who's on a revenge misson to the bayous of New Orleans to find his partner's killer and gets involved with a mobster's illerate mistress. Standard Script with a few good action sequences thrown in along with Gere's exceptional talent to hold the viewer's attention throughtout the entire film. Even though the viewer has been through familar territory with this type of script it is still a great movie. Memorable scene was when Gere & Bassinger are treding through the swamps handcuffed together Mouthing off to one another. First of two film this duo has done together the other film was released 6 years later in another steamy thriller ""Final Analysis""",4.0
"The Pre-Katrina scenery of  New Orleans  and of the bayou makes this a worthwhile movie to watch for the aesthetic.  The plot is believable but the chemistry of  Richard Gere and Kim Basinger's connection is a tad odd.  What does occur to me is that Gere's role of saviour to Basinger,  was a glimpse of early Gere activist tendencies.  His role in ""No Mercy"" seems like one he'd enjoy playing.",4.0
"Definitely a film of it's genre. 1986, Miami vice was all the rage, Hunter, etc....
Stars the Handsome, timeless, Richard Gere, a fave since 77's ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"". The beautiful Kim Basinger as a prostitute, ""Michelle"", from the bayou of Louisana. Not my favorite Gere film. Plenty of action, violence, mild gore , if that's your thing, this Gil right up your alley.",4.0
"This is another one of those movies I saw in the late 80's (on cable) already aware of the back story that Kim Basinger did not like working with Richard Gere and that they both were very upset about spending so much time in the movie being wet
I can see why.  There is lots of 'wet' in NO MERCY.
By the way, Gere must have been a difficult 'act' to work with because he and Debra Winger were at odds in Officer and a Gentleman, and there was a variety of production problems in Coppola'a ""The Cotton Club"" (as the story goes).  I'd assume Gere had something to do with that too.
But,
all that said, NO MERCY has a great look that begins in a pretty dreary Chicago and the gritty look does not change when locales change..
Gere is the aggressive Chicago cop who goes undercover and discovers somebody wants to hire him for a 'hit' on a no doubt about it ruthless New Orleans 'business' man with the gorgeous blonde, Cajun girl who was basically 'sold' to the 'Narlins scum by her own mother when she was 13.
Gere is always good as the wild card cop and/or loner type, and he will do just about anything to find the murder witness (Basinger).  Could she be involved more than we know?  Well, the race to the conclusion may be visible from an hour away but the ride is entertaining enough with the attractive leads in good form (Basinger really does do that ""shaking rage, so tired of being pushed around and manipulated fury"" well...).
I found the ending symbolic of a Western in ""Hell"" showdown.
Yep, not only did director Richard Pearce have his cast and crew playing in lots of water, but they also did an impressive job of playing with fire.
Keep in mind this was years before the movie Backdraft.
Street location footage and the hiding in the swamps of Louisiana footage help NO MERCY remain a credible viewing entertainment.  Some of the hard-boiled dialogue by the police Captain (George Dzundza, for example -- who is good otherwise) is too easy to laugh at:  ""I don't like you I don't wanna' swap spit ...(really?  It comes from out of no where too..) but, basically it's ""go get'tum tiger"".  Legalities have become an afterthought.
Check out NO MERCY for the good action, the real good visuals (includes Basinger's tastefully done, see through blouse when wet, of course...).
Just let some story implausibilities slide by and enjoy the buildup to Gere and Basinger's relationship and, of course, the action finale.
No need to overthink this one.  Sometimes looks are everything.  Basinger is beautiful and Gere is in the prime of his great hair days.

"Released in late 1986, ""No Mercy"" stars Richard Gere as a Chicago cop who travels to New Orleans to track down a blond (Kim Basinger) who is linked to the murderer of his beloved partner. The film features a great love-to-hate villain, Losado, played by Jeroen Krabb; a notable survival-in-the-swamp sequence wherein Gere & Basinger are handcuffed to eachother; and an action-packed showdown in an old city hotel.

Actually, I could do without the hotel showdown, as it comes off too cartooney and contrived (like when one of the villains barges right through a wall with his rifle -- Why sure!), but I suppose it can be accepted on the grounds of Western-like artistic license.

There's loads of foul language but I found it realistic for these types of individuals in such critical situations. So I didn't mind it too much but my wife took (minor) offense.

Gere's still relatively young here (36). I realize many hate him, but I'm a fan of quite a few of his pictures, e.g. ""The Mothman Prophecies"", ""King David"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". Kim Basinger doesn't do much for me personally, although she's certainly pretty and her acting is effective here. I know it's a matter of taste but ""No Mercy"" provides zero 'babe appeal' for me.

The film was shot in Chicago and Louisiana (and some parts in NC).

The score is moving despite the dated mid-80s electronic drums.

FINAL WORD: It's hard to put into words why I like this film to the extent of writing a review. It's nothing exceptional, but it somehow 'works' and gets better with repeat viewings. I bought the dvd a year & a half ago and have watched it three times since, which is something I rarely (if ever) do. I think what attracts me is that it's more than just a mindless cop/action flick, although it has the thrills if that's all you're looking for. ""No Mercy"" has something to say about love, loyalty, courage, justice, freedom and happiness, but it's smart enough to not spell it all out. Hence, not only is the picture enjoyable to watch due to the 'movie  magic' but it can also leave you contemplating.

The film runs 106 minutes.

It's wrong, and it's insulting to everyone who holds Christ dear.  And telling people to shove their Bibles where the sound doesn't shine is equally as insulting.

"This movie is the best proof that stage comedies do not transfer well to the screen.  The comedy lines that play well on stage sound forced and badly delivered in a movie and it's like they are trying to make the first part of the movie all comedy lines.  The badly done comedy scenes are spaced here and there throughout the movie.  I think it's just badly directed because some of the comedy lines are really funny but they sound so forced and artificial that you just cringe.  The drama scenes are for the most part very well done and well acted.  It's a good story with a lot of very good characters.  I found the forced southern accents badly done.  I'm from the south and I know what is natural and what isn't. But, all in all, it's an enjoyable movie.",4.0

This film isn't what I expected. Initially, it begins on a happy note by showing Peter Fonda and Dennis Hooper traveling across America on their motorcycles. There's a feeling of euphoria and freedom as we see beautiful landscapes and people waving to them. They pick up travelers along the way, visit a commune, swim in lakes, camp, and smoke pot. Ahhh, what a life of adventure.

However, events take a darker turn through intolerance. They just aren't welcome because they have long hair and are unshaven. Jack Nicholson, who plays an alcoholic civil rights lawyer, observes that it's fear and, maybe, jealousy of their free lifestyle. Nicholson gives a good performance and isn't the caricature that he later became. Eventually, the two bikers experience a bad acid trip and, finally, a senseless shooting.

I enjoyed Peter Fonda's performance. He conveys a lot of compassion with only a few lines here and there.

"What an awesome road movie. Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, and a young Jack Nicholson...it truly doesn't get any better. It's essentially a taste of the 1960s American counter-culture, glimpsed from the back of Fonda's motorcycle as it powers through the desert. His character is a guy in search of himself, much like that generation. He and Hopper's cross-country drive doubles as a spiritual awakening kind of experience. Experimentation with drugs, commune life, and the hippie ""free loving"" vibes are the cornerstones of this film. The American flag on Wyatt (Fonda)'s helmet and bike, as well as the familiar backdrop of the American Southwest, gives the whole movie an earthy, grassroots, Americana feeling. Not a lot of drive to the movie, as the main characters are kind of in personal limbo (rebels without a cause), but that's really the point. And can't we all relate?",4.0

"Too bad Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper never released their 3 1/2 hour original cut of Easy Rider. I guess what nowadays would be called the ""Director's Cut"", or the ""Extended Edition"". Peter Fonda showed this cut to his father, Henry, who liked it, and talked of releasing it after the theatrical version had played out. Back then, that would have meant a theatrical release, in the days before VHS cassettes and DVD's. On the music: CSN&Y's ""Find The Cost of Freedom"", performed acappella on their live album ""Four Way Street"" was originally written by Stephen Stills for the ending of the movie, but Fonda/Hopper instead used ""Flow River Flow"", written by Roger (nee Jim) McGuinn, and performed by the latest incarnation of The Byrds at the time (1969).

Rip Torn was originally cast for the part subsequently played by Jack Nicholson. However, Dennis Hopper got into a huge argument with Rip Torn, and pulled a knife on him (most likely a Buck Folding Hunter). Torn, having been an MP in the Army, quickly ""subdued"" Hopper, and left the production. Opening the door for Jack Nicholson, who Peter Fonda had worked with when acting in some Roger Corman films (such as The Trip, which I'm sure is available from Amazon). And the rest, as they say, for Jack Nicholson's career, is history.

After the incredible success of Easy RiderThe Wild Angels, starring Peter Fonda, The Glory Stompers, starring Dennis Hopper, and Hell's Angels on Wheels, starring Jack Nicholson, were packaged and re-released on a triple bill. I'm sure all of those movies are available from Amazon as well.

Eden was superb in the lead. She was amazing at conveying both sex appeal and innocence at the same time. The characters on the show are sometimes a little uneven by the way they're written from ep to ep but the talent of the actors overcomes this small fault. I liked the show much better when it switched to color (it was rather dour in black and white). And I like the married Genie stories as much as the eps where's she is single.,4.0
"The three episodes collected on ""Jeannie's Seeing Stars"" come from late in the run of the classic television sitcom ""I Dream of Jeannie.""  By this point Jeannie (Barbara Eden) is married to her master, Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman), with best friend Major Roger Healy (Bill Daily) still in on the secret, which is more than can be said for Dr. Alfred Bellows (Hayden Rorke).  None of these episodes would really be considered classics, but they are all certainly representative of the show:
""The Biggest Star in Hollywood"" (Episode #106) finds Tony heading for Hollywood, so Jeannie prepares a goodbye that shows up in a mirror.  The producers of ""Laugh-In"" are impressed by the trick and just have to have her on the show.  Seeing yet another opportunity to become rich and famous, Roger becomes the manager for the Princess Armena, and promises to have her on the show.  ""Laugh-In"" regulars Arte Johnson, Judy Carne, and Gary Owens appear in this average outing.
""Help, Help, a Shark"" (Episode #134) features Jim Backus as General Fitzhugh, the longtime rival of General Schaeffer (Vinton Hayworth), who are competing for a spot in the All-Military Pool Championships.  When Tony ruins Schaeffer's big game his only chance to avoid being sent to the North Pole is to play Fitzhugh in a rematch.  The good news is that with Jeannie on his side, Tony is sure to win.  The bad news is that Fitzhugh refuses to play with a woman in the room.  Of course a large part of the pleasure here is the guest appearance by Thurston Howell III himself, which makes this the best episode of this particular trio.
""My Master the Chili King"" (Episode #139) has Arvel (Gabriel Dell), who is Tony's cousin (twice removed) showing up and convincing Jeannie to invest $1,000 in his great recipe for Texas chili.  She buys his story that Tony has agreed to endorse the product and promptly blinks up cans with his picture on them and gets them on the shelves in every grocery store in the area.  The only problem is that NASA does not let its astronauts endorse products.  A solid outing as far as such things go, the episode also has Dick Van Patten as the clerk at the market.
As is usually the case, the big surprise is noting how good of a comic actor Larry Hagman was on this show, before he made his mark as J.R. Ewing on ""Dallas.""  Just watch how many times he gets to do an over the top reaction to Jeannie's antics in ""Help, Help, a Shark.""  Just do not look for Barbara Eden's navel, because although it did get seen a couple of times, these are not those episodes.",4.0

The motorcycle carried Jack Nicholson, but he carried the movie. Easy Rider is about Captain American penetrating the darkness that was the south and the racism of the time. Fonda and Hopper created a theme, but the quality acting was Nicholson. It is a movie in context and has to be understood as a response to the Vietnam war and the injustice of our time in history. The drugs were just the fuel to capture the freedom, not the freedom itself. I'm glad I watched it again.",4.0

"The 1960s saw a lot of social change. The hippie movement, the increased exposure of recreational drugs, and the idea of freedom were all on the rise. Easy Rider captures that time and tries to depict a feeling. For the most part, it succeeds.

Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) star as two bikers who are riding across America on their choppers. We see them buying and selling drugs, and meeting up with other like-minded people. They are determined to leave behind the established system and make their own way in life. In a way, this is a road movie, but it's also much more.

The biggest source of conflict in the movie comes in the form of people who see Wyatt and Billy as dangerous non-conformists. They are arrested on dubious grounds and receive verbal abuse from some of the townspeople they meet along the way.

The story itself is actually pretty thin. This is a movie that is more about the lifestyle than the plot of its characters. The idea of communes and free love are not as shocking as when they first appeared, but imagine watching the ideas portrayed in this movie when it was released.

Jack Nicholson shows up as lawyer George Hanson, who helps out our rebellious heroes when they find themselves locked up in jail. Nicholson's role is brief, but memorable. Hopper and Fonda do a great job of portraying the free-spirited bikers.

Music plays a big part in the movie and helps to establish the 60s feel. Be ready for Hendrix, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Band, Roger McGuinn, and many other performers from the era. The other star is the American scenery. The mountain locations are particularly spectacular.

The movie is dated now, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. I would recommend it for people born in the 50s or before, as well as younger people who are curious about what life might have been like at the end of the 60s.

The Blu-ray presentation from Criterion (in the America Lost and Found set) does a good job of restoring this important movie, and comes with commentaries and a choice of audio options.

"The odyssey of two motorcycle hippies:  Billy (Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt aka Captain America (Peter Fonda) who score it big on a cocaine deal and go on a celebratory ride from L.A. to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  Their names were supposedly based on Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp of Wild West fame. Their adventures take them from farming families to hippie communes, from rural southern towns to their final destination:  Mardi Gras New Orleans. Watch for Jack Nicholson in one of his earliest and most unforgettable performances as George: the boozing, small-town lawyer.  The movie explores the drug counterculture and social intolerance of the late 1960's. The film editing is at times odd but other times, brilliant....which best describes co-writer/director Dennis Hopper's personality.
I saw this on the big screen when I was fourteen.  It marked the beginning of my love for motorcycles (and hippies). Wyatt (Fonda) rides on perhaps the most iconic motorcycle in history: The ""Captain America"" Chopper (a heavily customized Harley-Davidson). The movie has an excellent 60's music soundtrack played alongside beautiful Americana landscapes: it is a biker's dream trip. The pot smoking scenes are perhaps too frequent and sometimes ludicrous. There is also a strange but interesting ""LSD"" scene which attempts to show the psychotic side of a ""trip"".  Dennis Hopper went on to have a fairly successful film career and succumbed to cancer in 2010.  Peter Fonda (Jane's brother and Henry's son) is still working and gave an Oscar nominated performance in 1997's ""Ulee's Gold"".  Jack Nicholson, needless to say, went on to become a film legend.",4.0

"In the recent Associated Press obituary for the late actor and director, Dennis Hooper, is quoted as believing that, for him, the 1969 counter-cultural classic motorcycle film that he directed, ""Easy Rider"", was more a statement about the political landscape of the times than a male-bonding biker ""road"" movie. I agree with him, or at least that is how I have always viewed the film. The subjects of drugs, using and selling, dressing for ""hippie' success, the hard road of rural communal living (or urban communal living, for that matter), and trying to cope with the ""squares"" and ""rednecks"" were all in a day's work back in the days for those of us committed to ""seeking a newer world."".

In that sense ""Easy Rider"" is a very, very different road trip from that of the literary one in Jack Kerouac's 1957 ""On The Road"" (although the ""action"" of that book actually took place in the late 1940s). That small generational difference in time probably in cultural time was a matter of different epochs. The action of ""On The Road"" speaks to an almost subterranean escape from the bleakness of American conformity in the immediate post-World War II period behind the backs of the squares. The bikers, Fonda and Hopper (Wyatt and Billy, alright), in ""Easy Rider"" are up front and public, as reflected the change in mores of their times, about their ""making and doing"" as they confronted their version of American conformity in the 1960s. In the end they lost that public battle, and we have been fighting a rearguard series of ""culture wars"" battles ever since. But watch this film to get a slice of 1960s Americana. And if you are too young to know some of the references just ask mother and father (or the grandparents, ouch!). They WILL know.

Note: The late Doctor Gonzo"", journalist Hunter Thompson, rather eloquently in HIS countercultural classic, ""Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas"", mentioned toward the end of that fearsome saga that sometime in the late 1960s he could almost see the high tide of the movement ebbing before his eyes signaling the end of all those fierce dreams that we had of that ""newer world"" and the beginning of the approach of the ""night of the long knives."" ""Easy Rider"" is the cinematic take on that proposition",4.0

The movie making itself might seem dated, but the impulse behind this film is real in a way that 10 Fast and Furious sequels cant match. And this movie will always be a snapshot of rebellion; from the real life pot smoking done on camera throughout the movie, to an acid tripping Peter Fonda hating his mother out loud in the graveyard sequence (his real mother took her own life when he was a boy.) Theres plenty to be critical about in easy rider from a technical standpoint, but as a low budget attempt at capturing a larger cultural mood of rebellion at that moment, it does quite well.

But few such films prove potent enough to retain the favor of audiences in perpetuity. 35 years after the film's release, audiences around the world are still captivated by the raw vision of Easy Rider is no small accomplishment. To this day, the image of Fonda and Hopper (neither of whom knew how to ride a motorcycle before making this film) careening helmetless down the open highway to the tune of Steppenwolf's ""Born to be Wild"" defines the American biker motif more clearly than any Hell's Angel could ever hope to."" Bart Zeigler

37 years after 'Easy Rider' was first shown, I viewed the movie again. I was prepared to think I remembered the story, the story of an American myth, with anitheroes riding from the West only this time on bikes into the evil of middle America. I thought the best thing about the film was the soundtrack. It was an important film but not a very good one. Then I watched it, and I was hooked from scene one. The film drew me in, such a very good film. Not perfect but very good. Dennis Hopper's character,was so real, the dishelveled, long-haired. I remember many people who dressed and acted just like him. He directed the film and gave the character's names Wyatt and Billy, old west names discovering new territory. The acting was natural, not self-conciuous. It covers alot of territory in 90 plus minutes. The landscapes so beautiful and unspoiled. The surprises were the fact that Phil Spectre was cast as the connection- how trite and real is that? The early scene with the rancher and his family was one of the beautiful scenes of the film. Wyatt tells the rancher: ""It's not everyman who can live off the land, you know, doing his own thing his own time. You should be proud.""

The film comes alive when George, played by Jack Nicholsen as an ACLU lawyer. What a handsome dude, a purveyor of many roles to come. I remembered wondering about his character and thinking his Southern accent was too much and his football helmet silly. Now I understand about the football helmet and George's speech about how America used to be ""a helluva good country"". That night around the campfire, he samples grass for the first time, ""Lord have mercy, is that what that is?"" But best of all, is Peter Fonda and the quiet, intelligent, Captain America/Wyatt. He moves through the movie with, as my best friend would say, a noblesse oblige, a retired drug pusher who casts away his past and his allegiance to time with his wristwatch. Captain America and Billy find the whorehouse George directed them to and drop acid in the cemetery with two hookers, Karen Black in a great role. It is a long acid trip that sets the standard for hallucination portrayals for years to come. It's a bad trip, but maybe they chose the wrong place with the wrong people. And all is not well in the land of the free. A brief run-in with a few local yokels leads to their undoing. I'd thought Easy Rider would seem dated. Turns out it's timeless.

Easy Rider is a lengthy music video for the '60s culture. But it is also an honest perspective on the counterculture movement. Fonda and Hopper's portrayal of that experience is free of the romanticized tone that characterizes so many other films from this era. Fonda's dialogue the night before his death is a purveyor of things to come. Hopper is happy because they've made it to their destination with their drug money. ""We blew it,"" Fonda tells him. ""We blew it, man."" Heavy.

""Easy Rider is the late 1960s ""road film"" tale of a search for freedom (or the illusion of freedom) in a conformist and corrupt America, in the midst of paranoia, bigotry and violence. Released in the year of the Woodstock concert, and made in a year of two tragic assassinations (Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King), the Vietnam War buildup and Nixon's election, the tone of this 'alternative' film is remarkably downbeat and bleak, reflecting the collapse of the idealistic 60s. Easy Rider, one of the first films of its kind, was a ritualistic experience and viewed (often repeatedly) by youthful audiences in the late 1960s as a reflection of their hopes of liberation and fears of the Establishment.""

"This review is for the 1999 (40th Anniversary Edition) Columbia DVD.

The movie in a nutshell involves two hippies, Wyatt (Peter Fonda) also known as ""Captain America"" and Billy (Dennis Hopper), who score a huge cocaine deal in Mexico and unload it on a rich guy (Phil Spector) in California.  The two then decide to travel by motorcycle to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans to have a great time.  This sets up the rest of the film for many offbeat and bizarre encounters on this free-spirited road trip.

I was only ten years old when 'Easy Rider' came out, and without even seeing it, I can recall how popular the movie was.  In fact, it was very common to see a large black & white poster of Peter Fonda on his chrome chopper, with the helmet and gas tank colorized in florescent red, white and blue.  For the counterculture/anti-establishment crowd, it would seem that traveling cross country on a Harley with a stash of money, drugs along with easy sexual encounters was the new American dream.  It wasn't until recently I had the chance to watch this film in its entirety on DVD, and the sense of free-spirited travel across scenic landscapes holds up well and so does a lot of the music, especially songs like ""Born to be Wild"" and several of the songs by the Byrds.  In addition, the movie has some great moments including just about every scene that features Jack Nicholson.  But sadly, communal living, acid trips, getting high on pot, having unprotected sex with prostitutes and dealing drugs for money just dates this film miserably.  All of this wouldn't be necessarily bad especially if it was a bust-your-gut comedy, but unfortunately the film idealizes this lifestyle and plays too heavy-handed against their stereotypical Southern oppressors - especially in the final scene.  Overall, I did like this movie for the cinemetography, music and nostalgia, but wasn't at all sold on the manipulative and outdated message.  However, it's definitely one of these movies like Woodstock, that brings insight, be it good or bad, into the hippie counter-culter of the late 1960's.

The DVD picture quality is great.  I can only recall seeing roughly four or five tiny specs of film deterioration during the entire film.  The colors and sharpness are fantastic and the stereo sound is excellent too.  The making of the movie bonus feature is very insightful as a lot of details about the motorcycles, the production and background of the film are brought to light.  Dennis Hopper also gives audio commentary for the main feature.

"Where Easy Rider is concerned, what can be said that hasn't already been said - it is both a metaphor and a history of its time... and of today, if you're still part vagabond and spend any real time in the saddle - poseurs need not apply, this movie isn't about them.

The superb music sounds like a replay of AM radio of that era, and the scenes still bring a hunger and longing of wanderlust and desire to crank up the bike.  The acting is, of course, what it is - a tad contrived in spots, artful in others, but comes together in mildly appalling reminiscences of those smoky campfire scenes of yore - how did we ever survive those years!

Although the couch potatoes often think so, the movie ending hostility and brutality wasn't all that contrived, and I can vividly recall being bodily run out of a much needed gas-stop in rural Mississippi back then, just for the crime of showing up on a bike wearing leather (it was November...) -- and even today, not every motel looks kindly on bikes unless they're of the Tupperware barge variety.  Never mind that Easy Rider starts with a drug buy, we were pretty naive back then, the general peaceful wandering of the two says as much about the era, and those of us who were too wiped out to truly remember the 60's, as, say, Star Trek says about the social issues we attempted to wrestle with...

Not real history, but well worth the time, even if it really isn't much of a motorcycle movie...",4.0
"The concept of this movie is simple! Is about this two homeless rebel riders that travel around USA to meet people and getting ""high"" with them.

There isn't to much naughty words but the drug use is FREQUENTLY and the 60's soundtrack like hard rock and country music is also frequently. This movie can be known as a hippie movie than a motorcycle movie.

The bad things were: NO action, NO high speed and a uncool ending.

P.S: If you are a 60's fan then you should also buy Midnight Cowboy and the Woodstock concert so you can have three movies including this one that represent it's time in a very COOL way!

I lapped up every minute of Easy Rider, of course there is very little plot, but that is not the reason you watch it.  The stylised late sixties 'acid induced' camera work, fabulous sound track and wonderful male leads is a testament that even when people are doped to the eye balls some stories are begging to be told.  This film was so of its time - almost like the foretelling of the autumn and winter of the 'Summer of Love' when the warm fluffy ideaologies where crumbling and decaying and the establishment where again ascertaining their will.

Dennis Hopper is so wonderful in this he holds the screen.  His maniac/OCD behaviour is a foretaste of many of the great characters he portrayed in the 70's, but also a stern reminder of his own personal descent, that thankfully now he has overcome.  Of course like many films of this time and even now the females are just window dressing.  It does frustrate me a bit because I like many of my contemporaries imagine myself on a big Harley cruising through the landscape, any way 'the times they are a changing' and some day I hope we will see more strong, sassy and beautiful women on the screen.",4.0

"_Easy Rider_ is, of course, one of the most important pioneer independent films of the 1960s film movement.  It is the classic biker flick: two guys traveling across the Southwest United States searching for themselves and this country.  Thus, I have a hesitant recommendation.  Few other films that I have seen capture this time period with such accuracy, vision, and emotional power.  However, if you're not into ""road trip"" movies of the 1960s and 1970s, you might be bored by the film's spontaneous dialogue and long visual riding sequences set to great music.

This film reminded me, in many ways, of the movie _Vanishing Point_, most likely because that film came out two years after _Easy Rider_.  Both depict a lost generation, endlessly searching for something that isn't there, only to be sacrificed for their journey.  The acting in this film is terrific and the meaninglessness of the film's ending is heartbreaking for those audience members who desperately seek to find the same thing that these two free spirits are searching for.

I found the ""Making of"" featurette on this DVD edition to be very informative and really well done.  In fact, it is one of the better featurettes I have seen.  Hopper and Fonda (among others) take us behind the scenes into the magical making of this film and how it all just seemed to flow naturally, largely unscripted.  A word to the wise: you might want to check out the 35th anniversary edition.  While I have heard that the quality of the DVD is not improved, there is a soundtrack CD and a nice booklet for any true fan of the film.  Otherwise, you'll do just fine with this cheaper version.",4.0
"Well, I hadn't seen this movie in ~20 years, never owned the video OR an earlier DVD, so it was worth purchasing. But I WAS disappointed in the ""song-track"" (as a previous reviewer so aptly put it), why wasn't the other music from the movie, and especially ""Ballad of Easy Rider"" (a personal favorite) included? And the book is a little dry for my liking - focused too much on the film-industry aspects and not enough on the times that generated the movie and what it meant to all of us who lived (even partially) during those times.
On the positive side, I'd never seen the documentary about the making of the film, and it was affirming to learn that most of the actors really were stoned out of their minds while they were making the movie...one always wonders about these things.
Overall, I'm happy to have finally added this to my collection, and to be able to share it with all my similar-generation friends.",4.0

"This was a re-visit # 3 for me viewing 'Steel Magnolias', where women were women and men were not as good. Louisiana in the 1980's, the good old days  when young women died from the complications of diabetes and kidney disease.

Dolly Parton owns the local beauty shoppe, where anyone and everyone in the know has their hair done, and all the troubles of the town are taken into account. The young bride-to-be , Selby, played by Julia Roberts, comes here with her mother, Sally Field, to have their hair done. The new hairdresser,played by Daryl Hannah,plies her trade and wins them over. The rich and mean woman of the town, played by Shirley MacLaine, comes to visit and leave her pearls of wisdom. Olympia Dukakis, whose character has lost her husband, has the real wisdom in they town.

These six Southern women are the steel magnolias of the town. Beautiful on the outside, most of them, with steel spines on the inside. But, then, aren't most women like that?

The film is characterized as a woman's chick flick, but that is wrong. This is a film for everyone, and gives us a chance to cry a little. This is a film for entertainment,to sweep us away from our troubles and to concentrate on the troubles of others.

"By the mid-60s, the traditional movie audience had changed from a middle-aged, high school-educated, middle-to lower-class viewing group to a younger, college-educated, more affluent, middle-class audience. This is the movie that revolutionized and redirected the industry by proving that phenomenal returns could be made from a modest investment, if it appealed to its new audience, as well as launching an interest in producing youth-cult pictures. At a glance, Easy Rider appears to be and has the charm of a cheaply made underground flick seeking to exploit the iridescent youth movement. Well it was cheaply made, as far as money goes, costing a meek $350,000, but it returned $60 million worldwide. It was the first independent film to be distributed by a major company, Columbia, and it remains one of the most vital additions to film history because it best articulated the angst and energies of this alienated mass we call the counter-culture.

Directed by Dennis Hopper, produced by Peter Fonda, and starring both as two shaggy haired, reefer-reveling vagabonds inhaling the southwestern countryside atop their motorcycles, an excursion financed by an earlier cocaine deal, the movie is fueled by a caustic, equally rebellious soundtrack. Indeed, the first half hour seems more like a continuous rock video, commenced by the ultimate road song, Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild. They leave L.A., headed for Mardi Gras, and pass through various towns, a hippie commune, and the boundless, sun drenched American landscape, but also through areas where local residents are increasingly narrow-minded and hateful of their longhaired freedom and use of drugs. Watch as Fonda casts away his wristwatch in the beginning, a symbol of an inner escape from the constraints and complexities of modern living. The title also points to our anti-heroes' rootless natures, who's capricious decision to discover their world directs them to the road's infinite freedom.

 There's an interesting distinction to be made between Fonda's and Hopper's characters. Fonda plays the cool and introspective ""Captain America"" Wyatt astraddle a gleaming, low-riding bike with a 'stars-and-stripes' tear-drop gas tank, clad in tight leather pants and a black leather jacket with an American flag emblazoned on the back. Fonda said he actually soaked in a tub while wearing these pants, striding around in them afterwards until they had dried to give them the worn appearance. Hopper is the mustached, longhaired Billy, with a tan-colored bush hat, fringed buckskin jacket, and an Indian necklace of animals' teeth. Their names refer, of course, to the Western legends of Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid, and this is indicative of their personalities. Wyatt is quiet, more mature, and content with any surrounding; the jive-spouting Billy is restless and easily irritated. It's easy to imagine these drifters instead as idealistic gunslingers trotting across the immortal, sun-dried West, seeking out the untarnished American Dream in a corrupt, conformist environment. A quote from the coarsely brilliant George Carlin comes to mind, who wrote ""The reason they call it the American Dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it."" As our exploration of the great civilization deepens into the bowels of the bigoted paranoia of the South, this becomes increasingly manifest.

Relish also Jack Nicholson in the performance that made him a star. After a decade or so of anonymity, he was contemplating giving acting up - lucky for him, and us, he did not. Playing the part of the jovial, rustic, and alcoholic lawyer, George Hanson, a part originally intended for Rip Torn, our hippie friends discover him in a jail after a night of obvious, though unstated, inebriation. He joins Wyatt and Billy on their quest and is bludgeoned to death one night as they camp in a forest on the outskirts of a terribly prejudiced, volatile Southern town. Think about what this represents: George, while he shares their longing for escape, is the least like Wyatt and Billy - he doesn't dress like them, doesn't speak their lingo, and doesn't have a shaggy mane. Even his addiction to alcohol seems to separate him even further from this equation - grass was a substance whose popularity belonged to the youth; alcohol was a more ancient addiction. So in him, we have a combination of both liberal and conservative values, in whose death the distinction between those dedicated to the rebellion (Wyatt and Billy) and those who're only innocent concomitants (George) diminishes. The locals are sort of killing a native son. Pay attention to what George tells Billy in campfire palaver:
  ""They're scared of what you represent to 'em (freedom)... But talkin' about it and bein' it - that's two different things. I mean, it's real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. 'Course, don't ever tell anybody that they're not free 'cause then they're gonna get real busy killin' and maimin' to prove to you that they are. Oh yeah, they're gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you about individual freedom, but they see a free individual, it's gonna scare 'em.""
Really, a fascinating picture. Once you get through Hopper's esoteric directorial methods and the rambling, improvisational nature of the script, I think its greater message will truly affect your viscera.",4.0
"This is an enormously famous movie, one that has achieved iconic status.  That means it's great, right?  Well, not necessarily.  It's an incredibly amateurish and uneven flick, with gaping holes in the plot, in the dialog, in the editing.  The performances are (quite literally) stoned and dazed.  But in this birds nest of oddness there are enough true gems to put it firmly in the forefront of classic cinema.  These are the scenes we've all seen before: the famous ""This used to be a hell of a good country"" scene at the campfire comes to mind.  That soliloquy alone is worth the price of the DVD.  I think it all boils down to the fact that there is basically nothing worth getting too sentimental about from this time period.  The crazy crack pot adolescence of the American nation doesn't bear too much scrutiny or it becomes painfully obvious that if you weren't stoned, you didn't get it, and you won't get it now.  In other words, you have to believe it to see it.  I do believe some of it, sometimes, and this movie helps me glimpse that small part.  But it also shows me how painfully vaccuous and dreary and empty and pointless so much of the youth counterculture truly was.
 Any way, good flick, and it rings with an historical authenticity that is almost unequaled.  Its great contribution is that it was made at the peak of the era, and commented on that era very eloquently.  Usually the good commentary doesn't come along for many years, but Easy Rider pretty much hits the nail on the head.  Plus the bikes are great.
 I highly recommend a very similar film called ""Vanishing Point"", which is a better film, and another dose of very authentic and high-proof 60's/70's nihilism.  It ends just as happily, too.",4.0

"EASY RIDER is a fairly entertaining relic from the counterculture of the sixties. The fingerprints of Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are all over it. Fonda is the producer and Hopper is the director. In addition, the screenplay is the result of the collaboration of Terry Southern with both of them.
The story is about two free spirits (Fonda and Hopper) on a motorcycle trip from Los Angeles to New Orleans. Along the way they hook up with a drunk (Jack Nicholson) whose performance provides some of the most memorable scenes in the movie.
The main competition for awards in 1969 came from MIDNIGHT COWBOY, TRUE GRIT and THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE. In spite of the tough field, EASY RIDER was still able to win nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson), Original Story and Screenplay.",4.0
"Loved this flick, got it for a girls' dorm and it's checked out all the time. Movie nights galore with this one.",4.0
"There really isn't any big mystery as to why EASY RIDER was such a massive hit when it was released in 1969.  On a budget of no more than half a million dollars, the director/producer team of Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda somehow captured the alienation that a lot of young people felt about America during that turbulent time.
Hopper and Fonda are, respectively, Billy and Wyatt, two Harley Davidson-riding hippie bikers who, after making a big drug score with a big-time dope dealer (played by record mogul Phil Spector), embark on a journey across America, ostensibly to enjoy a good time in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.  Along the way, they encounter, initially, the more idealistic side of America in a New Mexico hippie commune and a farm in Arizona.  But when they get into Texas, their joining a parade illegally gets them tossed into a redneck jail.  Not long after, though, they are bailed out by a very inebriated lawyer by the name of George Hanson (Jack Nicholson, in the role that made him a household word in Hollywood).
Nicholson cheerfully agrees to go along with them on their Harley sojourn.  Along the way, Hopper complains to him about how he and Fonda are constantly harrassed by the law and unable to get even a ""second rate motel"" to sleep in.  Nicholson gingerly explains to the pair that it's not just the length of the hair that bothers people; it's what they represent--individual freedom: ""They'll talk to you and talk to you about freedom, but when they see someone with real freedom, it's gonna scare them.""  One night, Louisiana rednecks savagely beat and kill Nicholson.  It is at this point that EASY RIDER starts getting bleaker in tone.
Fonda and Hopper arrive in New Orleans at the height of Mardi Gras, and cavort around an Orleans cemetary with two hookers (Toni Basil, Karen Black) during an acid trip.  But dismayed by what they've seen, they beat a hasty retreat and continue east.  Fonda realizes the futility of their journey now.  He tells Hopper, ""We blew it.""  Their journey comes to an end on a Florida highway when Hopper flicks off two rednecks in a truck, who then proceed to blow both him and Fonda off the road.
Unquestionably dated to a large extent, particularly in the strange editing of certain sequences and the acid trip, which looks less avant garde and more amateurish, EASY RIDER nevertheless has its merits.  The soundtrack is one of those merits, with 1960s classics like Steppenwolf's ""Born To Be Wild"" and the Band's ""The Weight"", and countryish tracks like ""Wasn't Born To Follow"" (the Byrds) and ""Don't Bogart Me"" (Fraternity of Man).  The other is, of course, Nicholson's star-making performance as George Hanson.  Before this, Nicholson was just a B-grade actor.  But his often-uproarious and, later, thoughtful performance here cemented his reputation as a top-notch movie star forever.
Featuring very fine cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs, who later went on to do portions of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, EASY RIDER is a flawed film by today's standards, but in its day was a groundbreaking film that helped change Hollywood forever.  If one can get by its being highly dated, it still works as a period piece.",4.0
"Dennis Hopper has always struck me as a living relic of the sixties. A counter-culture rebel who never could quite come to terms with the Vietnam era government he so distrusted. Not surprisingly, his portrayal of ""Billy"", the frantic companion to Peter Fonda's ""Wyatt"" is the constantly racing heart of Easy Rider, one of the most important films of the late sixties.
Filmed the year after the summer of love had ended, Rider is one of the few true portraits of the cultural landscape of that turbulent era. The mellow Fonda always represents a generations quest for a simple kind of peace while Hopper, who also directed, is the fatal drive towards a futile end, always pulling away from the obvious path. They ride their custom choppers like two cowboys headed through the wild west. It's an obvious analogy but a meaningful one, their dangers were no less great as we find out. Although a notoriously frazzled production, great performances (notably Jack Nicholson), and a supurb use of some of the great rock road anthems of the day help create something fascinating, if quite dated. Of course, whether you lived the era or not, today the movie stands as a great historical representation of the mood of a country during one of America's strangest periods. Hopper's direction seems subdued by contrast to his performance (outside of a depressing and sureal trip and acid trip through Mardi Gras and a rather blunt ending) although perhaps less so considering his admitted, much longer initial cut, before leveler heads prevailed. There is an obvious fly by night amateurish quality overall but It's still a good film, maybe even great in certain ways. Cultural sign posts like this are rare. Rarer still to be made by the ones who lived it.",4.0
"This movie still surprises even today.  Though it is dated, it gives a fascinating portrayal of two hippies rolling throguh America at a time of social change.  Mostly scenes and intricate editing, we see a portrait of two bikers who search for freedom.  For me, the delight is seeing Jack Nicholson in one of his absolute best performances.  He steals every scene he is in.  However, it is a bit slow and it is not quite a epochal classic like Rebel Without a Cause.  It still evokes a sense of freedom and a sense of America.",4.0
"This is a true classic.  The movie starts so slowly that I was afraid I was going to drop off to sleep.  The commune breaks things up a bit, but the fun only really starts when Jack Nicholson joins the club.  Truly, Nicholson is one of the greatest actors ever.  From Terms of Endearment to Batman, Nicholson makes almost any movie worth watching.  Same here.
Many scenes are laugh out loud funny.  I was rolling on the floor laughing during the exchage about aliens.  The drug trips are interesting.  The music is a huge part of the culture and so it is in the movie.
To tell more would be to ruin the greaetest moments in the film.  It is worth watching.  I should say that there is some nudity, but no language if you are interested.",4.0
"When ""Easy Rider"" was released in 1969, it marked a turning point in the history of the American cinema. It took the independent film movement--practiced for so long by Roger Corman and others--and thrust it forward into the spotlight and, eventually, the mainstream. Made for under a million dollars, ""Easy Rider"" eventually grossed close to fifty, and opened Hollywood's eyes to a whole new area of potential profits. The American film was never to be the same again.
The story is a simple one: two hippies (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) riding their motorcycles cross-country to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Along the way they visit a commune, meet some girls, go to a whorehouse, and do lots and lots of drugs. They also get thrown in jail where they meet an alcoholic lawyer, terrifically played by Jack Nicholson in his breakthrough role. The trio then continues on together towards New Orleans, stopping occasionally to smoke some grass and philosophize about life. Eventually, they have a series of strange and violent conflicts with some rednecks that lead to the movie's rather abrupt conclusion.
The best aspects of the film are the on-target performances and Laszlo Kovacs' stark cinematography. Also of note is a stunning, hallucinatory montage of an acid trip, complete with a bizarre Catholic motif. The writing (by Fonda, Hopper, and Terry Southern) is strictly ordinary, providing only the barest structure to hang the story on, punctuated by mostly improvised dialog.
What made ""Easy Rider"" different from the ordinary Hollywood films of its time was its rebellious spirit and youthful exuberance, complemented by its loud hippie rock soundtrack. Directed by Hopper and produced by Fonda, ""Easy Rider"" was the first movie of its kind to reach such a wide audience and gain mainstream acceptance. Its casual portrayal of drug use and confrontational defiance of authority combined to make ""Easy Rider"" an anthem for young people. Although the film today seems inevitably dated, it still stands as an enduring emblem of its age.",4.0

"A group of small town southern women provide valuable insights into the strength of women in traditional settings. It sounds corny and hopelessly mundane, but somehow they make it work. Having a fabulous cast can't hurt.

Sally Field plays M'Lynn Eatenton, whose daughter Shelby (Julia Roberts) is getting married as the movie opens. Their friend and hairdresser Truvy Jones is played by Dolly Parton. Doesn't Dolly seem like the perfect small town hairdresser? Shirley MacLaine is the funniest character as Ouiser Boudreaux, the dog owner in permanent war with M'Lynn's husband Drum (Tom Skerritt). Ouiser has the best line in the film: ""I'm not crazy, I've just been in a very bad mood for forty years.""

Daryl Hannah somehow manages to look positively dowdy as Annelle, Truvy's new assistant who starts out like a whipped puppy, then goes pretty wild after her worthless boyfriend is sent to state prison for a long term. Finally, she gets religion and prays all the time. Still, she marries and has a baby at the end of the film. Or just after: the ending is rushing her off to the hospital because her water broke during a picnic.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because these girls are captivating and they can act even if a lot of this seems a bit stagey! There are also several powerful scenes in this film.

The men in this movie are mere pawns and are there only to move the film along to it's predicable and manipulative ending.

"An extremely episodic story of several smalltown southern women whose social lives revolve around meetings in the local beauty parlor, STEEL MAGNOLIAS' script and performances are dogged by an aura of artificiality--but it scarcely matters, for the film is a tremendous amount of fun.
Some of the performances are more successful than others, with Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Julia Roberts, and Darryl Hannah coming out on top (I am greatly surprised that so many other reviewers dislike Hannah's performance, which seems to me considerably less artificial than many others--but perhaps since I'm actually Southern I have a different perspective); Sally Fields and Dolly Parton are less successful, but not in any sense that actually distracts from the fun.  Perhaps most surprising in a film which focuses on women are the brief but impressive performances from the male supporting cast, which includes effective performances by Tom Skerrit, Sam Shepherd, and Dylan McDermott, and which serve to ground the film with a sense of the broader community in which the women live.
The script abounds in zinging one-liners (""If you can't say something nice, come sit by me!"") and often hilarious situations (imagine Olympia Dukakis surrounded by naked men in the highschool football team's locker room); it also contains some very touching segments sure to choke up all but the most heartless viewer. And although the story is extremely manipulative and rather predictable, those factors don't actually get in the way of its effectiveness.  While probably not a ""great film"" by any serious standard, it is tremendously good-natured, well-intended, and extremely entertaining, and most people will find that it lingers pleasantly in mind and holds up well under repeated viewings.",4.0
"What's this?!. A young man giving a rave review for a tear inducing, 'chick flick' movie that'll leave you going through a box of tissues?!. Yes. The fact is that ""Steel Magnolias"" is a very good, nice film. Have we seen it before?. Yes. ""Terms Of Endearment"", a better movie, comes immediatley to mind. This movie works because of the cast : Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Tom Skerritt, and Dylan McDermott. These people give some of the best performances of their careers. The plot centers around a group of southern women who share each other's business while going to a local beauty shop. Another storyline includes Sally Fields' daughter(Roberts)getting married. If you haven't seen this movie, then that's all I'll say. Field gives a great performance. Her outburst scene towards the end is a real stand out. However, MacLaine steals every frame she's in as a sharp tongued southerner. Julia Roberts shines here too. Director Herbert Ross has a nice eye for detail. The film looks sharp. The movie has a fair share of intelligent comedy and drama. Just enough for everyone. So, come on guys!. The whole 'chick flick' title is old. Enjoy movies!. This is a nicely made movie.",4.0
"A pleasant mix of comedy and tear-jerking drama, Steel Magnolias is a heartwarming movie with a strong message, no matter what happens life goes on and the strong can survive almost anything. This movie takes place 1980s Louisiana and features a small town gaggle of women who congregate at Truvy's Beauty Spot to laugh, cry gossip and generally experience life. Each women has their own strong personality and brings something unique to the film.  Steel Magnolias is adapted from the play of the same name by Robert Harling. The movie flashes through several milestones in the lives of six women. M'lynn Eatenton played by Sally Field is the mother of Shelby Eatenton (Julia Roberts). And the two seem to be the main focus of the movie. Strong M'lynn and caring but naive Shelby make the perfect mother-daughter team. The movie begins with the wedding day of Shelby, and after a nail polish crisis the two head to Truvy's beauty parlor to gossip and laugh. Dolly Parton plays a caring and hopelessly romantic ""southern belle,"" named Truvy Jones; who is constantly trying to elicit some romance from her husband, Spud (Sam Shepard).  Providing a scapegoat of sorts is nervous newcomer, Annelle (Daryl Hannah) who soon finds out the gossipy nature of the group when she announces she ""isn't sure"" if she is married or not.  And of course, no clique would be complete without the sarcastic pessimist. Shirley MacClaine slips artfully into the role of Ouiser Boudreaux. The rich seemingly nasty woman who is rarely seen without a floppy straw hat and a huge slobbering dog.  Providing the perfect compliment to Ouisers acrid personality is best friend Clariee (Olympia Dukasis). Miss Clairee is always ready with gossip or a playful insult of Ouiser. Ouiser, Truvy and Clairee are the main suppliers of the quirky, well timed one-liners that add spice to the movie as a whole.  Being a real ""chick flick"" Steel Magnolias contains a few, underdeveloped male characters who are regarded more as scenery than actual characters. Drum Eatenton, played by Tom Skerritt is M'lynns husband who spends half of his screen time shooting pigeons from trees and the other half grinning blankly or snarling at Ouiser. Shelby's husband, Jackson Latcherie (Dylan McDermott) is upstaged in most of his scenes and then forgotten about completely. Annelle's boyfriend, Sammy Desoto (Kevin J. O'Connor) really only has one poorly executed, pointless scene before he too is forgotten; only to reappear at the end wearing a bunny suit. And who could forget Truvy's Husband Spud, probably everyone as his few scenes involve him reclining on a bed, drinking beer, watching television and being grumpy.  Despite the appearance that these women are dippy southern women, several tragedies call them all to action, where each shows they are more than meets the eye. The character and will of the six is gradually introduced as the viewer moves from one milestone to another. The true acting brilliance of Sally Field is presented in one poignant scene, where M'lynn, hysterically asks God why. The captivating tear-jerking scene complete with Fields signature locked jaw distant eyes is broken only by a lame attempt at comedic relief. In which M'lynn switches from pissed to amused in a matter of seconds. With one motion the scene goes from classically emotional to pathetic and back again.  Steel Magnolias is quite possibly the funniest movie that will also make you cry. These six witty southern belles show their strength and character time and again, proving they are true Steel Magnolias.  Steel Magnolias was directed by Herbert Ross, written by Robert Harling is a  TriStar Pictures production. Steel Magnolias received a 1990 Oscar nomination for Julia Roberts as best supporting actress and a 1990 Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture-Sally Field. And in 1990 Julia Roberts won a Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her work in Steel Magnolias. With an award like 1990s Peoples Choice Awards-Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture is it any wonder that Steel Magnolias comes highly recommended.",4.0
"The first time that I saw this, I really thought that Shelby (Julia Roberts) was a spoiled and inconsiderate brat.

"G'day from Australia, when l found out about the ""Collectors Edition"" being released, l couldn't wait to get acopy.

My only free film junket, too, back when I edited a weekly newspaper in Minneapolis. I still remember the party with Spielberg and Melinda Dillon and Terri Garr & the little boy. Anyway, a classic of sci fi. I think it shows its age, but it's still lotsa fun. One caveat, though. This DVD edition is dull and murky looking; doesn't do the film justice. I would get the Blu Ray instead. Gotta be better.",4.0
Enjoyed the movie but a lot has changed since this came out. I heard that it is being refilmed and updated which should be great using today's technology.

"I found that I had forgotten all but a very few scenes since last I saw the movie years back. It is well worth another look for others in the same boat and, certainly for those who have never seen it. It is not, of course, a perfect film, earlier scenes are somewhat too broad in portrayal of the impact on Dreyfuss' imagination as to what such a 'close encounter' might actually entail. Richard Dreyfuss gets solo billing in the brief introductory credits at the beginning of the movie: quite an actor's coup but recognition of the weight put on his performance in sustaining most of the film. Two important female roles are well played  as are a number of other key ones. All in all, still watchable after all these years",4.0

"This is a great classic movie with a good story. It didn't need all the cgi of today's movies. I like the original just fine and all of the bonus features, but don't think it needed 3 different version disks with minimal changes.

They added a very minuscule scene of the spaceship interior. I could have done without it or they could have made it more interesting. I rarely agree that it is better to leave endings or spaceship interiors to the imaginations of the viewers, although I'm not saying every movie always needs either. I just don't sit around long after the movies elaborately imagining what I might see or what an outcome is or sit and draw up my own story, it's their story and ideas.

They discuss the size of the set being the largest of it's time and how they made mbay scenes and how they chose the cast.

"When it first made its theatrical run, I thought Spielberg's offering of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was campy weak sauce.  (After all, I was into the 'Star Wars' craze of the time.)  I mean, come on:  Richard Dreyfuss sculpting on a heap of mashed potatoes in a (futile) attempt to recreate the image of Devil's Tower; earthlings communicating with a highly advanced civilization via. . .muscial notes.  My eye muscles were sore due to the constant rolling of them.  I was (and is) a huge fan of Spielberg's 'Jaws'; with this sci-fi pseudo epic, I had thought the young director badly missed the mark.  There weren't even any Jedi lightsabers, for cryin' out loud.

Now that I'm older (and hopefully wiser) I've come to respect and admire nuance and substance.  Having recently caught this 1977 feature film again (thank you, cable), I was, simply, impressed.  Very impressed.  This story of a sudden onslaught of UFO sightings, and subsequent 'close encounters' of a select few (who then became obsessed wanting to know the answers to unknown questions) is as compelling and believable as it is fascinating and thought-provoking.  Now it makes sense to me how Dreyfuss's character indirectly goes off his rocker and embarks on some really bizarre behaviour.  (The scene depicting him yanking his shrubs out of the ground and hurling them through the windows of his home while his terrified family look on had me in stitches.)  An alien encounter at a rural home where a horrified young mother (Melinda Dillon) watches appliances from her vacuum to her dishwasher come on by themselves--screws from a floor vent magically unscrewing themselves out of the floor--is jarring and indeed frightening.  Spielberg's story then rushes breathlessly to Devil's Tower, Wyoming, where (under the guise of a chemical contamination to empty the local population) swarthy G-men prepare for a very special visitor--and a select few of those who are touched by alien contact enter onstage, too.

And the table is set for the climax; even now, all these years later, I marvel at the special effects.  The image of spacecraft of varying shapes, sizes, and colors is awe-inspiring.  (The munchin-like appearances of the extraterrestrials is kind of lame, but who nitpicks?)  Over the course of this encounter, those who have disappeared over the years come home, and a select few volunteers board the mother ship.  And we witness an exchange of civilizations sans violence and bloodshed--in essence, an exchange that someday may very well happen.  Augmented and enhanced by the core group of Dreyfuss, Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, and Francois Truffaut, Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is a gripping, engrossing tale of otherworldly dimensions.  Beam me aboard.

"This is a review of the Blu-ray version.

Generally, everything looks fine.  The Blu-Ray is a definite 90% improvement, but there are scenes that don't really look much better that the original DVD.

This movie has always been hampered by the highly compressed nature of the audio, especially the score.  Unfortunately, what we have here is no improvement.  You would think that with all of the effort that goes into so-called ""ultimate"" versions, they could have gone in to touch-up some of the film's score.  Case in point, is over the end credits.  Compare what you hear with John Williams recording with the Boston Pops which includes the new material from the Special Edition version.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/By-Request-The-Best-Of-John-Williams-And-The-Boston-Pops-Orchestra/dp/B0000040YP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">By Request: The Best Of John Williams And The Boston Pops Orchestra</a>&nbsp;The difference is stunning.  But, alas...

There is one downside (and I admit that this is probably nit-picking) but Criterion's CAV laserdisc version was so wonderful since one could program (edit) the movie into what I (!) felt was the ultimate version.  With all 3 versions on the Blu-Ray, frankly, I do not find one to be completely satisfying.  If we only had the original version, there would be no issue; nothing to compare, too.  But, with 3 versions, one sees things that could have been improved to make (what I think) is a true ultimate version.  But, again, alas...

I love this movie.  The excitement and sense of wonder has always given me goosebumps.  If you have a Blu-Ray, right now, this is the only version to own.",4.0

"I really liked this Blu Ray disc overall.  I was just disappointed in the audio track in the final scenes.  The visuals were great and very crisp, just what you expect from Blu ray, especially the end scenes with the UFOs.  I was really disappointed in the sound in the final scenes.  I have a dolby 5.1 channel surround sound in my living room.  I was expecting the sound to be off the charts for those 5 famous notes, it wasn't.  My expectation was that when the ""mothership"" plays those sounds you not only heard them but felt them.  I found the sound to be muted, it was disappointing.  But maybe this is the vision that Spielberg had for the film.  Still a great film just disappointed in the sound quality.",4.0
"Lots of extras, the stupid scene where he goes in the spaceship put in an earlier edition is out, very good transfer, sound, nice package.",4.0

"I cannot believe I waited this long to watch this film.  It's exciting, scary, and fun.  The Ultimate Edition packaging and special features are most definitely worth more than Amazon is charging for them...",4.0
"There are all 3 versions included in this offering. The Blu-Ray transfer seems to maybe have been done mostly for the original version. There are places in the Special Edition and Director's cut versions that seem NOT to have been put through the Blu-Ray process... for example, in the darker scenes the graininess seems more evident. When Roy Neary is out at those R/R tracks and is lost and has his Encounter of the 2nd kind, there is quite a lot of graininess going on. Also at the beginning in the sandstorm and for other ""night"" scenes... however, during the rest of the film the picture is really great. So, once again it looks as though the people doing the Blu-Ray transfer AGAIN cut corners and tried to save money by not applying the process to the whole film. - Bottom line, this is a great movie and I think I can overlook the fact it is not perfect and still enjoy all 3 versions. But, the PQ is not pristine nor perfect, just mostly great.",4.0

"This is a great transfer of this film. I may have gotten quirky copy, but I thought I would let folks know. When I watched it with the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack, it became out of sync with the picture starting with the first Richard Dreyfus scene with his family. This was during the ""Theatrical Edition"" version on the disc. Fortunately, this awesome version also includes the DTS HD soundtrack as well. So I just switched over to that audio and had no more problems. Again, I assume this is a fluke, since I have read no other posts about this. I just thought I would let people know about the ""defect"" and the quick fix. Other than that, I highly recommend this Blu Ray. It is an excellent transfer. Some of it can be a little grainy, but it IS 30 years old. The sound is phenomenal! The spaceship scenes really put your subwoofer through its paces.",4.0

"This review is for the Blu-Ray and it was viewed on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player.

I am 33 years old, and must confess that I had never seen this film in its entirety. As I am a huge fan of Alien and similarly themed films, I decided to make this the day to start my journey into this disc set. I watched the original ""Theatrical"" ed, and will update my review as I watch the others. PQ 3.5 and AQ 5. I was a little disappointed in the picture quality, which displays noticable grain. I've seen old films with better PQ.

First, the performance of the lead character was one of the most heartfelt I've ever seen. His desire to explore and be a part of this otherworldly miracle is just stirring. I absolutely loved the score. I think that music and scoring was, perhaps used much more effectively in this time period. The effects, even for an older film, were outstanding and with a little suspension of disbelief-convincing. The space ship at the end is just incredible, as is the return of the other ""abductees"". This is a great story, and masterpiece by Spielberg. Many elements are precursors for modern day Sci-Fi movies, series and themes in our cinematic experience. I am certainly glad to own this set, and look forward to watching the other versions another time, along with the special features.",4.0
the disc,4.0
"The sign of a classic movie is how well it ages and ""Close Encounters ..."" seems to get better over the years and the more times you watch it.  This film has many signs to show that it was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" from the opening sequence to the massive role of music to the whole feel of the movie and yet Spielberg did not simply copy Kubrick's formula but instead took the genre on to another level putting his own stamp on it.  Franchises like The ""X-Files"" and many others have at least been influenced themselves by this film and the special effects are spectacular for the time given there was little if any CGI to the scale of today and yet the visual effects hold up very well even by today's standards.

This one-disc Collector's Edition is also a real treat for fans as it has been restored very, very well for an excellent picture and sound quality.  I watched this in DTS surround and anamorphic video and the impact was fabulous!  I finally did justice to my system as it gave all my speakers a great workout.  I tried to find picture imperfections but in vain.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are no Special Features to speak of and for that you'll need to get the 2-Disc version.  For those who just want a great Director's Cut version of this film and are happy with just the one disc like myself, this is a very good dvd version to get.

Highly recommended!",4.0
"Strange events around the world foreshadow the first contact between mankind and aliens.  Several people who encounter UFOs are psychically imprinted with an impulse to converge on the meeting area, including a worker for the phone company (Richard Dreyfuss) and a mother (Melinda Dillon) searching for her abducted son (Cary Guffey).

I'm not sure which of the three (at least) versions of this film I saw.  I didn't get to see the interior of the ship at the end, but I did see the scene in which Dreyfuss tears up his yard to construct a replica of the mountain in his visions; that may provide a clue to those who are more knowledge about this movie than I.  There may be a superior version of this film out there, but I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  No one can convey that sense of wonder better than Stephen Spielberg at his best.  The story structure is very effective, alternating between the intellectually stimulating narrative of two scientists (Francois Truffaut and Bob Balaban) who are investigating the unusual phenomena and the intense, personal stories of two people who don't understand what is happening to them.  The wonderful finale provides a nice contrast to most science fiction films, which are really teched up action flicks with violent endings.",4.0
"I remember seeing movie when I was 13, and was just floored at the special effects, and the story. Then in 1980, they came out with the ""Special Edition"", the version where they show show the inside of the Mother Ship, and I thought, ""that was total crap!"" Never really looked for the original version, but I remember the S.E. was about the only one out on VHS.

"This is the clearest, sharpest and most colorful transfer to Blu-Ray DVD I have ever watched! This film was made in 1977, prior to the well explored theme of government conspiracies with evil aliens intent on colonizing Earth. Earlier and later sci-fi films (with the exception of E.T.) have generally attributed much less benign motives to space aliens.

Spielberg was able to get his audience to believe in well intentioned aliens interested in making first contact with authorities on Earth. A more difficult film to make interesting to audiences brought up on evil space critters, the film still works and many folks appear to enjoy it. While not one of my favorite films I do enjoy watching the very colorful visual effects.",4.0

is) but if you can just sit back and enjoy the ride you won`t be disappointed. It has alot of funny moments and some terrificly gruesome scenes. It`s like a
mixture of Trick 'r' Treat, Carrie, Evil Dead 2 and Pet Sematary thrown in a blender quite literally. Its really well made with some fun performances. Could`ve been a little longer tho. Very
underrated in my opinion. Give it a shot.",4.0
"Got the special edition blu-ray.  I favor the extended version, my girlfriend favors the theatrical version.
I didn't have a regular DVD of this to compare to, but I gotta say, the sound from this is awesome, really gives your subwoofer a workout.  The picture was fine, too, although not as dramatic as other blu-rays we've seen (only a few so far.)

"If there's anyone out there in Amazonland who also owns this three-disc 30th Anniversary Edition, I'd appreciate knowing if you've experienced the same kind of trouble I've had trying to find the icons in the menus on any of the three discs. No matter whether it's the scene selections, languages, or special features, all I ever get when trying to access them are the colored retangular bars (obviously meant to match the giant colored tones console used at the end of the film to communicate with the ""visitors""). In other words, how do you know what scene, special feature, or chosen language you are watching if there's never any indication of what's been selected on any of the three discs? Unless this was intentional (like attempting to drive a car with its windshield painted black, that just wouldn't make any sense!) this has to be a major flaw in the quality control of this boxed set. Anyone who HAS been able to see the titles of what's selected from the menu who could offer a tip, trick, or even a little sympathy for my bad fortune would be appreciated. I'm now on my third copy and all have been equally as bad, no matter which disc I try! Four stars for content with one deducted from a possible five for said menu troubles.",4.0
"This may be my favorite movie of all time.  OK, it's not perfect, but what is?  It's such a fascinating story.  The transfers look great on my 51"" HDTV, and the sound is fine given the film's age.  Over the years, I have bought a CLV Criterion LD, another version on LD that is a terrible transfer, the standard DVD, and now the Blu-Ray.  I have one complaint.  I don't like any of Spielberg's cuts.  I believe this would be a better movie if EVERY scene was present except the entry into the ship, which is a meaningless light show and which Spielberg was forced to do against his better judgment.  Why not offer a version with all the cuts present and allow the owner to deselect the unwanted ones?  The CAV Criterion LD offered that feature a quarter-century ago but at a $130 premium.  The nature of the cuts is such that the movie should still flow well.  Hence, four stars instead of five.

Is there a fourth version of this film?  When I saw it at the theater in January 1978, I remember seeing the power plant AND the ship-in-the-desert scene AND the Wyoming scene with the future ""Apollo Creed,"" which appear together in none of these versions.  When I bought the Criterion version, I remember being disappointed at not seeing them.  However, Spielberg insists he didn't film the ship-in-the-desert scene until later, so I suppose he knows his own history.

The extras disc is fascinating in that you see actors whose principle work fell to the cutting room floor.  You also get to witness some very bad movie making that fortunately never saw the light of day except here.  Yet, the cut scenes involving Roy in the field before his first contact, bad as they are, make his subsequent firing easier to understand.  Nothing in any version explains why the power company was so eager to fire him.

In any case, buy and enjoy.",4.0
"Hollywood runs 10 years behind. My friends and I were watching for UFOs in 1966. Somehow, Dreyfuss got into the three biggest movies of the 1970s. In Close Encounters, he is obsessed with an image in his mind. It turns out to be Devil's Tower in Wyoming, a vertical monolith created by erosion and the nation's first National Monument. Dreyfuss is drawn to an alien landing. ""The Third Kind"" indicates actual contact with UFOs. The film tries to create a sense of realism. So far, UFO stories have been hoaxes and science fiction. Where does Dreyfuss go with his aliens?",4.0
"There are some great reviews about the film, so let me just talk about the transfer. I bought the special edition dvd a few years ago. It looked good on my LG BH200, but not as good as the blu-ray version. But it's weird, some scenes look absolutely amazing, while others look grainy and over saturated. Still, it is a heck of a lot better than the dvd version. Do I recommend this blu-ray? Yes, but only if you aren't paying full price.",4.0
"This was the first Blu-ray disk I bought and I wanted to be blown away by the differences between this format and DVD.  Although it does look a little better, I wasn't smacked in the face by the antennas on the alien ship when it turns over, nor was I ducking for cover when the spaceships are flying past the people beside the road.  Other Blu-ray disks I've bought since this one have blown me away (like the Planet Earth anthology), so I don't think the discrepancy between my dreams and reality are technology related.

Don't get me wrong, Close Encounters is entertaining no matter how many times you've seen it.  Spielberg is a master storyteller and the special features are very entertaining.  However, if you're going to by one Blu-ray disk to impress your friends and neighbors with 50"" 1080p and surround sound (and maybe your Harmony remote) - this isn't the disk to buy.",4.0

"Great that we get all three versions, but there is no reason for them to be put one to a disk, for three disks in all.  It could have been set up so that all were on one and you chose which version from the main menu.  The different cuts are a smallish part of the whole and could fit on the one disk.  Besides, putting it on three parts also makes for the stand-alone commentary to be spread out over the three disks, which is an odd thing to do.  As to the film, they could have left the special edition go altogether.  The much-heralded ""look"" inside the spaceship is meaningless plotwise, just a fancy light show, and who would have a hollow spaceship anyway?",4.0
"Just thought I would bring a matter to the attention of those interested in this set, especially those who already own it. Though of course each of the three versions of CE3K are offered with the DTS audio option in the languages menu (as was the case with the original DVD release) the set I own returns to the default Dolby Digital 5.1. And it is the case with ALL THREE of the discs. I highlight ""DTS 5.1"", then select play, and trying this numerous times, but is still playing in DD 5.1. Just in case, to check to see whether if it is my Pioneer DVD player that is acting up, I tried several other DVDs (including the above-mentioned first DVD release of CE3K) and they are accepting the selection. So my question to any owners of this set would be: Does anyone else experience this, or might I regard this as just a isolated defect for the set I own? I do plan to exchange the set to see if another one would have this same issue. Though I feel the DD 5.1 quite adequate in most instances, I do find (to my ears at least) that the DTS audio is often more rich and has a more seamless surround perspective. Regardless of one's preference, I want of course what I pay for in any product, per the advertisement.

Anyone else encounter this problem? Feedback on this issue will be greatly appreciated from fellow CE3K enthusiasts.

As an aside--I do prefer the original theatrical version as the best of the three offered, but it's neat to have all three available, and the poster diagram included (reverse of the great theater poster) is useful to refer to at, at least initially to sort out the cuts and additions.",4.0

"""Idle Hands"" stars a slew of Hollywood A listers. Devon Sawa, Jessica Alba, Seth Green, and Vivica A. Fox lead this ensemble to save the world from evil. When Anton (Sawa) loses control of his hand to the devil because of his lazy, idle ways, all hell breaks loose. Murder after murder, the hand knocks off suburban inhabitants in creative ways. Raunchy, cornball comedy peppers the horror throughout the movie. Not too bad for what it is, but not family friendly.",4.0
"This is a very odd but very amusing movie about teens and what they do in their spare time. And yes Idle Hands will make you laugh. Seth Green and Jessica Alba headline the cast.

"Obviously Close Encounters is a classic. If you're in to UFOs and Aliens, like great science fiction or are just a fan of Steven Spielberg, then this DVD should absolutely be in your collection.

However, I was a bit dissapointed with the 'making of' in the special features, I'm pretty sure it's been updated with this aniversary release. They've redone interviews with the actors and Director now, replacing the interviews done closer to the time, it seems slicker and has less information. I definitely remember the original 'making of' Doco being wayyyy better. I could be wrong, but you might be better off traking down the original on VHS or the original DVD release.

I found the same problem with the Jaws aniversary edition 'making of' and ET with it's adding of digital effects to the ET puppet and the adding of a redundant scene.",4.0
"This is one of those movies which my mother had to practically tie me to a chair to get me to watch it. I am glad she did.

This movie is one of my all time favorites becuase I have this thought running around which says 'it could have/could be happening'. This possibility and the gentle emotion throughout makes me on the edge of my seat even after my fifth or sixth time watching.

I can't watch it every day like I can with some movies but I do watch it about once every two years or so. This is a classic up there with Batteries not Included and I really wish there was a sequal.

The only thing which I wonder about is: Is Taken a follow on from this movie? It sure seems like it.

Otherwise I have no complaints and love the funny obsessions and determination of the main charaters to see for themselves. You can really imagine it happening that's why I love it.",4.0

"Spielberg's vision of the outerworld is brilliant and captavating. The film is long, but it demands attention. Stephen wrote this and directed it. Dreyfuss is good, but a little to strong in his character. Melinda Dillon as the single mother who loses her son to the aliens is brilliant, so is Teri Garr. This film makes you think, can the government actually pull this off?...After seeing this, I believe it. The DTS version is incredible, the scene where Barry,(little boy), is abducted, is just out right crazy and loud.
  Dreyfuss,(a man on a mission), has had a close encounter, is out to find out where and why. Believe me, if this was you, you would have sleepless nights. Dialogue is good, FX, is incredible for 1977, and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC. Spielberg's 3rd feature film is a breakthrough, and one mans drive and vision of his childhood dreams. Spielberg is the man, and he was only 28 then, War of the Worlds basically relies on CGI effects, still fun, but this is the best(friendly) alien encounter film ever. Hope that didn't spoil anything. Entertaining, hands down, or up, if your reaching for the dark skys.",4.0
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Rated PG.
Directed and written by Steven Spielberg. Also written by Hal Barwood, Jerry Belson, John Hill, Matthew Robbins.
Original music by John Williams.
 Definitely a film that should be seen in the movie theater.  Perhaps it should be re-released again.
The best science-fiction film ever made. Every child and adult should see it.

  Rod Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is married to Ronnie (Teri Garr).  They have three children, Brad (Shawn Bishop), Justin (Toby Dreyfuss [yes, his nephew] and Silvia (Adrienne Campbell).  He is a good father, sometimes stressed out, but he is also a sensitive man.  One night, he gets an emergency call from his work. Being an electrical lineman, he has to go out. He drives to a rural area near Muncie, Indiana and stops at a railroad crossing.  This moment is about to change him.  He continues to have visions of something, but he does not know what it is yet.
  In Muncie, Indiana, there is a mother, Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) who raises her 3-year old young son, Barry (Cary Guffey).  There is some kind of storm brewing over. The boy wakes up and suddenly the toys come on and the vacuum runs around. The kitchen is a mess. The boy runs outside laughing and playing. Jillian runs after him and climbs up a roadside. Barry stands in the middle of the road and almost gets hit by Rod's truck, but Jillian is quick to get her boy off the road and so was Rod quick enough to stop the truck.  Then, several UFO's fly above them. That is just the beginning.

Also in the cast: Bob Balaban, Francois Truffaut, Roberts Blossom, George DiCenzo, Howard K. Smith, Carl Weathers, J. Patrick McNamara, Lance Henriksen.
That is Susan Seaforth Hayes and Bill Hayes in a real television clip from Days of Our Lives (NBC). As of this writing, they are still on the serial together.

This version does not include the ""Special Edition"" ending made in 1980 for the re-issue of the film. However, the ""Special Edition"" new ending is seen in the Deleted Scenes on Disc 2.

  Disc Two includes a 1 hour and 41 minute documentary, ""The Making Of Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  Very interesting details about filming locations, casting, a deleted scene, and seven new scenes added into the 1980 re-issue called ""Special Edition: Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  Also on Disc Two, an over 4-minute theatrical trailer of the original film and a theatrical trailer for the ""Special Edition"" version.  An over 5-minute 1977 featurette of the original film.  Over 15 unseen deleted scenes not seen in the original and not the ""Special Edition"", except for the ""Special Edition"" ending which is shown.

  The original ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" was released in 1977.  It ran at 2 hours, 15 minutes.
  In 1980, Steven Spielberg re-worked the film cutting some scenes out and adding newly-filmed scenes with more of Richard Dreyfuss inside the Mothership.  It also included the song, ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" in end credits.
  For the ABC Network version in the 1980's, another version of the film was made.  It included the ""Special Edition"", but with ""all existing footage"" from the original film also added.  It ran at over 2 hours and 20 minutes.

  In 1998, Steven Spielberg again re-edited the film for a DVD ""Collector's Edition"".  It does not include the ""Special Edition"" ending of inside the Mothership with Richard Dreyfuss.  Running Time: 2 hours, 17 minutes.
2002 DVD release. Single Disc. Widescreen. No Special Features.

Option of Language: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Thai.
Option of Subtitles: English Dolby Surround, English Dolby Digital, English dts, French, Spanish.

All of us fans hope that some day soon, Steven Spielberg may release the ultimate longest version with the original footage and the ""special edition"" footage and the additional network television footage all together in the movie itself and release it on DVD.  A full-screen version (standard) would be nice too. (In December 2007, All versions of the film was released in a new ultimate DVD package).
  Subliminals: The top of the mothership made to look like an oil refinery with pipes and tubes, but subliminally to suggest scale like the New York City skyscrapers. The bottom of the ship like a huge breast, hence the name Mothership.
  In a tight shot as ship flies in (rock and Melinda Dillon on right), a little upside-down R2-D2 (Star Wars [1977]) is hanging to the left of three circle lights.
  The shapes in the shaving cream, the mud pack, the mashed potatoes are subliminal to what you will finally see.

This movie was chosen to be preserved and added to the National Film Registry in 2007 by the National Film Preservation Board, Library of Congress.

"This turned out to be a good combination comedy and horror film. Yes, the  humor is geared more for teens but people far older than 15 should still get a lot of laughs out of this. I did, and I'm a lot older (a lot!).

Warning: some of the scenes are pretty gross, at least for a comedy, but that's what made those particularly scenes funny.

The film reminded me a bit of ""American Werewolf in London"" with the ""undead"" kids. Despite the absurdity of it, there are a couple of good messages in here....but, generally, this is purely escapist fun.",4.0
"IDLE HANDS is a movie that I remember always being on the USA Network when I was really young, and I remember it was a sick movie. It still is, but now older (but not wiser), I see this movie for how it should be seen: a twisted little gem that turns the Dawson's Creek world inside out. Yes, SCREAM did it too, but for some reason, the way IDLE HANDS shows us a guy that loves the girl next door and has two dumb buddies like every bad teen movie ever makes the fact that the movie is about a stoner that kills his parents and best friends (who come back as freaking zombies) with his possessed right hand (hi, Ash) so much sweeter. Yes, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but this movie really is underrated in my opinion. It has great music (especially The Offspring's version of The Ramones' I WANNA BE SEDATED), a clever script, great performances (especially by Seth Green & Elden Henson as the zombified buddies Mick and Pnub, who didn't walk up the stairway to Heaven because ""it was too far""), and sly direction by Rodman Flender, who has done TALES FROM THE CRYPT episodes, which at times this movie shares its tone with. Overall, IDLE HANDS is great for horror fans that like their horror with a wink and a nod, and it even throws in some unnecessary nudity, just like the good ol' days.",4.0
"Pity poor slacker kid Anton Tobias (Devon Sawa): he hasn't seen his parents for days. He's out of milk. He's out of dog food. He has no girl, no car, no central motivating ambition. He's a total loser.

Worst of all, he's ""dry"": totally out of fuel for the bong. Forced to face the bleak prospect of a cheerless world not percolating to the hazy slacker cumulus of marijuana. Oh, and there's a brutal serial killer loose on the streets: a maniac who slaughters his victims, skins them alive, and---when the need arises---takes eyeballs and other chunky bits as souvenirs.

Life can be a real b*tch when you haven't yet turned 18.

Anyway, things quickly get rough, brutal, bloody, and totally out of hand (heh). Questions mount right along with the body count: Where are Anton's parents? Who is slaughtering his friends and neighbors? Is it wise to try score weed off a cop, even if y'all went to the same high school? Will Anton ever really muster up enough courage to ask the hottie of his dreams (the truly luscious Jessica Alba) to the prom? And it is possible---perhaps probable?---that his suddenly wanderlusting hand might have something to do with the wanton bloodletting and recent reign of terror?

""Idle Hands"" is perfectly adorable on all counts and entertains scandalously: don't be alarmed by the 90210-ish packaging or the blurbs that make this thing out to be an innocent romantic comedy.

I was nearly scared away by all the chick-friendly marketing, but I persisted---and happily, I found this little romp in the cemetery to be sick, twisted, and totally freakish. Seth Green (Anton's slacker buddy Mick) gets to spend some up-close-and-personal cranial quality time with a beer bottle (local brew). Buddy Pnub (the hysterical and eminently blase Eldon Henson) loses his head and sees his social life improve---albeit with a little duct tape and a garden trowel. Dexter (lead singer of Offspring, who does a killer cover of the Ramones ""I wanna be Sedated"") gets scalped by an evil possessed right hand (played, admirably and with great dramatic restraint, by Christopher Hart, who plays hands and nothing else. I'm not kidding).

""Idle Hands"", turned out by director Rodman Flender and a talented SWAT team of special effects mavericks, is simply all kinds of cool.

I mean, come on: you have Ramones cover songs. You have Hands Baked Alaska in the microwave. You have adorable little kitty cats nibbling away at eyeballs and licking up spilled blood. You have one of the uber-coollest opening sequences (""I'm Under the Bed""---oh BOO-ya!) in horror movie history, in which veteran character actor Fred Willard plays Dad. You have Vivica Fox brandishing a meat-cleaver and screaming ""die, Host of Evil!"". You get ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Evil Dead"" tributes---who am I kidding, ""Idle Hands"" is itself one long Evil Dead tribute. You get slacker friends consigned to walk the Earth forever as the soulless Living Dead---all because they hated the white light, the Enya Music, and the general sense that Heaven meant having to ""walk to far"".

Anyway, the horrific, ugly, malign, diabolic evil slaughtering hand is one of the staples of Grand Guignol horror, and Flender and Company hit the ball out of the park and work their material like champs. Hell ain't so bad if you have good (undead) friends and plenty of Cheesey-Poofs---give the boy a Hand.

"Close Encounters of the Third Kind was a revolutionary film for its time, which is why it is so highly appreciated by so many.  Including moi.  It not only wowed people with special effects, but a story line.  For once, an alien film didn't include corny music and screaming women standing out in the streets, or little green men shooting lasers or what not.  This film brought sci-fi films to a new degree.
So often, we see sci-fi films inter-relate with horror films, this is no horror film, it's a true sci-fi film.  The suspense does not come from terror, but from wonder and awe.
I've read some reviews that state that you shouldn't show awe towards aliens that kidnap and brainwash people.  From what I saw, there was no brainwashing, and the kidnapping was not as big a deal as you may think at first.
Richard Dreyfuss gives a hell of a performance in this.  He's an ordinary guy whose life gets turned around by these phenominal events, which are the sighting of UFOs.  Other ordinary people are effected as well.  This is the power of the film.  The heroes aren't these Indiana Jones or super experts who know ""everything"" about aliens.  They are people, like you and I, who have a drastic change of viewpoint.
Other reviewers complain about Dreyfuss's character because he becomes obsessed with this phenom.  Well, excuse me, but if your entire world as you knew it was suddenly changed because you realized that there were higher forms of intelligent life out there, you might become obsessed yourself in figuring out the truth.  It's realistic and human to be curious.
I think this movie was very realistic and avoided the corny, unrealism of other sci-fi junk.  The negatives of this movie is:
1. Not enough Alien parts, meaning there needed to be more encounters with Dreyfuss or with other people.  There were only two, not counting the end.  This isn't enough, at least I felt, to get a good grip that this film is about Aliens and not government cover up.  Because the first third is about the Aliens impacting people's lives, while the other two thirds is government conspiracy or the recreation of Devil's Peak either through dirt, mashed potatos, or drawings.
2. As a result, to not enough encounters with the Aliens, the film can be quite boring at certain points.  Now when I say encounters, I don't necessarily mean having more scenes where they fly around and buzz people with their space ships.  Not at all, I mean more alien phenoms, like the ship in the middle of the desert or the lost air planes now suddenly found.  These were great, there needed to be more of them.
3. The ending.  I don't know, it was awe inspiring but at the same time real boring.  There needed to be a climax, and I think Spielberg felt that the aliens showing themselves would be it.  I'd rather they hadn't shown the aliens, that would've been more real.  Think about it, making contact with an entirely different species?  Not real.
Plus, Dreyfuss just suddenly given the nod to travel with them, even though he's wanted by the government?  I mean come on, not real.
4. Because this film has some lengthy, boring scenes, it's more likely than not this won't be an addictive film.  You may see it more than once but you'll probably allow a great deal of time to pass in between, because it's a film of wonder not a film of entertainment galore.
As you can see, there are some flaws that keep this film from being totally realistic.  But for the most part it is, and I liked it.  I think you need to see this film, you will enjoy it for the first time at least.  Seeing it again and again?  I don't know about that.  That's why it's four stars and not five.
Grade: B",4.0
"dont care what anybody says about this movie, I liked it and enjoyed it. it mixes comedy and gross out death that is awesome. Devon Sawa(Final Destination, Little Giants) finds out that his parents( one of them played by Fred Willard) are dead and that a psycho killer is on the loose, which points to Sawa after he kills his two best friends Seth Green(Rat Race, Party Monster) and Elden Henson(""O"", She's All That). then they come back to life as zombies and help Sawa with his problem, so then Sawa kills some cops and then cuts off his hand (like in Evil Dead 2) and then his hand ecapes and starts killing people. Sawa trys to save Jessica Alba(Honey, Dark Angel) and Vivica A. Fox(Kill Bill Vol. 1, Batman and Robin) is the woman who knows about the possession of his hand because it spreads. also in the cast is Jack Noseworthy(Event Horizon, Alive) who falls in love with Fox. good romp with some funny moments. the band The Offspring appears at the Halloween dance and the lead singer gets the top of his head ripped off",4.0
"Steven Spielberg's second smash hit, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is an effective, optimistic, and visually appealing film.  In the light of current special effects, it's showing its age, but the story still retains wonder and interest.  Richard Dreyfuss is very effective as the man who sights a group of U.F.O.'s and then becomes obsessed with them.  Others that have made sightings share the obsession, including a woman whose child is abducted by the aliens.  A seed is implanted in their minds that draws them to Wyoming.  Their stories are intercut with the story of two scientists (played by Truffault and Baliban) who are investigating the strange re-appearance of ships and planes that have been missing for years, and which turn up in strange locales.  They, too, receive a message (along the more conventional method of radio contact) to head to Wyoming.
Dreyfuss logs the bulk of the screen time, and he easily carries the film.  As his marriage melts down in the wake of his obsession, he manages to maintain our sympathy and interest.  Truffault is a surprisingly effective actor, even when speaking through an interpreter.  Even the child that gets abducted has a great performance.  Likewise, the pacing and suspense through the first 2/3 of the film is flawlessly executed by Spielberg, not revealing too much and intercutting short bursts of action with more contemplative and personal scenes.
Unfortunately, the film grinds down to a deadly pace in the last 1/3 of the film.  It is essentially 40 minutes of a faceless mob (of scientists) and Dreyfuss staring at the sky and watching lights appear and disappear.  Yes, the effects are good, even by today's standards, but it is boring!  Similarly, Teri Garr as the protagonist's wife is nothing but a carricatured harpy, and their breakup is clumsily handled by the immature (at the time) director.  All in all, though, the film holds up well to time and repeated viewings.
This DVD edition is quite nice, with a 100-minute feature with commentary and insight from most of the principle filmakers and stars (except Truffault, who had passed away).  Spielberg does not do commentaries for his films, but he talks a lot in the feature which should sate the film buffs.  There are also some deleted scenes, including the ""new"" ending Columbia demanded for the ""Special Edition"" release in 1980.  The original 1977 ending is maintained for the film on this DVD (and rightfully so!).",4.0
"... Unlike the sci-fi films of the 1950's that revolve around UFO's and alien contact on Earth that usually had the aliens being evil and coming to dominate and destroy the Earth,  Mr. Spielberg depicts them as benign and friendly.  The visual effects were first rate in 1977 and are a far cry from today's studio wizardry, they are not hokey and actually hold up well.  The cast all give fine performances including Mr. Dreyfuss, Teri Garr as his beleaguered wife and Melinda Dillon scored a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her role as a fellow contactee.  Although the film was not nominated for Best Picture, Mr. Spielberg received his first Best Director nomination and the film won one award for Best Cinematography and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects.",4.0
"I'm not at all a slasher movie fan, but for some reason I had to see this. I think it was because of the comedy overtones I read about. I must say it is definately funny. I really enjoyed the comedy approach as the movie went on. I was reminded of the Evil Dead/Army of Darkness series(you'll see). As for the senseless gore...I could've done without most of it. However, they did a pretty good job on the blood, make-up and special effects.
This movie would make a great Halloween flick. It's really creepy at times and great for a laugh at other times. I'll keep this one in my DVD collection just for that right moment.",4.0
"Rodman Flender's comic-horror movie is the story of teenage stoner Anton's ordeal when his right hand becomes posessed by an evil spirit and goes on a murderous rampage, killing anyone and everyone it encounters including his best friends Mick and Pnub. The posessed hand soon sets it's sights on Anton's crush Molly and Mick and Pnub come back from the grave to help their friend save the girl. The movie has a great cast with Devon Sawa (Final Destination) playing Anton, the show stealing Seth Green (TV's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Rat Race & the Austin Powers movies) as Mick, Jessica Alba (TV's Dark Angel) as Molly as well as a great performance from Vivica A. Fox (Independence Day). To go with the gore and gross out laughs the film also has a kicking soundtrack featuring the likes of Rob Zombie, Static-X, Rancid and of course The Offspring, who make a cameo as the band at the school halloween dance with singer Dexter Holland having his scalp ripped off. The movie pays homage to several cult classics including Night Of The Living Dead, Re-Animator, An American Werewolf in London and the original Halloween (it was filmed in the same neighbourhood).

"My favorite movie, hands down. It's merited my favor simply because of it's stunning visual effects, which still hold up wonderfully during this age of increasing use of CG effects.
Everything from lens flares to the dazzling colors to the
twinkling starfields are all there in their digital glory.
Still, having seen most versions of the film with it's various
edits and changes, I still wish for the complete version of the film with all scenes intact. Also, the documentary seems to have a few scenes missing that were on the collector's widescreen edition(VHS), such as alien sequences and test prints not used in the film. Also, it sure is hard to read those subtitles in
widescreen! I should not gripe, though. The movie is a long-awaited addition to my DVD collection, and the extensive behind-the-scenes sections and deleted scenes sections more than make up
for any flaws. Why be a completist? Enjoy the movie!  -KS",4.0
"The film starts and we see UFOs flying above. Roy sees it up close, and becomes obsessed with finding out what is going, at the expense of his family who think he's gone crazy. He becomes friends with a women he met the night he saw the UFOs, who had her son abducted. They both have visions of a tower, that holds some sort of significance. When they see on TV that near Devils Tower in Wyoming, there has been an evacuation because of a toxic spill, they both realize this is the tower they have been seeing. They travel there, and find an awful lot of mysteries there. What is going on at this tower, that is calling these UFO witnesses there, as well as the military?
This is one of Steven Spielbergs first films, and was very successful. At the time their was a lot of interest in UFOs in the mainstream. The special effects in this movie are stunning, and the UFOs look amazing. There is also a small romance undercurrent present. The film is open ended and has a lot to be interpreted, letting us use our imagination to build upon the story's conclusion. Kids and adults will enjoy this film, but there is some profanity. Any fan of science fiction absolutely needs to see this film. 4 stars. Check it out.",4.0
"This is a nicely packaged set for this famous 70's film.  Tons of extra info is included for those who wish to delve into the minutae of the films development and arrival on the screen.  This is one of Spielberg's more intriguing films, yet it leaves me curiously unmoved.  The storyline is good.  The effects are really good.  The script is good.  The locations are fantastic.  The acting is good.  I don't know what it is, but this is a film that I am rarely tempted to watch.  For me, this is a ""pull it out once every five years"" film.  I find the development of the plot lines to be interesting and one that raises numerous questions.  I just am not terribly interested in the way the director chose to answer those questions.  It doesn't gel for me.  In the end I kind of have a 'so that's it?' feeling.
The DVD treatment here is exquisite-more than you need really, but that is a good thing.  I found the extras more compelling than the film itself.  I probably would not recommend the film on its own, but the inclusion of so much other material makes this a good buy.",4.0
"This film is a true science fiction classic.  When it was first released in 1977, it competed with Star Wars as one of the top films of the year.  Richard Dreyfus stars as Ray Neary, a man who  suddeenly begins to have visions and hear voices.  Terri Garr stars as Dreyfus' wife.  Finally, Ray's visions begin to take strange turns, and he ends up constructing a model of Devil's Tower in his living room.  By this time, his wife and children have left him.  Meanwhile, odd occurances are happening all over the world.  A flight of Navy torpedo bombers missing since 1945 suddenly shows up in Mexico in almost brand new condition, and a ship is found in the middle of the Gobi Desert.  The voices finally lead Ray and others to Devil's Tower in Wyoming.  There, a large spaceship lands with people that have been missing for years, including the pilots of the torpedo bombers.
This movie is loaded with special effects which were excellent for their time, and it still remains one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.  All sci-fi fans should watch this excellent movie.",4.0
"great for a teenage horror flick that doesn't intend to be serious about what's going on (how could it with pot-smoking zombies???) you can see influence from Evil Dead2 (!!!) and Return Of The Living Dead to the modern-Day Scream horror-mania, all that with a good portion from Half Baked makes a good teenager-horror-party-flick with some truly great gory scenes, a great humor and an awesome soundtrack (Offspring, Rob Zombie, etc) great fun to watch, especially if you liked the above stated movies",4.0
"I rented this movie because Playboy Playmate Kelly Monaco has a featured role.  Idle Hands is an entertaining, funny, and delightful movie nevertheless.  Christopher Hart of Addams Family fame (""Thing""), and other roles requiring his enmorously long fingers, plays Devon's severed hand.  At one point, Hart's hand enters a car window as Kelly and her boyfriend are making out.  This scene is quite hot and Charistopher Hart's lone hand gets in on the fun.  His large hand and long fingers really give Kelly's rack a workout!",4.0
"""Idle Hands"" is an Infinitely Enjoyable film. It tries to make it's audience Laugh more than Scream, and it Achieves it's Goal.
Devon Sewa stars as Anton Tobias, a High School Slacker who's Hand seems to be Possessed. Along with his Equally Lazy Friends (turned Un-dead Lazy Friends) Mick (Seth Green) and Pnub (Eldon Henson), and his Girlfriend Molly (Jessica Alba), Anton sets out to stop his Evil hand from Killing Everyone he Knows.
Sewa does a Great job Carrying the film, He can jump from Slapstick to Serious in a Second, he gives his Hand a Character of his own, and he has Definite Leading man Potential. Alba is the most Talented Screen Goddess to emerge since Salma Heyek in ""Desperado"", plus (like Salma) she is Funny, Smart and Believable. Green and Henson play the Comic Relief roles well, but the Material occasionally leaves them high and dry with nothing Clever to say. But on a Whole, they are two Funny guys.
The Bizarre Storyline provides Ample Shocks and Sniggers, but it Never really strives for Outright Horror or Comedy, it aims for the Middle ground and it claims it well. Critics have attacked the film for it's Gross out Violence and Dim-witted humour... But isn't that what the Audiences want.
""Idle Hands"" may not have been a Critical or Commercial Success, but, in time, it will develop into a Cult Success.",4.0
"The series was based on three female detectives who worked for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency. Charlie, who was their anonymous boss, gave them  assignments via a speaker phone.

"There's been a raging argument since this film's release back in the late 70's: which is the better science fiction film, STAR WARS or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND?
I think those who've engaged that argument have been going about debate much the wrong way, for there are really no similarities in these two pictures except for the fact that both includes aliens and otherworldly craft ... but the comparison really stops there.
After its initial release, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS enjoyed a second release not much later with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS: THE SPECIAL EDITION, which added footage cut and/or reshot to make the film a bit closer to visionary Steven Spielberg's dream picture.  The added footage, however, really was tacked onto the end of the film, giving viewers a glance inside the Mothership of the UFOs that have been haunting Earth.
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND: THE SPECIAL EDITION is an amalgam of the two films, preserving the best essence of the two pictures by creating one complete whole.
Perhaps the greatest nod to this film is that there would be no THE X FILES without this film having been made.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS paved the way found countless variations on the theme of extraterrestrial contact.  In fact, Spielberg himself had initially dubbed E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL as the unofficial sequel to CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, but he changed his mind last minute as the two films really have very little linkage.
This two-disc compilation boasts an excellent digitally mastered (audio and visual) product along with Dolby DTS and Dolby 5.1.  The second disc includes a Making of Documentary that gives some valuable history to the picture as well as commenting seriously on the films of Spielberg as a whole.  The deleted scenes add little to a film that already holds a complete rung on the ladder of the film industry.",4.0
"We live in an area of New Zealand which has a large rock outcropping similar to that shown early-on in the film, so wanted to view Close Encounters once again to see how close the resemblance really was. That said, we went on to get just as enchanted by our latest viewing as when the movie was first released. Definitely a classic! (And the local rock formation is really quite accurate!)",4.0
I think this is a really funny movie.  Like Ghostbusters with comedy and horror.  And Jessica Alba is the most beautiful woman ever.  It has really great acting.,4.0
"This is obviously not meant to win an oscar, and if you start with that attitude, it may help.  I enjoyed this movie very much, except for the drug promotion.  Seth Green as usual is a master, don't be suprised to see him nominated for an Oscar for real, SOMEDAY. For us males, Jessica Alba will steal your heart throughout this movie, and her rear end puts Jennifer Lopez to shame.  Your teen age kids will all like this, mine did.  And I laughed right with them. Take it for what its worth and meant to be, and you may find yourself in stitches if you are not careful.",4.0
"I fully agree with the Amazon reviewer's opinion that the movie is just an excuse to string together silly gags and gross-out gore.  I'm not sure that  makes it a horrible film.  Hey, Dead Alive and Evil Dead, classics of the  genre, are built from the same formula.  They do it smarter and funnier,  but Idle Hands is not without its charms.
You've got the Seth Green  factor (I'd watch Spiceworld II: The wrath of Ginger if he was in it), the  Dexter from Offspring getting slaughtered factor, the  giant-fan-as-teen-blender factor, the Vivica Fox as martial arts demon  hunting babe factor, the scantily clad Jessica Alba factor.
In other  words, you've got your funny, you've got your bloody, and you've got your  sexy, all in one cheesy package.  If the ending wasn't so horrifically bad,  I'd give this one five stars (Some DVDs have the original ending, which I  haven't seen).  It ain't Citizen Kane, but you know that already.  If  you're a fan of the genre -- B comedy-horror flicks -- this is a worthwhile  entry.",4.0

"The most telling thing about ""Close Encounters"" is that it's been out for a quarter of a century, and even Steven Spielberg doesn't feel he's *quite* gotten it right yet.  The 2001 DVD print is the ""Collector's Edition"", and is not the same as the version you remember from the movie theater, cable television, or the laserdisc (depending on how you were first introduced to the film).
As with Spielberg's later ""A.I."" (also generally regarded as a misfire), this is a darker science-fiction fable than you'd expect from the director.  The sense of discovery and wonder is present from start to finish, in images and pictures if not so much in words.  The UFO display lighting up the pitch-black Indiana sky, or soaring over the Devil's Tower, haunted my dreams for years, just from seeing the TV trailers at a young age, long before I'd watched the movie.  From that stand point ""Close Encounters"" is one of our most enduring films.
Less well-remembered is Richard Dreyfuss's role as Roy Neary, a man whose life is quite literally torn apart by his encounter and subsequent visions.  Almost unbelievably for a Spielberg film, Neary's marriage does't survive the film (Terri Garr does at least lends unexpected depth to what could have been a thankless role), and we're left wondering if he'll be reunited with his three children -- or if Roy Neary really cares?  The one family scene before his close encounter shows that he's pretty well alienated from his home to begin with.  Was he happy with his life before the flying saucers found him?  Will he ever return to Earth?  What does Spielberg mean by that U.S.S. Enterprise hanging in Roy's living room? :-)
The film is rife with Spielberg's great cinematic signatures and humorous touches (the UFOs, who are first mistaken for a truck pulling up behind Roy's vehicle, lift up and fly *over* him, but he's too busy reading a map to notice).  The final half-hour of the film is virtually dialogue free -- at least, in this particular edition -- and ends in a show of lights that mirrors the look of ""2001""'s last segment, if lacking in that earlier film's impact.
The DVD transfer is, as others have said, a joy to watch.  The special features are a bit repetitive -- the making-of documentary is nearly as long as the movie -- and not all the footage from all the versions of the movie have been incorporated.
Most Spielberg fans will not find this to be his most cohesive work.  Indeed, one day Spielberg may return to the picture yet again.  But the physical package is impressive, and the 4 hours you spend with these discs are 4 hours that you don't need to spend watching ""A.I.""",4.0
"This version is basically the 1980 ""Special Edition"" without the ridiculous ""inside the Mother Ship"" sequence at the end. All of the other scenes added for the special edition (The ship in the desert and the additional scenes of Roy Neary's breakdown) are here. The main scene cut from the original version, which shows Roy Neary at work at the power station is still missing, but it is present as one of 11 deleted scenes on the second disk of this set. Most of these scenes were justifiably cut from the film, adding nothing to the story. Most interesting is an alternate meeting between Bob Balaban and Francios Truffaut in a limousine at an airport. Similar dialog but different. This scene was clearly meant to follow the air traffic control scene that is still in the movie. Also includes the obligatory ""Making of Documentary, clearly shot at the same time as ""Saving Private Ryan"" as Spielberg is filmed in front of a debris strewn European street. This is a first class DVD presentation. I just wish that they could have done what they did with ""The Abyss"" and include BOTH versions of the film.",4.0
"This movie was much better than I expected. It was really funny, and Seth Green is hilarious. But I can't believe its overlooked that The Offspring appear in this movie.

"Admittedly, an engaging, enchanting film.  25 years later the performance of French film director Francois Truffaut as a foreign scientist, Richard Dreyfuss's obsession with mashed potatoes, and the sonic exploration of the octave and its overtones remain nestled in the viewer's subconscious, if not conscious, memory.  But in retrospect this film followed an era in which an idealistic generation, once devoted to social change and the immortalization of its own youth culture, had to settle for the latter of the two possibilities.  The ""story"" represents not just an escape from the banality of middle-class values but from responsibilities, conflicts, risky human relationships, and life itself.  Another capitalistic commodity pretending to renounce a way of life it in fact promotes and is inextricably bound to, ""Close Encounters"" is the first of many blockbuster ""Third Kind"" epics to achieve success on the big screen.  Play it with a good sound system.",4.0
"I experienced this film as a young lad and am pleased to own this very good DVD reproduction. Aside from all the obvious DVD advantages, I really enjoyed the extra features on this two-disc DVD. The interviews with Spielberg and others involved in the film are pretty facinating and insightful.

Not the best film  to display his immense talent, but Green definately shines in this movie.  Jessica Alba (and I hold no biases based on my love for her haha) also  displays that young talent, although often type-cast, can still bring 'em  home.
I wasn't impressed with Vivica A. Fox's character in any way, but  the others seemed to click with me.

"Most people will be buying this film simply because it's a Spielberg, and a lot of people (like myself) who will be buying it have probably never seen it before.  So since it was the first time I had seen this movie, I think it is fitting that I first saw it on DVD.  'Cause if I had watched it on VHS I don't think I would have liked it as much (due to the surround sound effects).  For an old film I thought it was great, it has that special Spielberg touch that gives you that awe and wonder about what's going to happen next.  Some younger viewers may not understand the film fully, this film was inspired by Spielberg's Dad waking him up in the middle of the night and watching a meteor shower.",4.0
"Like several other reviewers, I am something of a Close Encounters connoisseur, having viewed every different cut of this movie since the original 1977 release.  My least favorite, by far, was the so-called ""Special Edition"" that was released in 1980 and for years was the only version available for home viewing.  I always felt that the deletion of certain scenes from that version made the story difficult to follow and the flow of the movie somewhat choppy.  The shot of Dreyfuss inside the Mother Ship killed much of the mystery and wonder that surrounded the ending in the original cut.  When the movie was aired on network TV back in the early 80's, a complete version was shown, including all of the original '77 footage and the additional ""Special Edition"" scenes edited together.  With the exception of the scene inside the spacecraft, this version would have to be my favorite.  As a fan, I feel like I'm getting the complete Close Encounters experience when I watch this cut of the film.  In every other version, somehow I feel cheated when a scene, or even a quick camera shot, is missing.  In 1990, Criterion released a laser disc version of this film that included all the footage.  My hope was that the ""Collector's Edition,"" as this DVD edition is called, would also include the ""complete"" film.  While the Collector's Edition is a vast improvement over the Special Edition, I still find myself wishing that a few extra scenes could have been included in the main feature.  I always felt that the scene showing Neary at the power plant was necessary to explain to the viewer why he's out in the middle of nowhere looking for downed power lines.  This is on Disc 2 as a deleted scene, but without this short scene included in the main feature it requires the viewer to make an a cognitive jump in regard to the story-line, and is actually quite confusing to the first-time viewer.  Another deletion (that's not included on Disc 2) is where Neary ""sees"" the mysterious shape in a pillow at home.  Later in the film he refers to this previous vision, but since the scene referred to has been deleted in this version, it doesn't have the full impact on the viewer that it could.  There's a few other minor exclusions that die-hard fans will wish were on there.  Fortunately, Spielberg deceided NOT to include the interior shot of the spacecraft in the main feature, so the mystery remains (not to mention the end of the film flows a lot better without this additional scene, in my opinion).  I still feel the Criterion release on laser disc is superior, at least from a content perspective.  You had the option of watching the original '77 cut that was released in theaters, the 1980 ""Special Edition,"" or a complete cut of the movie with all scenes, all depending on how you programmed your laser disc player.  Perhaps Criterion will see fit to re-release this movie on DVD using the same format as their previous laser disc set.
In conclusion, I feel this cut (the ""Collector's Edition"") is excellent, the transfer seems good, and the documantary and extras on Disc 2 are a real treat.  Nevertheless, truly die-hard fans will find themselves wanting a slightly more complete cut of the film.",4.0
"I thought that the DVD version of Close Encounters is a fine presentation of the film with very good extras.  My only problem is with the crumby package the discs are stored in.  I've only opened it a handfull of times but it's already starting to show stress points between the 2 disc containers.  Simalar (but better designed) packaging used for ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and the 2 disc version of ""Boogie Nights"" would have been a better choice all-around.  So, by all means buy the disc but be aware of the flimsy packaging design.",4.0
"Laserdisc collectors already have the definitive version of this movie courtesy of the Criterion Disc.  Most but not all of those bonus goodies are included here.  The ""new"" documentary/interview footage is actually a punched-up version of an old one released years ago on Laserdisc.  I still have the Criterion Laserdisc version, and that will be the one I go to when the time rolls around to watch this movie again.  Spielberg did the same thing when he released ""Jaws"" on DVD in July of 2000.  What should have been a definitive release was instead an abbreviated version (I'm referring to bonus stuff, here) of the edition released as a Collector's set on Laserdisc years before.  What gives, Steve?",4.0
"The Original, The Special Edition, The TV Version, The Laser Disc Version, and finally the DVD Collector's Version have all shown up.  The DVD is done very well, with some outstanding interviews and behind the scenes info.  Spielberg's segment was particular telling in his take on how he,and all of us most likely, have changed, matured, or simply developed a different slant on life. What strikes me about this version is what it is lacking.  It is a well know fact that Spielberg regreted filming the inside-the-ship segment inserted into the Special Edition.  But in all fairness, it should have been included in the deleted-scenes portion of the special features.  There were numerous other scenes that could also have been included in the same way. Regardless of some interesting supplemental material, the Laser Disc version had so much more, and also included many versions of scenes that had been removed or changed. Don't get me wrong, CE3K is one of the top 10 movies of all time in any version, and the DVD stands very tall on it's own.  Perhaps in the future we will see Close Encounters of the 6th Kind, a version that includes every feature from every version released.",4.0

"I didn't have high expectations for this movie so I was delighted when it proved to be funny, clever, and well-made. The actors do a great job and the dialogue is totally believable; despite the pot-smoking and lax  attitude of the teenagers, the swearing is relatively limited, which I  always think of as a sign of a good film. Don't get me wrong - this isn't a  great film, it's silly schlock - but it's entertaining, fun schlock.  Watching the film with the audio commentary by the director and two of the  actors (after you've seen the film straight through the first time) is a  blast and a half. Definitely worth getting on DVD just for the audio  commentary. Reminds me of a combination of Half-Baked, Clerks, and Evil  Dead 2.",4.0

"I love the little comment a previous reviewer said about ""Closet Cases of the Nerd Kind."" I remember seeing that parody on HBO years ago and it was before seeing the ""actual"" film. The scene where Richard Dreyfuss looks at the shaving cream and says ""This means something,"" I still haven't recovered myself from restraining the laugh-fest. Maybe someday that parody and ""Hardware Wars,"" can make an appearance on DVD!
It wasn't until the Special Edition came out in theatres where I finally got to see it with all the added scenes. Yet, after watching this DVD version I love it! The movie most definitely does better without all the added stuff. The sound and picture are better than it ever was in theatres but that's also a testament to explain how far the technology of sound has come from. Let's face it, I saw the Special Edition in theatres in 82! Sound has most definitely improved since then, thank God! The picture quality is unbelievable and after watching ""Superman The Movie"" it's great to see our classic films get the facelift they deserve, even though most of these actors need facelifts of their own:) Just kidding!",4.0
"As someone who lists this as one of his all-time favorite movies, I couldn't get this DVD fast enough. However, I was quite dissapointed with the first disc. The digital remastering was fantastic, but I can't understand why the Special Edition wasn't the feature. The Special Edition, especially with the inside-the-ship scenes, far outweighs the original. Also, there are other scenes which should have been left in instead of being shown on the Deleted Scenes on Disc 2. Roy Neary getting the assignment from the power plant and getting bad directions was critical to his first encounter. Also, the scene where he first sees the mound shape in the pillow is missing. My personal favorite, at the BBQ, when he gets everyone looking up has a fantastic dual meaning. He is looking up into the heavens and being worn out by the domestic boredom on Earth at the same time. Disc 2 saves this set. I have always wondered how Spielberg pulled this off. The Documentary is incredible. Over an hour and a half of inside info that makes viewing this movie even more enjoyable, if possible. I give it 4 stars, only because I believe that the Special Edition would have been worthy of five. Thank You.",4.0
"Just a comment on the previous post: Allegedly, Spielberg never wanted the ""inside the mothership"" ending, but the studio asked him to add it when they let him add all the extra ""special edition"" footage in 1980.

"Spielberg's alien masterpiece about aliens invading Earth was an instant classic in the seventies, and is still a great film, better than Star Wars. Why? Because we can identify more with a middle-aged electrician than we can with a moisture farmer on a desert planet. Richard Dreyfuss is the aforementioned electrician, who has an extraterrestrial experience and suddenly is obsessed with these aliens. This epic is an excellent early work of Stephen and truly delights the senses as well as the mind, and is still extremely watchable today. Now, for the faults. It starts slow and never really builds to a frantic pace, but it only increases the suspense. Although the aliens are a little disappointing (just the basic pointy-eyed, almond faced stereotypes), these faults are easily compensated in this amazing experience. One of the best sci-fi movies of all time.

"Without a doubt, one of Spielberg's best.  A clean, well-written movie  that blows away most alien contact flicks.  Science Fiction done with  respect and love for the genre.  Unfortunately, there are so many versions  of this film floating around that you'd better just wait and see what they  do with the DVD.  I for one hated the ""Special Edition"" and am  just as unimpressed with the Director's Cut.  There are still scenes  missing that need to be restored (including the '77 ending), and only DVD  can do the special effects and soundtrack justice.",4.0
"An intriguing story of a man's quest for answers after he gets buzzed by UFOs late one night.  The movie progresses quickly and rarely lingers, and comes off as one of the more believable close encounter movies around.  It's more than just a sci-fi film, it's a look at what happens when a  person can't explain what's driving them forward.  Highly recommended  except for one flaw; the director's cut removes a few minutes of brilliant  footage of a man going nuts to stick on some fancy special effects.",4.0

"It is hard to believe that this film is 15 years old now: it is as fresh  and refreshing as the year it was made. Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky (written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass) but with Chris Columbus' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.

Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), the two children of Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) Harrison, have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father's life: Isabel (Julia Roberts), a successful photographer. She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.

The lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show.  But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family.  It remains a very fine movie. Grady Harp, May 13",4.0
I thought this was a very touching film and also representative of how blended families function. I thought both Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon did a great job!,4.0
"Having recently lost a parent, I found this film very moving.  It is mature in that it isn't some silly thing about removing the barriers to falling in love - by far the easiest part - but in how to move on after a divorce.  The actors are extremely fine, and their characters evolve throughout the entire film:  the left-over mom is angry, the stepmom is a rather hard-edged career woman, and the kids are expressing pain and hostility in their own way.  Happily, the husband is not a simple jerk, but a guy working very hard to help everyone along the way to whatever comes next.  The way that they all adapt is entirely believable, bringing a realism that you rarely see in love films, and this is surely about love.

Unfortunately, there are certain scenes that don't quite ring true to me, in particular those involving the kids and their rock.  The siblings get on way too well, in particular the young son is way too accommodating and nice.  But overall, it is done with sensitivity, funny without being a comedy, and sad without being a melodrama.

Recommended.  It is nice to see something this sophisticated coming out of the Hollywood mill.",4.0
"The best part of this movie is how authentic the situations are. I grew up with step parents and know what its like to treat the ""step parent"" horribly because, lets face it you could in your mind because they weren't your biological sibling. Julia Roberts shows true courage though and sticks it out until finally the biological mother see's first hand that her kids are in good hands even when she cant be around. Highly recommend this to anyone in a similar situation.",4.0
"""Stepmom"" is an arresting existential drama about the lives and times of a fragmented couple(Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris) with two kids. He has a fiance (Julia Roberts) who has to deserve and then to win respect and affection from these two sensitive children whose unerring behavior is perpetual motive of comparison respect her. In order to melt this emotional iceberg, Roberts who is a successful professional photographer, will have to fight very hard to occupy her own place in the new state of things.

With all these available dramatic premises, the expectations were too high. But the screenwriters bet for a tearful approach in the third movement of the play when a sudden twist of fate will intend to make us aware about the importance of the familiar values, above any serious conceptual difference between the new visitor and the original mother.

The film is intense but the dramatic material promised even much more. Keeping in count the entire cast, it was a real waste.",4.0
"Stepmom starring Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon is a funny and moving film directed by Chris Columbus. Ed Harris also stars and jeez isn't he great in every movie?! I like Roberts in this film, she plays her role as a stepmother with humor and heart. Sarandon's character is a bit annoying but hey she's dying of cancer. Sad, sad, sad film, I highly recommend it!",4.0
"I just rented this because I was interested in seeing more movies with Julia Roberts, one of my favorite Hollywood actresses.  i think she is beautiful and really gets into her parts.  ""Step Mom"" is one of her best films.  I'm not really a big Susan Sarandon fan but she was good in this movie.  It revolves around the lives of the step mother conflcting with the mother from the previous marriage.  The kids in this movie help liven up the movie and unfortunately haven't been in any big name future films since.  Jackie ends up getting cancer later in the movie which will bring tears to your eyes in some scenes.  Isabel (Julia Roberts) is pretty much an artsy photographer who is considered ""hip"" by Jackie, the mother of the children.  They have to put up with Isabel's poor motherhood instincts like accidentally ""losing"" one of the children in one scene.  Later in the movie you grow to like both mothers.  Even the father Luke gets likeable later in the movie as his character becomes more real.  The cast of the movie is pretty talented.  This is one of the better films Julia Roberts has been in.  While ""The Pelican Brief"" is my all-time favorite of hers, ""Stepmom"" is still worth watching even though it's an older movie.  Warning: if you're emotional be sure to bring some tissues with you while watching it.  Definately worth the price.",4.0
"I had to do a paper of this movie for college, so I bought it with reasonably low expectations.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised.  This movie is put together really well, and kept my interest throughout.  The characters are deep and dynamic and the acting is top notch, as is the writing and directing.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone - but make sure you keep a box of tissues handy!",4.0

"I liked this film from start to finish and it has top notch performances. The story is about a terminally-ill mother has to settle on the new woman in her ex-husband's life, who will be their new stepmother. The mother dosent like the way the new women acts and the why she worksa nd has kids. The acting is good from Susan Serandon, Julia Roberta give's a great performance also. Sadely this is a film that is forgotten fast and is underated. Overall it's touching,moving and funny it should entertain the whole family.",4.0
"Stepmom can be slated by people who don't have a heart, but this is one of the best Julia Roberts movies out there. Ed Harris, Susan Sarandon & Julia all do extremely well in this, as do the kids. Jena Malone plays the little girl, and Liam Aiken (Object Of My Affection, Sweet November) plays her younger brother.

I have to say this movie makes me cry every single time. And once you've seen the movie once, you'll start crying earlier & earlier in the movie each time. It's amazing.

Julia & Susan work so well on this film together, that I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. Their love/hate relationship is so good, you actually believe it. The cold stares (something Susan's fabulous at!) make you shiver. And the crying, god, as soon as they start, that's me. Watch out for the conversation about the wedding, if that doesn't get you going nothing will.

This is a truly excellent film, and I'm not going to ruin it anymore for anyone who hasn't seen it. Just make sure the tissues are filled up, and you're either wearing waterproof mascara or none at all.",4.0
"'Stepmom' takes on an emotional journey through the lives of 5 people, 3 adults and 2 children.  Though I found this movie moving, emotional and at times fun, it lacks in truth.  Considering I've been through a divorce with my parents and my father remarried, I know how it is, somewhat.  I know it isn't the same for everyone but I get the jist of it.  As always, Susan Sarandon is infectious (no pun intended), she's one of the most brilliant actresses alive, maybe ever.  Julia Roberts is tough and upfront while Ed Harris shows an emotional, quieter character who doesn't have as much film time as he should.

The two children, Sarandon's and Harris' children are played extremely well.  For their ages, they act similar to what would happen.  The younger boy doesn't feel much different except asks 'mommy, if you want me to hate her [meaning Julia Roberts], I will' - typical for a young boy to side with his mother but also not be angry at the other woman in his fathers life only because he doesn't quite understand yet.  The daughter however is like pin point.  She's angry and doesn't seem to give Isabelle [Roberts] a chance.  When Isabelle brings home a puppy to try and win her love, she exclaims she's allergic to dogs but is actually lying.  She doesn't want Isabelle to think she is giving her any part of her.  She ""hates"" her.  The movie is mainly focused on how Anna hates Isabelle and how they bond.  The unrealistic part is how Roberts character and Sarandon's character coexist towards the end.  I'm not saying it could never happen but it's a little over the top.  In all, this is a good family film, a good movie for people going through that type of situation, I somewhat wished I had seen it before or while I was going through the same thing.",4.0
"Stepmom may not be a definate classic but It will be remembered as a sad sad movie.  It is one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen.  Susan Sarandon gave what should've been an Academy Award nominated performance as a single mom battling cancer.  Julia Roberts has another good performance as well as Ed Harris.  The film does move you and make you feel lucky.  It isn't my favorite, but for anyone who loved Terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolias this is the movie for you.",4.0
"I saw this movie one weekend recently, and at first, I thought it was a bit boring.  Then, I just relaxed and I was amazed by the acting chemistry between all of the characters.  The story was a bit typical for any movie like this.  The kids did a really good job.  They acted as though they've been in the business since before they were born.  Definitely a great movie, but make sure you have plenty of tissues, because you will cry!",4.0
"This movie is about divorces. Ben and Anna play these two kids who's parents are divorced. Anna is determined to make her new stepmom, Isabelle, life miserable. I can't tell you anymore, it would ruin the movie, but yes, it does have a happy eding.. sort of.",4.0
"I actually got this DVD, plus four others, for free! It was part of a special deal that I got with the purchase of my Toshiba DVD player.  It sat around my house for a few months before I finally opened it and played it.  I had been a little reluctant to see it because, even though it stars one of my favorite actresses--Susan Sarandon, it looked like a stereotypical oversentimentalized ""chick flick."" I was pleasantly surprised.
There is not one false note in this movie.  The screenplay, courtesy of a whopping FIVE writers (which usually spells disaster for most movies), sticks very close to reality.  We get a sense that these characters are three-dimensional and REAL, and not merely functions of the plot.  The tension between the estranged wife (played by Sarandon) and the title character (played by Julia Roberts) is palpable and believable, with no one being made the saint nor the villian.  These characters have virtues and faults just like anybody else. They also have clear reasons and MOTIVATIONS for the way they feel, and for the things they do.  Ed Harris, as the man standing between the woman he loves and the woman he once loved (and still cares very much for), also rings true in his performance and makes us feel the inner tensions felt by his character.  I even liked the two young actors playing the kids, and the way their parts were written: these are real kids with real feelings and emotions, and are not just there to look and act cute.  They are caught in an uncomfortable situation not of their making, and we really feel for them.
Although the last half-hour does reflect certain conventions of Hollywood dramas (""Terms of Endearment"" comes to mind, a little bit anyway), STEPMOM never falls into cliche` territory.  It deals with the situation bravely, and doesn't lose its step.  By the end of the film, I felt like I knew these characters and cared about them, because they contained aspects of real people I have known.
Basically, if you like to watch a good family-centered drama every once in a while, then I definitely recommend this movie.  It is definitely better than most others of its type.",4.0
"Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon light up the screen in ""Stepmom,"" a heartwarming and emotionally involving comedy/drama which tells the story of two women, one divorced, the other married to her ex-husband, and the hurdles they must jump in order to find a common ground of understanding. The movie has it laughs, tears, and an upbeat attitude that keeps going throughout, telling its story in an appealing fashion with the help of its brilliant cast and director Chris Columbus. You can enjoy this movie for everything it has to offer and feel satisfied in the end with how you spent your time; I did.
Jackie and Luke are divorced, which is emotionally taxing on their two children, Anna and Ben, Anna refusing to accept the fact that her parents are never getting back together again. Ben is too young to understand much of what is going on; he merely aides Anna in making Luke's girlfriend, Isabel, completely miserable. This includes hounding her for unwashed laundry, putting down her lunches, and just about anything they can to make it look like they have been treated with less care than they would under their mother. The movie's setup of these relationships between different characters is well-done, keeping its focus on the children's actions and their feelings on the situations they are put into.
As most ex-wives will do, Jackie is condescending of Isabel, looking down on her as a self-centered woman who cares more for her work and personal life than for the children under her care. They have many sparring sessions and heated arguments, but it's clear that they cannot argue forever, and as the children begin to warm to Isabel, so does the friendship between Jackie and Isabel begin to form. Soon, they are helping each other through tough times, trading tips on caring for the children, but still maintaining that small spark of conflict which will surface time and again as Jackie realizes her children are no longer solely under her influence.
The movie deals with a lot of real-to-life family issues that will hit home with most viewers and is sure to strike an emotional chord in audiences everywhere. One of those issues is the fact that a divorce is more about how to deal with the children than about getting on with life. The movie does not take away the focus from the childrens' feelings towards their situation. At one point, Anna stands up and shouts, ""You didn't ask me if I wanted a new mother!"" The story is still about the feud between Jackie and Isabel, but this feud centers around what each of them feels is best for the children, keeping with the fact that in a divorce, they are the ones who are most affected.
Actors Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, Anna and Ben, do a terrific job in bringing out all of that emotion and feeling in their characters. Aiken's character is not required to be as emotional as Malone's: he is only eight years old in the movie, and does not clearly understand what his parents are going through. He is merely along for the ride, going with what his parents say and what his sister wants, and Aiken brings all of that childhood innocence out perfectly and with believability. Malone must provide a much more involved role: her character is older, and lashes out against her father for leaving his mother and preparing to be with a woman half his age. Malone is full of tears, anger, and laughs, and her performance is heartwrenching and convincing.
Another issue is embedded in the relationship between Jackie and Isabel. Jackie has the maternal instinct where Isabel is trying her best, and the story is intensified emotionally by the clashes in how they feel the children should be raised. When Jackie realizes that Isabel is going to be a permanent part of her children's lives, she also comes to the realization that she cannot keep arguing with her about how to raise the children. As they come to an understanding of one another, it's intriguing to watch the two actresses interact onscreen.
Susan Sarandon is plays Jackie, who is stubborn and becomes quite disturbed when Isabel steps onto her turf. She brings out all this emotion and feeling, as well as her actions and reactions, convincingly, matching the performance of Roberts, her opposite. Roberts is Isabel, and she brings all the brightness and charm of her own person into the role while also maintaining a short emotional fuse. It is easy to see that the two actresses are having fun in their roles, and their pairing for this movie is outstanding. Their performances make this one of the best movies of the year. Ed Harris plays the part of Luke, who knows how Jackie feels but wishes that she and Isabel would be able to come to an understanding of one another. His performance is earnest and warming, and like his costars, he makes his role believable and interesting.
""Stepmom"" is one of those feel-good movies that was able to keep my interest throughout. There is a twist in the plot that I dare not even mention, because the filmmakers and producers have done a pretty good job of not giving it away in the promotional material. There is a lot of love between the characters, brought out by the stellar cast and a director whose films in this field have excelled. Based on emotional depth and connectivity, ""Stepmom"" is a nice piece of heart that is filled with true human feeling.",4.0

"This movie is a tough one to watch because many of the scenes (especially during the first hour) are riddled with tension -- the kind you feel when you've just confronted someone head-on.  Everyone fights  -- parents,  children, ex-wife and girlfriend, stepmother and children; you almost feel  like you've been inadvertantly caught with a friend when she decides to  have a major argument with a family member  -- makes you want to slip out  of the room until the storm is over.
Chris Columbus did a wonderful job  directing this film -- the arguments were uncomfortable, but they were  supposed to be.  Better, there were some poignant moments that really  worked.  STEPMOM is a realistic fable with just a touch of magic to make  the audience happy.
The cast was superb -- Julia Roberts and Susan  Sarandon gave great performances, and the kids (not sure of their names)  were both adorable and the biggest brats you've ever seen -- a great  combination.  Ed Harris was curiously absent from the film, showing up in  less than half the scenes.
This movie is everything a drama is supposed  to be: funny, moving, difficult, sad.  Chris Columbus captured some  beautiful moments, and some hard ones as well, making the audience better  for the journey.",4.0

"""Nothing in Common"" is Tom Hanks' first dramatic role (though there are plenty of comedic moments) and Jackie Gleason's last movie role.  Both do a fine job as a father and son who really have no use and less understanding of each other.  Of course, there is a crisis (actually a series of crises) that forces them to choose further alienation or reconciliation.  You will have to watch the movie to find out - and I encourage you to do so.

Tom Hanks plays David Basner, a young and talented up-and-coming ad executive.  He is in all ways the flower of the YUPPIE ethos including the pre-AIDS casual attitude towards sex and relationships.  Gleason plays Max Basner who is a way past his prime manufacturers rep for a children's clothes manufacturer.  Max is by all accounts a difficult and angry man who used to be quite a charmer and ladies man.

Eva Marie Saint plays Lorraine Basner.  Lorraine was trapped into a marriage some would call loveless, but it is much more complicated than that.  Again, you will have to watch the movie to learn all the subtleties, but during the film she decides to break free and ""find herself"" by walking out of her home and marriage to file for divorce and get the first job of her life.  Both Max and Lorraine begin relying on David in ways that reverse the parent - child relationship and put a real strain and the solo life and upward career path David is enjoying.

To complete the sea of troubles, David is in the middle of trying to land a huge airline deal for his firm that would likely make him a partner and has also developed a mutual attachment with Cheryl Ann Wayne (played by the amazing Sela Ward) who is important on the airline account for multiple reasons.  Plus, there is the old friend who really needs to be more, Donna Martin, played wonderfully by Bess Armstrong.

Some have criticized the movie as having two minds.  The stuff at the office is fun, raucous, aggressive, and often very funny.  The Basner family saga is often very painful.  I actually found the clash of these two stories more or less realistic.  Many young professionals experience a much different life at work than at home and that leads to a lot of stress, broken marriages, and lots of counseling hours.

While I am not thrilled with all the choices the characters make along the way, I do think the movie ends in a good place - though some might find it maudlin.  In my view, the character that comes off best is Charlie Gargas, David's Boss, played by the always effective Hector Elizondo.

Other reasons to view the film again are the very young and pre- Homer Simpson Dan Castellaneta, the now strange 80's fashions, and the wonderful exchanges between David Basner and the deadpan secretary, and Conrad Janis on trombone with his jazz band (however briefly).

I think the best reason to see the film is the performance delivered by Jackie Gleason.  It is a tour de force of how to provide humanity to such an unsympathetic character.  There is much subtlety and skill in his portrayal of Max Basner and it is very memorable.",4.0
"I've watched this movie dozens of times, and was overjoyed to find it on DVD at last.  This was (I believe) The Great One Jackie Gleason's final screen performance, and it showed the way of the future for Tom Hanks.  Sela Ward also appears as a love interest, along with Hector Elizondo as his boss, and Eva Marie Saint as Hanks' mom.

The only thing that gets on my nerves just a little is the soundtrack.  I think it's Christopher Cross, surely one of the most annoying alleged musicians ever to hit the big time.

The transfer to disk is good.  The cast is excellent.  The plot makes sense, and the script is near perfect.  The story is about the relationship between Tom Hanks' character, David Basner, and his father, Max Basner.  Its a wonder that anyone comes out right as an adult, and Hanks had no idea how screwed up his childhood had been until the night his father told him his mother had split.  And soon thereafter his secretary gave him a message that his mother had called, and added ""I had no idea you had parents.""

Wonderful.  Buy it, enjoy it.",4.0

"I haven't seen the DVD version yet but I enjoyed the theater release very much (saw it twice).
I thought it was one of Arnold's best movies, in fact. I couldn't understand why it got such bad reviews.
Maybe they  missed the point of all the self-mocking sarcasm? Arnold got a chance to  relax and make some serious fun of himself and his image.
It's a great  fantasy, where a kid is sucked into the movie screen, into the world of his  favorite action hero movie star. And then he tries to convince the hero  that the hero's world is just a fiction in the movies.
Like, the hero  gets someone's phone number and the kid points out, so if this is all real,  then how come everybody's phone number starts with ""555""?
And  they're in a video store and they see a poster for a movie that starred  Arnold in real life. Only in the hero's world, it starred Sylvester  Stallone, and the hero says how much he loved Stallone's performance.
I  really think the naysayers just missed the whole point. It really stood up  to my 2nd viewing and I will check out the DVD version soon.",4.0

"A very young Tom Hanks stars as David, an up and coming ad executive in Chicago who plays hard and works hard. He has just been promoted to a window office, and  everything seems to be going perfectly until his father, played by Jackie Gleason, announces that his mother, played by Eva Marie Saint, has moved out. Jackie Gleason plays himself - a cigar chewing, joking, clothing salesman who has lost his edge and can no longer adapt to new sales methods and is losing clients until the firm eventually fires him.

David walks the tightrope between his grumpy, ailing father and his mother who wants to start a new life with someone who will love and pay attention to her. He finds out more about their relationship than he ever wanted to know in some rather emotional scenes.

Out of a sense of responsibility, Hanks tries to take care of his father, urging him to go to the doctor for his failing eyesight. Meanwhile, Hanks is working on a campaign for a major airlines and wooing the sexy hard-working daughter of the chairman of the airlines. He is torn between the demands of his job and his family, though his dad is irascible and demanding and ungrateful and his mother can't forgive his father for a lifetime of neglect and antipathy.

David learns a lot from his parents' marriage and from the other relationships in his life and matures considerably throughout the film. By the end, he's more than just a womanizing, hard-charging prankster ad executive. The ensemble cast (Eva Marie Saint,  Hector Elizondo,  Barry Corbin,  Bess Armstrong,  Sela Ward,) is quite impressive, ensuring that watching this nearly 30 year old film will be an enjoyable experience. However, I had to wince at the hair and make-up and clothing styles of the 80's - did I really wear such huge shoulder pads?  I'm sure I did !",4.0

I remember when I was a kid and this came out the same summer as Jurassiac Park which was a massive box office hit while this was considered a flop at the time. It's really to bad because it captures the action crazed movies of the eighties and early nineties so well. Some great moments and set pieces and I am huge Schwarzenegger fan so in my books he can do no wrong. The only one issue is the main character of the kid can get pretty annoying at times. That being said this is a forgotten action masterpiece.,4.0

"Before he went all soporific on everybody. Before he made the ill-advised ""Philadelphia"" and then the cleverer ""Forrest Gump"", Hanks was actually a fairly broad comic actor. Some of his movies hit the mark, like ""Splash"" and ""The Money Pit"", and others bombed badly, like ""The Man With One Red Shoe"" and ""Bachelor Party"". He was great at playing overly-confident, affable yuppies that were almost always put-upon in the extreme or finding themselves in odd situations, like he did in this one.

In this movie, Hanks plays David Basner, a hotshot adman in Chicago, with comical co-workers and upper-middle-aged parents that are breaking up. While he tries romancing the daughter of a major client, (Sela Ward, hubba-hubba!) he also has to deal with his poor father (Jackie Gleason) losing his wife of 40 years and his job, all within the same month! The ""tough love"" tenderness Basner uses with his dad is offset by the kid gloves he uses with his mother, played by Eva Marie Saint. There are some ingenious comic scenes in this film, such as the ad company presentation to the Texan airline owner client, father of the Sela Ward character, (the woman with the guitar voicing the old lady on the plane is priceless,) and some other ad proposals are done well too. However, it is the later scenes with Max, his father, that will probably get to you the most. This was Jackie Gleason's last movie, and it is LIGHT YEARS better than most of the stuff he starred in late in his career, specifically the ""Smokey & The Bandit"" movies and ""The Sting II"". Hanks would go on to make ""Joe Versus The Volcano"", which was really Meg Ryan's movie more than his, his last broad comedy, and then made ""A League of Their Own"", which changed his career as well as saved it. There was no looking back after ""Philadelphia"", which was actually his first totally dramatic role.

Frankly, I kinda miss the affable yuppy Hanks and would love to see him in another ""Money Pit"".

"The Deep End of the Ocean is a weepy drama but thanks to Michelle Pfeiffer's brilliant and realistic performance, I didn't mind it at all. I have never seen Pfeiffer give an average performance and I am including Grease 2, lol. The film is somewhat average but a lot of families deal with a child been abducted so I think a lot of people could relate to this film. Treat Williams and Whoopi Goldberg also star, they are great too in this. I am rating this film rather high because of Pfeiffer, she's one of my favorites!",4.0

This man can act! He did a superb job. This movie is definitely worth watching.",4.0
"As a parent, I could certainly empathize with the mother.  Losing a child is definitely a concern most parents have from time to time.
Once it was realized that Ben lived down the street, the emotions began to arise again.  In me, this time, it was more for the child than the parent.  While, I still wanted Ben to be reunited with his family, you have to stop and think of the emotions this child is going through.
As a three-year-old, he loses his mom when he is abducted.  Then, the ""mother"" that reared him committed suicide, so he lost his mom a second time.  Then when his natural parents find him, he is taken away from the ""dad"" that reared him.  I cannot begin to imagine the confusion going through his mind.
I felt the portrayal of the DSS (Department of Social Services) was rather good.  In my opinion, they were portrayed as being cold and heartless.  While there are many in the DSS who are not heartless, the general trend of the agency is cold.  The DSS needed to spend time working with this teen to acclimate him to the news that his ""dad"" was not actually his father and that he had been abducted as a child.  They needed to work with him through his grief and work out a solution on how he could see the man who did rear him for so many years, who also was a victim in this situation.
The story would have been stronger if it dealt more with the emotions of the child/teen and less with the mother.  Most people, especially parents, can easily see her pain, but Ben's was overlooked in parts.
I would highly recommend the movie.  Be committed to seeing it through as there are some slow parts.",4.0
"The Deep End of the Ocean is a drama about child/stranger abduction.  The Cappadora's are a family of five living in Wisconsin.  The mother, Beth (played by Michelle Phillips), is a photographer.  One fall day, she and her three children Vincent (5), Ben (3), and Carrie (a few months old) take a weekend trip to Chicago to attend her class reunion.  Beth and the children arrive at the hotel, where she is greeted by many past and present friends.  Amongst all the chaos and excitement in the lobby, Ben was kidnapped while Vincent was supposed to be watching him.  Pat, Beth's husband (played by Treet Williams), was notified and immediately went to Beth's side.  Beth remained in Chicago for two months while Pat returned to Wisconsin with Vincent and Carrie.  While Beth was in Chicago, she became close to a police detective named Candy Bliss (played by Whoopi Goldberg), basically living at the police station.  Beth finally returned home after two months of staying in Chicago.  Pat was the backbone of the family by taking care of the children and the family business while Beth fell deeper into depression.  Even though she has two children that need her to love them, she can only think of Ben and how she lost him.  The story moves ahead nine years.  Pat opened a new restaurant in Chicago, where they moved to two years before.  Beth started taking pictures again and appears to have adjusted to their life without Ben.  Carrie was now nine years old and Vincent was a teenager with many behavioral problems.  Life moved on until one day a boy knocked on their door asking if he could mow their yard.  Beth froze in disbelief.  Beth took a few pictures of him, while he mowed the yard and compared them to the pictures to the age-progression picture that the police had made of Ben.  The pictures looked identical.  Life turned upside-down again.  The police, Beth, Pat, and Candy went to Ben's home.  Ben's ""father"", George Karras, didn't understand what was happening because he had legally adopted Ben.  Actually, he adopted Sam, Ben's new name.  This plot in the story is astonishing since Beth doesn't know the identity of the abductor and George didn't realize that Ben was kidnapped.  Moving Ben into the Cappadora's home is stressful on the whole family.  Many conflicting emotions between Beth and Pat surface as they search for a way to reconnect with the child they had lost.  Vincent and Carrie sit in the background while Beth and Pat focus on their relationship with Ben.  The attention Ben gets from everyone adds stress to the already strained relationship between him and Vincent.  Ben tries to stay open to the possibilities and doesn't want to close any doors.  He wants to keep his relationship with George, but Beth and Pat make it virtually impossible.  Ben doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings but wants happiness for himslf also.  At the end of the movie, everyone seems to relax as the light at the end of the tunnel gets closer.  A serene, calm atmosphere absorbs the last scene as Ben and Vincent finally connect.  This story has many sides.  When Beth loses Ben, the pain she felt makes your heart heavy.  Any mother can only imagine how that feels.  Watching it happen to someone else is painful but the thought of that happening to your own child is overwhelming.  A joyful side of this movie is when Ben is found.  The excitement, the wonder, and the anticipation of Sam being Ben, was a high point of the movie.  He had been two blocks away for two years.  A simple knock on the door changed their lives again.  The section of the movie that included Sam was a little slow.  Beth, Pat, and Ben (Sam) seemed to be living the same way for months with no noticeable progress.  This made this movie seem to last longer than what it really needed to be.  An aspect that could have made this movie more realistic is Ben's personality.  He is an extremely mature twelve-year old.  His reactions were too optimistic and cheerful most of the time.  I think that the typical teenager in this situation would have rebelled or become more isolated.  If Ben had been more confused, perhaps his reactions would have been easier to sympathize with.  I didn't feel a connection with Ben.  Even though he was one of the main characters, I didn't feel any kind of relationship with him.  This story is divided into two sections.  The first part is from the abduction through three or four months following the abduction.  This part pulls on your emotions of how you would cope with the loss of your child.  It's as if Ben were dead but not knowing exactly if he is or not is worse.  The second half deals with the return of Ben and how the family including Ben copes with this adjustment.  The twists in this half seem to fade compared to the first half.  The struggles and accomplishments appear to compliment each other but without a climax.  The family pushes each other away but together at the end.  There's not a huge event or tragedy that brings them back together.  This movie is what I would call a ""chick-flick"" in regards to the story following the mother's perspective.  It really calls to mother's emotions.  It brings the viewer to a level that is uncomfortable and to a situation that only happens to other children, not yours.  ""What if my child was kidnapped?"" is a powerful statement.  This movie makes you examine your own habits or practices and what you would do in the same situation.  I left this movie realizing that I could be Beth.  Even though this is only a movie, it has an underlying message about how child abduction only takes a second.",4.0
"""The Deep End of the Ocean"" is one of the best movies of 1999, complex and moving, with truly emotional characters played by actors who carry the weight of the story on their shoulders with incredible ease and make it heartwarming and believable. The movie is actually two different stories, one being a family's emotional coming-to-terms with a missing child, and then the pain and stress they must endure when he shows up nine years later.
On her way to her high school reunion, Beth Cappadora is told by her husband that if her head wasn't attached to her, she would lose it quickly. This provides a short laugh, while also setting up what is to come. At the reunion, she leaves her three-year-old son Ben in the care of his older brother Vincent, only to come back moments later and realize that he is gone. Hysterics grow, and after a thorough search of the building, he is nowhere to be found. Surrounded by family and friends, Beth begins to cope with her mistake as the community gets involved in the search for Ben, without success. Resigned to the fact that he will never be found, she returns home, and while the first steps to coping with what has happened are rocky, the family seems to be getting along well after the passage of nine years. They have moved to a new house in a new town, her husband has the restaurant he always wanted... A knock on the door turns everything upside down. Beth immediately recognizes the boy as her son, and is relieved and confused that he lives only two blocks away from their new residence. The authorities get involved, and soon Ben is taken from the only home he can remember and placed in a new and somewhat emotionally frightening setting where he is called by a name he does not know and lives with people he does not remember or feel much for.
What makes this movie work for me is the complexity of the story as well as the characters, and the magnificence in which the two blend together. The first part of the story admittedly is the more believable of the two, diving into the emotions of the family as they must cope with the grief of the missing Ben. Beth's reaction to her son's disappearance is superbly acted out by Michelle Pheiffer, who carries it like she's been through it in reality. The first half of the movie shows her dealing with the pain in the only way she knows how: shutting everyone else out, ignoring the optimism of life that is to be explored. This causes her to become somewhat distanced from her husband, played by Treat Williams, and her oldest son, who feels the great weight of responsibility set in when he must take care of his little sister while his parents argue.
The second half of the movie is the more emotional of the two, however, as the family, who is just beginning to enjoy life, find their son and bring him back home. There is an unmistakable truth in what occurs emotionally between the two brothers, Vincent and Ben, who goes by Sam. Vincent, who has just begun to gain the attention he never got from his parents, feels threatened by the presence of Ben, and does everything he can to make his long-lost sibling feel unwelcome. This, accompanied by the emotional baggage toted by the family in their struggle to be happy together all conspire to make the movie more heartfelt, warming and true.
Some of the best acting talent ever has gone into the making of this movie, which is heavily called for considering the amount of emotion that needs to be conveyed to the audience. Michelle Pheiffer is Beth Cappadora, and in this role, she is literally required to become her character. She does this with superb talent, playing Beth as an overall emotional person with a strong will hidden beneath her sorrows. Treat Williams makes the perfect supportive husband, as well as a father who just wants things to be like he always imagined for his family. Ben's return has a big effect on him, and when he puts his foot down about what the family does together, the acting is nothing short of amazing. Jackson does a great job in playing the older brother Vincent, as well as the wild-child teenager who gets into a lot of trouble. Whoopi Goldberg seems like a stretch as the detective working the case, but she works the camera as well with her serious demeanor.
Complexity and integrity are what make a movie worth watching, and ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" has all of this and more. The fact that the plot is basically two parts should not be a deference from the film; believe me, the story rolls right along. Dynamic performances and highly likeable characters also add to the film's appeal. What more can you ask for?",4.0

"I'll confess that when I saw ""Last Action Hero"" in the theater, I hated it. It may have been because my expectation were for a shoot-'em up action flick, and as the film played out, I realized it was a comedy taking jabs at what was then my teenage self's favorite genre, I was irritated. More likely, it was because my brother and I went to see this at it's Midnight opening, and I was simply tired and cranky by the time the film started playing?! Either way, it wasn't a movie I revisited for quite some time. Flash ahead a few years, and I see it on the shelf at Blockbuster (remember those?...there's one in this movie even!) and decide to give it another viewing. Upon second viewing, I enjoyed the movie much more, and now it stands right up there with some of Schwarzenegger's best films.

The basic story is that a young boy is given a magic ticket, the ticket allows the boy to enter the latest film of his favorite action star Jack Slater. While helping Jack thwart crime in LA, he's also trying to convince Slater that they are both in a movie by pointing out things like one cop being an animated cat, or guns that never run out of bullets. Slater doesn't buy it, but when an evil henchman steals the ticket to come into the real world, it's up to Slater to stop him and get the ticket back.

The kid is pretty weak, but there are few child actors that aren't hard to take in anything other than small doses. The fact that this film doesn't get more credit is a real shame. We are, after all, talking about a film directed by the man who brought us Die Hard, Predator, and The Hunt For Red October, and written by the man who wrote Lethal Weapon and wrote/directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

"As a movie, Last Action Hero is a very underrated film that parodies the kinds of action movies it was originally marketed as. Audiences didn't expect a comedy when they went to see it and walked out angry. Columbia made the mistake of thinking Arnold could hold his own (and win) against competing picture Jurassic Park, which opening the same weekend (Arnold didn't fare well)

As for the DVD, I would recommend going the way of Mill Creek's recent re-release. This is mostly because Columbia's DVD is in full screen, which makes it undesirable. Mill Creek's DVD is in widescreen, the transfer is good, and the artwork is the original artwork (Columbia's wasn't). The only draw is the the DVD is even more bare-bones than Columbia, a fact I didn't think was possible. The menu has nothing but a play option. Either way, I would recommend this disc over Columbia's simply for the fact that it finally shows the film in widescreen, as it rightfully deserved.",4.0
"Last Action Hero is certainly not for everyone. To me, there is no truer evidence of this than when I saw it that fateful summer it was released (and completely overshadowed by Jurassic Park) and I left the theater in love with it, while my friends wondered if it was the stupidest Arnold movie they had ever seen. It was certainly unlike anything Arnold had been in before.

And this is the curse of Last Action Hero - an ironic twist on who Arnold was, a commentary on action genre, a love-letter to action movies, and completely self-referential as it embodied everything it was putting under the microscope. It was a movie too ironic and self referential for its time, and in 2014, it covers a topic that is a cloudy mystery to this generation, as the action hero (the Stallones and Arnolds) is something that doesn't exist as it did when this movie was made. So where does that leave Last Action Hero? Under appreciated? Romanticized? Probably a lot of both.

Now, with that out of the way, here is what Last Action Hero is to me: A fun, well-written summer movie that has a little extra depth, asks a few good questions about what we expect from movies. It's the 'Cabin In The Woods' of action movies. It's Hot Fuzz played out literally. Even the AV Club thinks it deserves a second look (http://www.avclub.com/article/whyi-last-action-heroi-failedand-why-it-deserves-t-105120)

"A movie should be entertaining.  Last Action Hero is all that and some.  Due the plausibility is about a 2 on a 1000 scale, but nothing about this film was meant to be anything other than a laugh.

Last Action Hero really shouldn't have been the flop it was.  Even 20 years later this movie, in spite of being dated, is a laugh.

"This movie was billed as an action flick during its theater release, which was a mistake. Audiences were expecting exactly that, and the movie is something entirely different: it's a comedy, and a clever one, at that.

Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger) is the favorite action hero of young movie buff, Danny Madigan. A magic movie ticket and a wrinkle in reality transport Danny into Slater's world, where car chases are a daily event and Slater's never-before-seen police partner turns out to be a cartoon cat named Whiskers. Slater and Danny fight crime while dodging action-movie cliches right and left. Then, in a nod to meta, they hunt down a Slater-world villain who has crossed into the real world and is attempting to defeat Slater once and for all by killing the actor who portrays him.

The movie doesn't just mock the cliches of its genre, it mocks movies themselves. Slater's closet only contains identical versions of the same clothes he's already wearing. The police captain's unintelligible scolding is revealed to be exactly that: even up close and in person, you still can't tell exactly what he's saying.

Slater is forced to realize that he and his world (where all phone numbers start with 555) are fictional. He immediately becomes angry about all the stresses and hardships he's suffered at the all-too-casual whims of writers.

There are lots of great details in this movie (the daydreamed Jack Slater version of ""Hamlet"" is priceless), and several talented character actors: Mercedes Ruehl, Charles Dance, Robert Prosky, and F. Murray Abraham all make appearances here.

If you like irony and satire, this movie is definitely worth seeing. Here's hoping it finds the right audience on DVD, now that the studio has stopped trying to pass it off as something different from what it actually is.",4.0
"It's sad to think that 18 years after its release Last Action Hero is still trying to find its target audience. Audiences don't like smart movies. Or perhaps I should say audiences don't like to be OUTSMARTED by movies. In the summer of 1993 the world was going crazy for a certain dinosaur movie, almost everything else didn't stand a chance. LAH came out a week after Jurassic Park. The only people who really went to see it were those who were too late for sold-out screenings of Spielberg's movie. Bad word of mouth spread for many reasons.

Those lucky enough to actually see it on the big screen walked away confused and disorientated. They thought they were in for a straight-up action movie, not an existential, meta-fictional parody of the genre they cherish. It was just too much and they weren't ready for it. Arnold had been riding the wave of Total Recall and Terminator 2 before the release of Last Action Hero, no one expected such a radical deviation from the norm.

Danny Madigan is a lonely kid living in a tiny New York apartment with his single MILF. His only friend is Nick, an old-time projectionist at a run down theater (a REAL theater, no multiplex nonsense). Danny likes to escape into the world of action movies, his biggest hero, obviously, being Arnie himself. The latest Arnie blockbuster, the simply-titled Jack Slater IV, is a day away from its premiere, and old Nick has been tasked with checking the print. Before Danny sits down for his own personal pre-premiere midnight screening Nick gives him a magical ticket he's been saving since childhood. Five minutes after Jack Slater IV begins Danny is warped into the cinema screen and becomes part of the movie.

In the movie world Danny quickly learns that the laws of physics and simple logic don't apply (how often has THAT proven to be true?). He's partnered with Slater, a renegade L.A. cop and the absolute zenith of action hero stereotypes, to find who killed his favorite second-cousin Frank (BIG MISTAKE!). Danny and Slater smash their way into a hokey, James Bond-ish plot, though it's not long before suave English henchman Mr. Benedict discovers Danny's secret and plans to escape to the real world. Danny and Slater follow, but Slater's movie-world abilities are rendered useless in reality. Doubt begins seep in for the first time as he ends up questioning his powers as a good cop.

Last Action Hero scores huge points all round. It's technically wonderful, with gorgeous anamorphic Panavision photography full of wide angles and lens flares. The writing is sharp is funny. Arnie is great as an infallible hero in crisis as well as making fun of his screen persona. And the action, both fictional and meta-fictional, is wild, overblown, and exciting. I just love Slater's huge fall from the elevator.

It's interesting to note that it has a lot in common with Loaded Weapon, which came out earlier that year. Both are send-ups of the 'L.A. cop movie' genre, both star F. Murray Abraham in supporting roles. Both feature Frank McRae as a screaming Lieutenant. Both have obvious Die Hard references (also directed by the infamous John McTiernan).

The bad reputation is unjustified. The financial loss was a mistake entirely on Sony's part and their lack of foresight into the 1993 summer season. Last Action Hero and Jurassic Park went head-to-head with their advertising but the dinosaur movie's marketing campaign was just too groundbreaking. They also competed with each other on a technical level. JP was the first film to feature DTS sound, while Last Action Hero was the first to feature SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound), an eight-channel system that delivers every decibel of Slater's big gun and the multiple explosions of his daily life.

It may be a satire, but Last Action Hero just may be one of the last true action films. Real stunts, real explosions, real destruction, reality gone twisted. It's Arnold's most subversive movie, and it's many things, but bad ain't one of them.

The Blu Ray features a great 2.35:1 1080p picture with a loud DTS HD-MA soundtrack. Zero extras are included. Sony seems to still be ashamed of the film. The hate is not deserved.",4.0
"Here we are, closing in on 20 years after this movie's release and people STILL don't understand: this isn't an action movie, it's an action movie parody-basically one long in-joke. I saw this in a theater back in 1993 and loved it, because it wasn't meant to be taken seriously; it's Arnie lampooning himself (I'm Arnold Braunschweiger!) during his comedy movie era with other jokes tossed in. It doesn't always work, but it's great fun and this blu-ray was a long overdue re-release, even if it is bare-bones.",4.0
"Like a large percentage of Arnold Schwarzenegger's work, this is a film with a strong fantasy/altered reality element to it that works quite well overall, despite at times seeming too beholden to action formulae, rather than being willing to take the fantastic risks it looks like it's going to.  John McTiernan's 1993 LAST ACTION HERO was roundly criticized at the time of its release for being overblown and not delivering the goods that were expected from a $70-90 million (a lot of money at the time) film.  It came in the wake of TERMINATOR II, a hard act to follow certainly, and also just after McTiernan's financially disappointing MEDICINE MAN - but with his big hit THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER still reasonably fresh.  More importantly, the director had gotten his big break with PREDATOR, which was an important step in Arnold's rise to superstardom; this was their first (and to date only) reteaming.  I suppose expectations were higher than any film could deliver, and when the film failed to ignite either critics or the box office (to be fair, it was always in the mighty shadow of JURASSIC PARK), the word ""flop"" started to get bandied about, and the cynics started to wonder of the star's decade of dominance was coming to an end.

The naysayers were partly right; this was the first sign of Arnold faltering, though it would take another five years before he really started to lose his lustre; and it wasn't his best film by a long shot, though it certainly looks pretty good now in comparison with some of his later, even more expensive and less successful outings like END OF DAYS.  Basically the idea here is that we start off watching ""Jack Slater III"", an Arnold Schwarzenegger cop film in a sort of alternate reality that's pretty close to ours, and then our eventual sidekick character, an adolescent kid named Danny (Austin O'Brien) is revealed as watching the flick in a crumbling and decrepit old NYC movie palace.  The early scenes here are very evocative - Danny is watching the film alone, friends with the old projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky), and his mother (Mercedes Ruehl) worries about him skipping school and only being interested in movies and hanging out with the weird old guy.  Very Zemeckis-Spielberg.  But soon we're in different territory as Nick gives Danny a ""magic ticket"" that he got from Houdini himself, tearing it and releasing the magic that allows Danny to be catapulted into the movie world of Jack Slater (now starring in the 4th installment of the franchise, brand-new and not even officially premiered yet).

So the ""real world"" kid falls in with the completely fake Slater, who is of course unaware that he's a movie character.  There are some pretty good jokes early on - Slater's boss, the blustery Lt Dekker (Frank McRae) gets so angry and abusive if his regular berating of Slater that he becomes completely incomprehensible; Slater never runs out of bullets and never hurts himself; there are cameos from several costars of Arnold's from previous films; cartoon characters work as cops; etc.  But the satire on action movie conventions is fitful and often seems to be used just to fill in the blanks between ""real"" action sequences, and the developing friendship between Danny and Jack, while sweet, just doesn't feel as significant as it should.  Perhaps a Spielberg would have made it too shmaltzy, but here you're left wondering just how Danny really feels about the whole experience once it's over.

Charles Dance does a great one-eyed villain (with a different glass eye for every occasion) and Tom Noonan plays the other villain, something of a slasher-movie type monster called ""Ripper"".  Anthony Quinn is around as a bit as Dance's employer who stupidly keeps making idiomatic malapropisms in the manner of Biff in Back to the Future; we know his minutes are numbered from the get-go.  Art Carney has a nice little cameo as Slater's ""favorite second cousin"" and Bridgette Wilson is there to lend some serious hotness.  There are some nice little specific movie references - Olivier's Hamlet transformed into Jack Slater's (""to be, or not to be...not to be"" as he blows up the castle behind him) and Ian McKellen doing Bergman's death - but overall the satire is outweighed by action setpieces, and the film has a rather slapped-together feel to it, unsure as to what to do other than lumber towards a big splashy finish.

Still, it's mostly fun, and I have to say that I wasn't as bothered by O'Brien as I was on seeing it when new.  I think Arnie was fairly into it also, and that's important.  Probably average for his ouevre, and for all it's faults, another reminder as to why he really was not just the biggest but the best American action star of his era: he had the best talent around him, and he rarely seemed to take his image as seriously as people like Seagal, Stallone and Norris did.",4.0
"What happens when an action movie crosses over into the real world? That's the question explored in the early '90s cult action flick, Last Action Hero.

Young Danny (Austin O'Brian) spends his time watching cheesy action flicks, particularly those by action star Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). When an old projectionist gives Danny a magical ticket, Danny is transported into one of Jack's movies where the laws of physics (or reality) don't have much meaning. It seems like the perfect world for Danny until Jack's nemesis (Charles Dance) finds the magic ticket and enters into the real world. It's up to Danny and Jack to stop him, but without the luxury of movie magic.

While many action movie fans (such as myself) will enjoy the cult nature of this movie, others will find it too corny and tongue-and-cheek. Last Action Hero, while expertly written and executed, is a parody of itself and of all (especially '80s) action movies, but in taking this route, has used too many ""in"" jokes. In fact, a few of the jokes even had to be explained to me, because I didn't understand all the little nuances of the screenplay. I can easily understand why some viewers won't enjoy the film's style of humor, but I can also see how it became a cult classic.

The picture quality is absolutely phenomenal. It's so crisp and clear that, quality-size, it feels like a modern movie. The colors are so vivid that the film feels like it's jumping off the screen (almost literally, making the nature of the movie itself even more interesting). I've never seen this film (okay, so I missed the DVD version and only saw the VHS version) ever presented in such a beautiful way before.

The sound has also been improved, and instead of having to turn the volume way up in order to hear anything outside of the action sequences, it was considerably more manageable. Between the picture and the sound, all of the over-the-top, corny action sequences really came to life here and made me feel like I was part of the action (which seems to be a key aspect of the movie's original intent). Presented in crystal-clear 1080p high definition in 2.40:1 widescreen, this is the best quality Last Action Hero can ever have. This edition also has Spanish, French, and Portuguese audio as well as English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese subtitles.

However, I found the bonus material here (or lack thereof) very disappointing. Now, since I've only see this movie before on VHS, I don't know what was included on the original DVD release (if anything), but I was hoping for a little more in this version of the movie aside from just gorgeous sound and impeccable visuals. Instead, Last Action Hero on Blu-ray features Movie IQ, which allows for semi-annoying (if you haven't seen the movie a few times before) pop-ups that give interesting information about the film, and Blu Live, which seems to be a common feature among all Blu-ray movies meant to direct viewers to Sony's online store. There's no deleted scenes or outtakes (my personal favorite extras) or even interviews with cast and/or crew. While I understand that since this an older movie and keeping up with extra features was very different then, you would think that they could have come up with something.

It's difficult to say whether or not the Blu-ray edition of Last Action Hero is worth it, especially with the serious lack of bonus features and the relatively high price tag associated with Blu-ray disks. If you are looking for flawless video and audio quality, then the Blu-ray is the perfect choice, but if you're looking for new material, then save your money and check out the DVD (or even VHS) version of the movie.",4.0
"Hi Folks,
this is a review of the BLU-RAY edition. This movie was a bit of a financial failure I  believe in its release but I enjoyed it for a fun/dumb action flick!

I actually have the regular DVD edition from the UK which as
1)theatrical trailer
2)a featurette
3) music video featuring AC/DC and Arnold

all fun bonus features and NOT  on the Blu-Ray?

I've deducted a star for the fact that they've delivered a 'bare bones' Blu-ray and besides the ability to carry higher resolution one of the benefits of Blu-Ray is the bigger storage so there is not excuse for having elminated bonus features already produced?

and the Blu-ray on this isn't substantially better than the regular edition to my eyes..I can't recommend an upgrade for the money.",4.0
"Despite a rapid decline in the weekly soundboard routine Sid remains very loyal to the king of pranks himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger. For years we have been blessed with so many laughs and enjoyment from our bulky headed California governor that we felt the need to get another one of his films in. At this point the pickings are very slim since we pounded away at the Arnold market for a year straight in 07. However we were reminded that Last Action Hero still lies in wait and luckily our friend on-demand just happened to have it available.

Our film starts off with young Arnold movie obsessed Danny Madigan as he hangs around at his local movie theater. He's a regular and has befriended the boss from Mrs. Doubtfire who moonlights as the theater owner, who invites Danny to a secret midnight screening of the new Jack Slater movie. Sounds a bit to catch a predator sketchy but the old man checks out and was not just ""some old guy wanting to perv you out."" Somehow the ticket Danny receives is magic and transports him into the back of Arnold caddie. From there he tags along everywhere in a world where the movies are a reality.

For us the film was worth of four star rating off the two simple facts that Eclipse is the first face you see on screen and Apache from the immortal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;makes an appearance. Yeah that's right Apache, awesome. That also lead us to believe Arnold is a big fan of Apache's work since he also had him play the exact same driver role in Predator. Yeah you have no idea what we're talking about but you'll just have to say ""well I'm not used to that but that's fine."" Unfortunately Sid was on the cusp of quite a nerve racking situation thanks to the real life 40 year old virgin and couldn't enjoy Last Action Hero quite as much as we wanted. Despite that the movie was a laugh riot filled with soundboard lines and goofy dialogue. It's one worth checking out for the Arnold enthusiasts out there.",4.0

"Im one of those few people who got the joke. I got the joke back in 1993 when it came out. I know that this movie was meant to spoof those absurd action movies.

Premise: Daniel gets a magic ticket from a movie store owner given to him by Houdini. While watching the latest Jack Slater movie, Daniel gets transported into the movie itself and ends up joining Jack Slater(played by Arnold) in his crazy adventures. This particular adventure involves Jack finding out the killer of his brother.

Opinion: There are plenty of good things to say about this movie and a few bad things to say about this movie. The action is plentiful and the sets look great. That kid is annoying little wimp though. The humor hits(the outlandish stunts, shooting TNT away with bullets, the hackneyed catchphrases, a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc)as well as misses(Slater's daughter screaming like an idiot while thrashing a bad guy in her room and the cartoon police cat WTF?). My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid. Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is! You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife, dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing? What a wuss! Besides these flaws, this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up. A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks.",4.0
"First off, this edition of the film is a double sided dvd which contains the widescreen and full screen versions of the film.  This edition is hard to find because it looks EXACTLY like the release which only contains the full screen version.  Rather than pay $35 for the widescreen version of the film from a seller on amazon, you should go to hastings and sift through there copies looking on the back at the small box below arnold. It should say ""widescreen or standard formats"".  I got my copy for $6.99.  Nothing against amazon, but the few individual sellers trying to charge a fortune for this film are just trying to make a cheap buck.  Amazon itself is the best place on the web or off to buy dvds.

As far as the film itself, the first half is absolutely awesome arnold-tastic action, but the second half get kinda dull.  The first makes it worth adding to any action collection.  Ice cream cone to the skull.",4.0

I've been fortunate enough to procure a beautiful widescreen version of the film in NTSC. Its wonderful being able to see the film the way it should be seen!

Last Action Hero (1993)

****

This is a fascinating movie. Take big star, add big action, add a bit of seriousness, then a bit of spoof then to finish it off add a interesting plot. You have Last Action Hero.

I've always thought this movie was brillant. You have obvious gags - The glass eye seen at Slater's exwife's house. The cop rotates it completely blowing up the house. Then the next scene Slater and Danny at the police station smoking - literally. I Other scenes are subtle; Robert Patrick leaving the Police station as the T1000 or elsewhere the hubcaps on Slater's convertible change for no reason. Also, look for the E.T. and Lethal Weapon gags.  The gags really get going about 15 minutes in.

My favorite line these days when Slater punches the Leutenent Gov. in the face. ""Call me when the Governor gets here,"" hilarious stuff now that Schwarzenegger is the California Govenator.

I can see why this movie failed. The average action fan doesn't like it when a movie is spoofing what it bills itself as. Action fans take their genre seriously.  You have have a specific style of humor you enjoy to get this. At points the movie almost has a cartoon style feel. That things happen for no reason. Personally, I think that adds to the charm of the whole thing. There is a comic book quality here.

The biggest outrage about this movie is the current DVD release. Full screen pan & scan? C'mon, other regions of world (R2, R4) have beautiful widescreen releases with some features and AC/DC's video for Big Gun. Why do we not have this? Flabbergasts me. Sony/Columbia Tri-Star should be embarrased for this terrible North American release.

I hearby call on Sony/Columbia Tri-Star to give us this title as Europe and Australia have. Thank goodness I have a region free DVD player. I have the R2 version of the movie. Looks sharp.

As for the movie is it deep and causes you to think about your place in the world? No, not even close. Is it a fun popcorn chomper that will have you veering to serious to spoof in a matter of seconds? Yes, absolutely. Is it worth seeing Ahnold spoof himself? Yes. The scenes where Slater comes into the real NYC - fascinating, serious and fun.

Bottom line - this movie weaves serious, spoof, danger and brings it all home in the end. Its a cerebal movie you have to stay with from beginning to end to understand it. Catching it 25 minutes in on TV, more than likely you'd be lost.

Good stuff. Now, Sony/Columbia Tri-Star... get this awful pan & scan version off the market and give us the nice release Europe and Australia have!",4.0
"this movie was under appreciated

it's a hilarious motion picture

arnold schwarzenegger played the part perfectly

it's making fun of a typical action style movie and that's what makes it so hilarious

if you want to see a movie appropriate for all ages that will make you laugh over and over again get this movie!

it should be part of everyones collection",4.0
"I think I know why this film was so poorly received and tanked at the box office. It was TOO ""inside"". Much of this film is a series of jokes about the standard, conventional, formulaic, bombastic action film genre. But the humor was so tongue-in-cheek so often that it probably didn't bode well with the average action-junkie film fan. ""Last Action Hero"" made fun of itself as it unfolded, and one would need a certain sense of humor to fully appreciate it on its intended level. I dare say that most folks who went to this film just didn't ""get it"". Too bad for them.

 The major flaw of the DVD is that the film is presented in the god-awful Pan and Scan format. Pan and Scan presentations of frenetically-shot widescreen films should be outlawed, it's just that simple. You almost get a headache watching this P&S version. The digital pan is so obtrusive and distracting that it can drive one to anger! It pulls you out of the film, to say the least. I like (but don't really love) this film, and the low price of the DVD makes the purchase a no-brainer. But it is too optically uncomfortable to watch in P&S.

 Release it in widescreen and all will be okay.",4.0
"You've probably read this film's plot description already, but let me sumerize it briefly just to comment on it: Austin O'Brian is a huge Swartzenagger fan. Arnie's latest films (acording to this film,) are the Jack Slater movies, which (presumably) came out right after Terminator 2. Danny idolizes the character Jack Slater, a fictional L.A. cop, in the same way that so many of us idolized Han Solo. Then one day Danny's personal friend Mick, an elderly theater projectionist, gives him a magic ticket that was given to him by Houdini, just before Danny gets to watch the latest Slater film all by himself, before anyone eles does. (Jack Slater 4). Danny watches as the film introduces the two bad guys, who've kidnapped Slaters cousin Frank. The scene shifts to two nameless cops (who of course are sure-fire dead meat) who come to Frank's house after getting a false call about a drug deal. Slater arrives and wonders why they're here, he goes in and finds Frank tied to a chair, Frank gives Slater one last message before dying, Slater sees a note that turns out to be a count down and gets out just before the house blows up, the two red shirt cops...well, need I even say? A car full of dynomite-weilding bad guys drive up, Slater gets in his car and the chase is on! Then something strange happens. A stick of dynomite comes out of the screen and lands in the theater! It blows up, and Danny finds himself in Slater's car, now a character in the film!
I couldn't understand why so many critics and audiences hated this. Naturally I was upset when it bombed in the theatre. It was the most origonal film to come along in quite some time. I mean, really, who hasn't fantasized about being able to actually go into the world of their favorite movie or T.V. show and interact with the characters? Thankfully I see most people on Amazon have given this between four and five stars, so I'm not alone. I loved the action, the humor, (which is basically making fun of typical action films and just how absurd they are, even the ones that are meant to be taken seriously) and the one-liners.
O.K., here's one thing I _didn't_ like: the animated cat. I mean, what the @#&%?! The film works when it spoofs typical action films and ridiculous they are, but not when it goes all the way into the realm of farce and becomes something like Airplane! or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Everything eles was fine, but the cartoon cat...well, when's the last time you saw a conventional action film with living cartoon characters? Really, what were they thinking?
Also, there was the bit where (POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) we learn about half way through the film that Slater's son Andy was killed. This presumably happened at the end of Jack Slater 3. So Jack Slater 3, it would seem, ends with Slater shooting the Ripper (the bad guy from the last moive), and then the Ripper pulls Andy over with him. Would a typical Hollywood light-hearted action escapest film really have such a dark ending? Well, then again, I guess Lethal Weapon 2 had a simular ending.
Anyway, don't listen to anyone who's told you not to see this. This is not another dumb action movie, this is a film pokeing fun at dumb action films (including some of the ones Swartzenagger's made). Check it out for yourself.",4.0
"After his monumental success with Terminator 2, Arnold Schwarzenegger re-united with his Predator director John McTiernan for this action/fantasy farce.  The storyline concerns a young boy (Austin O'Brien) who comes across a magic movie ticket which allows Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger), a movie character who is played by Arnie, to leave his film world and come to the real world.  Get all that?  Good.  Schwarzenegger (who also served as executive producer) is great as he pokes fun at his action roles, his career, and himself.  The cast is sharp (including Charles Dance, Mercedes Ruehl, Tom Noonan, Bridgette Wilson, and Ian McKellan) with plenty of cameos (including Jean Claude Van Damme, Sharon Stone, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick, and Arnie's wife Maria Shriver) and the action is nicely directed, but Last Action Hero comes close to wearing out it's welcome thanks to it's overly long running time and anti-climatic ending.  Last Action Hero wasn't too well received by critics upon it's release, but it still stands as a fun Arnie romp.",4.0
"If there was ever any movie that celebrated Arnold Schwarzenegger movies it's ""Last Action Hero."" Actually, this film celebrates action movies in general. Directed by action legend John McTiernan (Hunt for Red October, Die Hard), this fantasy film about a kid named Danny who goes inside a Schwarzenegger film is loaded with nonstop action, some good laughs, and tons of cameo appearences, including: Ian McKellan, Robert Patrick, Tina Turner, Chevy Chase, Jim Belushi, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Little Richard, and Danny DeVito as an animated cat! This film brings in loads of fun, and the casting of Charles Dance as the villain is genius. Sure, this film isn't perfect, but if you're an Arnold fan it's plenty fun. Sometimes, the movie even works as a spoof of action, like in the car chase scene where literally every single car explodes. This film really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's actually one of my favorite Arnold films. I'd recommend this film to the child-at-heart; to the people who never really grew up. It's fun for the kid in all of us.",4.0
A good action packed film with Arnold Schwarzenegger! It's has good acting and the dvd was clear as a bell. It makes you think of what it would be like to have a fantasy hero come to life! If you like action movies this is a definite one to rent or buy!,4.0
"With its super-over-the-top take-offs of the most hackneyed action flick cliches ever seen on the silver screen, 'Last Action Hero' is one of the most enjoyable cheeseball classics I've ever experienced. Sure, it has the reputation of being a bad film, but it's bad in a so-bad-it's-good kinda way. Ah-nold's physical presence and delightfully deep-toned & accented banter really adds a great deal of... um... well, pretty much the same things to this flick as it has all the other actioners he's ever been in. And, like other flicks that feature a prepubescent kid, budding thespian Austin O'Brien gives this baby that tried-and-true aw-shucks-isn't-he-just-keeyoot factor that adds to both the hokey fun AND the nausea! The on-screen chemistry between him and Arnold is part 'Laurel & Hardy', and part Riggs-and-Murtaugh. Well, actually it's more part Abbott & Costello, and part 'Tango & Cash'... um, no that's not quite right, either. Well, let's just say it's a much better team-up than Sylvester Stallone & Estelle Getty ('Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot'). Come to think of it, what action-comedy team-up ISN'T better than that?
But I digress. If you're looking for a not-half-bad action/comedy flick that possesses plenty of super-hokey megacheese moments, and will leave you both entertained and mortified that you were entertained by it, 'Last Action Hero' just might be the movie you've been looking for!

"In the 1993 adventure film, LAST ACTION HERO, Arnold Schwarzeneggger reteams with director JOHN McTIERNAN (Predator) as Jack Slater, the action hero of the 90's.  Big time movie fan, young Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) receives a magic ticket from his old pal Nick- the projectionist of the films.  After getting a chance to see the new JACK SLATER movie before it opens, Danny is enjoying the action packed-soon to be-blockbuster when the ticket starts glowing.  A stick of dynamite blasts through the screen and BOOM!  Danny is in the movie as Jack's comedic sidekick.  Then, when Danny becomes Slater's new partner, he must track down Tony Vavawldi and his henchman Mr. Benedict.  The adventure is on!
MY REVIEW:
""This is obviously an underated SCHWARZENEGGER adventure flick!  It was sweet!  The action, the explosions, the humor, the one liners- all good.  Of course this isn't ARNOLD's best movie, but it does pretty well!  It may unbelievable, but what ARNOLD movie isn't?  Think- TERMINATOR 1 & 2, PREDATOR, THE RUNNING MAN, END OF DAYS, THE SIXTH DAY, JUNIOR, TOTAL RECALL, TWINS- all unbelievable ARNOLD films- but still entertaining!
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER and AUSTIN O'BRIEN make the best team!  LAST ACTION HERO rocks!  The opening scene says it all!  Have fun!  That's what fantasy movies are all about!  So enjoy this fun flick to catch with friends or just to watch with popcorn!""- MJV & the Movies.",4.0

"I can see why film critics panned this movie.  When has a critic ever given a straight up action movie a good review?  However, the fans all seemed to not like it either.  Why is that?  This is a very entertaining  movie!  The classic cheesy Arnold one-liners are there, but it's done on  purpose...it's part of the Jack Slater character.  The action is great and  the comedy is just right for an Arnold flick, although there's a bigger  focus on it than most of his other action flicks.  Not only that, but, to  go with the cheesy one-liners is a stereotypical, nearly one dimensional  villain.  This is not a negative...it fits right in with the feel of the  movie.
This is a definite must see for any Arnold fan out there.  I  thoroughly enjoyed it.",4.0
"this film is quite odd it's been brought up in a quite smart way, a young little boy goes to a cinema with a magic ticket given to him, the ticket makes the boy go to the movie with arnie, as the boy saw who murdered jack  slater cousin he becomes partners with arnold , together the two help one  another and together are going to get revenge, on the people who killed  arnie's cousin.
if you don't like the typical action well then forget  about this because this is arnies biggest action film when impossible  things happen like when arnies driveing with no hand and busy shooting the  bad guys.if your the erson who does love his typical action films then your  in he right place to buy it because your be watching it over and over until  you die.",4.0

"Released in 1998, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer chronicles events of the summer after the previous movie. Julie James best friend wins tickets to the Bahamas and so they go down there with their boyfriends (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer & Matthew Settle). Shortly after arrival they discover its off-season and storms ensue. Bodies increasingly pile up as Ray from the first film tries to get to the island (Freddie Prinze Jr.). Also on hand are John Black, Jennifer Esposito, Bill Cobbs and Muse Watson.

I didn't have fond memories of this film, but I surprisingly found myself liking it quite a bit on my second viewing. By switching the locations to the Bahamas it completely changes the dynamics even though theres a slicker-killer like the first movie. Suspense slowly builds as the cast is whittled down and the storm rages. It suddenly becomes clear that they're stuck on this vacant resort with a mad killer! Although the filmmakers couldve taken more advantage of the resort location they did a good enough job. Bottom line: This is a worthy sequel with its own appeal.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot at El Tecuan Marina Resort, Costa Careyes, Jalisco, Mexico (standing in for the Bahamas), and USC, Los Angeles, California.

GRADE: B- (a weak 4/5 Stars or strong 3/5 Stars)",4.0
An interesting sequel....good twist ending. Sad yet bittersweet when Ray had to pawn his ring for Julie to obtain a gun to go save her from potential death.,4.0

"This sequel was not disappointing at all! It has everything a sequel needs - more dead bodies and more gory deaths. What makes this movie unique, though, is the fact that it has a brand new plot!
Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is back with a whole new life, new friends, far away from South Port. When her best friend Karla (Brandy) wins a trip to Bahamas, she is ecstatic. Karla brings her new crush along with her and Julie (after Ray rejects) hooks up with her new friend Will Benson.
During their stay on the island of Tower Bay, they fool around at the Karaoke Bar and Julie sees a menacing message rolled on the screen ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"". She is badly shaken and wants to get off the island, but no one believes her. What is even worse, the storm is starting and therefore the telephones stop working. So, the four teenagers and five-member personnel are trapped on an island with a brutal murderer.
Soon, the bodies - killed in a very inhuman way - start to pile up and the history begins to replay itself.
I gave the movie 4 stars for the great music, acting, gore, scare factor and the unique plot twist. However, it was not better than I Know What You Did Last Summer and the ending was a little confusing, so that's why I didn't give it 5. You've got to see this horror movie, cause it is a one of a kind film.",4.0
"""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" (1998)
 ... This movie is cheesy, unrealistic and downright silly, but I loved the first movie, and Jennifer Love Hewitt is irresistible. I know I usually have a different word to everyone else on these types of movies, but if I enjoy myself, that is how I base my rating. This movie is my one of my best guilty pleasures, and I don't care what everyone else thinks, I enjoy watching it and that's me.
 Now ... why do I like this movie? There are many reasons. For starters, it's got everything a fun teen slasher requires. Lots of big breasts, reasonably good acting, truckloads of gore, unpredictable twists and turns, some big laughs, a scary killer and a brilliant setting. To add to that, the movie never stops with the scares, is never boring and had something that I really appreciated. In some teen slashers (Urban Legends: Final Cut especially) the main characters really don't really seem to care after their friends/people have been killed. In I Still Know What You Did Last Summer; Julie James is a very respectable character. She stills mourns for those she has lost and those she may lose. I was actually shocked with the amount of emotion the movie put on when showing Julie's new life and what she goes through.
The acting in the film is satisfactory for a horror film. Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as Julie James and once again she proves she's not just about looks, this girl can act. I want to see her give a performance that can give that idea more justice, not just horror movies please! Still she is good as Julie. Freddie Prinze, Jr. also returns and he has improved his acting skills. He puts on a solid performance. Brandy is very eager in the material and her performance worked for me. Mekhi Phifer had me rolling in the aisles with his fun performance as Brandy's horny boyfriend. I also enjoyed the underused Jennifer Esposito as the bartender on the island, and Jeffrey Combs' breakaway as the ruthless hotel owner. Muse Watson is scary and evil again, his facials are fantastic, but every time the guy talks I cringe. I just can't take his lines that seriously. Bill Cobbs is merely okay as the weird guy on the island who is suspected as the killer.
Danny Cannon's direction of the movie deserves recognition. The guy makes sure the movie looks great and brings tonnes of atmosphere to the movie. The killing scenes are done to perfection. I was glad he didn't just take the point-and-shoot routine that many horror movies use these days. Cannon put effort into his surroundings. Unfortunately the film editing is pretty atrocious. The characters' mouths move a lot when they're not saying anything, and injuries are cleared up very easily, like in one shot the person is hit hard with something, and then in the next shot they're running like hell and not even a bruise. Think about the editing techniques next time, Dan.
Trey Callaway's script is not perfect. While he does mix in freaky-as-hell horror with funny-as-hell comedy quite well with some great in-jokes and an excellent setting for a horror film, there is not much depth or range in the film. He does make sure all the possibilities are used for the killing scenes and horror action, but if Kevin Williamson had written this sequel, I feel it would've been a little more plausible. If you've seen the end of I Know What You Did Last Summer you'll know what I'm talking about, Ben Willis just couldn't of survived.
Bad editing, some silly dialogue, unanswered questions and cheesy lines do stop the movie from being great. There is also not enough depth to the film and damn, what was the final scene all about? But, excuse that and you've got what is my favourite guilty pleasure at the moment, and a fun slice of harmless horror.
MY GRADE: B",4.0
"While it's predecessor certainly didn't have a deep, complex storyline, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer boasts one of the shallowest plots in recent horror history.  However, since plot always takes a backseat to scares in horror films, I Still Know won't disappoint the avid horror fan.
The survivors of I Know What You Did Last Summer, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., and of course the fisherman, return along with a slew of new characters to be served up for slaughter.  Brandy stars as Julie's best friend who wins a trip to the Bahamas via a radio contest.  Mekhi Phifer and Matthew Settle are also along for the weekend in paradise.
Unfortunately, the fisherman also joins the party, and the hotel staff quickly begins to meet its demise at his hand (or hook).
The young cast does a decent job, especially the lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt, who wears a tank top that would be small on a five-year-old throughout the movie.
While it won't be known as a cinema classic, I Still Know will certainly satisfy fans of the horror genre.",4.0
"The sequel to ""I know what you did last summer"" is yours to own on DVD.  Featuring Brandy as Carla, Julie's new best friend played by Jennifer Love Hewitt.
After getting her life back on track Julie moves away to College and living with her best friend Carla, win 4 tickets to the Bahamas, after answering a radio competition.
Julie's boyfriend, Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) in the mean time is trying to warn Julie.
A couple of bodies may be found throughout the movie, screaming, running, and chasing, but in the end isn't that what it's all about?
3.5 stars, better than the first but still have the same ""teenage flick"" kind.  Personally better than Scream 1 and 2.",4.0
"I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

(USA/Germany - 1998)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: SDDS / Dolby Stereo SR

Given the enormous commercial success of sleeper hit I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997), a sequel was inevitable. Five more beautiful teenagers, including two survivors of the previous movie (Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr.) are hunted through a deserted, storm-lashed holiday island in the Bahamas by a hook-handed serial killer in Danny Cannon's lavishly mounted and hugely entertaining potboiler. It doesn't have the strong narrative drive of its predecessor and it tends to ramble aimlessly from set-piece to set-piece, while Trey Callaway's superficial script relies too heavily on implausible coincidences (like the tropical storm which gives the killer a helping hand by rolling into the island almost as soon as our heroes arrive, isolating them from the mainland!), but once the main scenario has been established and the killer has claimed his/her first victim, the thrills come thick and fast, with one genuinely scarifying climax after the other.

Gloriously staged and photographed (in widescreen Panavision, by Vernon Layton), the movie benefits from glorious location work - exteriors were filmed at the El Tecuan Marina Resort in Mexico - and the shameless deployment of a VERY LOUD soundtrack, while the actors do their best within the limits of their shallow characterizations. Look out for the superb Jeffrey Combs and Bill Cobbs in crucial supporting roles.

Director Cannon - who made a spectacular feature debut with the underrated British crime thriller THE YOUNG AMERICANS (1993) before crashing to an abrupt halt with the poorly-scripted JUDGE DREDD (1995) - begins to turn the screws very early in the film, adding a slightly unpleasant streak of cruelty to some of the murder scenes, and John Frizzell's shrieking music score sets the nerves jangling throughout. Some of the climactic revelations stretch credibility to the limit, but the film employs an eccentric, comic-strip logic which works on its own terms, and subsequent viewing reveals a multitude of clues surrounding certain characters and incidents which are cleverly designed to elude first-time audiences. So, if it's a genuine nerve-shredder you're after, this great big lunk of a movie is just the ticket.

By the way, there's absolutely no truth in the scurrilous rumor that the third film in this series will be entitled ""I've Got A Fair Idea What You Were Doing Last Tuesday And If You Don''t Stop It You'll Go Blind""...

NB. In fact, the third film was released direct to DVD under the title I'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (2006).",4.0

"I know I would get in the global critics good books if I said I Still Know What You Did Last Summer was a stupid piece of trite, but unfortunately I can't deny my own enjoyment of this film. I found it totally stupid but endlessly entertaining. If you go into I Still Know What You Did Last Summer expecting Scream; you'll come out vomiting. But if you watch it just looking for some silly slasher entertainment, you will no doubt enjoy it. The sets are beautiful, the camera tricks are worthy and the sound is extreme. I couldn't resist Jennifer Love's jublees and her acting is also good in this movie. A lot of the time the characters mouths move when they aren't even saying anything, which is a result of bad editing. The final reel is totally silly. But the clever death scenes and the characters actually caring about what happens to each other is a change from the usual horror films. It would have been better if Kevin Williamson had been involved, but I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is still watchable enough to pass an hour and a half. Two words sum up this movie: guilty pleasure.",4.0
"As a Movie Fan, I can Understand people Hating this movie, as a Male, I can't understand it. It is just Too Much Fun to Dislike, and we get Many a good Cleavage shot of The Lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt, plus a lot of Violent Deaths... Sweet.
But, as I consider myself a Real Movie Critic first and a Male second, I'll review it Like a real critic would... I Really, Really Love Jennifer Love.. Don't You.
But Seriously, It doesn't really have much going for it, Jennifer and Deaths aside. No one else in the cast make a Lasting Impression, except of course Horror Favourite Jeffrey Combs as the Hotel Manager. He is Always a Creepy Character, and he has a few Witty lines. Jack Black and Mecki Phiffer are Totally wasted on Characters who don't suit their Acting Abilities. Brandy really should stick to singing, as her acting skills are far from Polished.
Danny Cannon's Direction is Above Average, he never misses an opportunity to Zoom in on a Mutilated Corpse, (or, as I mentioned earlier, the lovely Jennifer) He is a Better Director than this Material allows him to be, but he does all he can do with it and that's all anyone can ask of him. He didn't write the Script.",4.0
"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer
Score: 67/100
As much as I really wanted to dislike I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, I, unfortunately, couldn't. This film has very bad reviews and didn't do excellently at the box office, but it isn't, surprisingly, as bad as it is supposed to be. It's not the teen-kill movie for everyone, but it held my interest, and is a pretty solid modern horror movie.
Two years after the horrible incident, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is back in college and is worse than ever having dreams about Ben Willis, the man who killed all her friends a couple of years ago. She gets comfort from a new friend named Will (Matthew Settle). Julie's other friend Karla (Brandy) tries to hook the two of them up and when she wins a trip to the Bahamas, she knows that it is perfect. But Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is still in the picture and Julie only goes as friends. Karla, her boyfriend Tyrell, Julie, and Will take flight right before Ray encounters the fisherman again. He tries to tell Julie not to leave but it is too late. Now in the Bahamas Julie is starting to lighten up and have fun. Then suddenly things start going terribly wrong when a storm hits the Island and people start to disappear. Ray takes a boat to the Island to warn Julie but will he make it on time to save Julie again from the fisherman?
It's all predictable and quite dumb, but if you don't look for a dazzlingly original story and a pitch-perfect script then I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is great fun. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a nice heroine, she is continuously good to look at, and the set decoration is nice, although I found it odd that it was set on a Bahamian island and was shot in Mexico. Still, there is heaps of eye candy in many scenes and there are no breaks from the gore, which is great for teenagers, although the film was a tad too graphic for my liking. The only absolutely major quibble was the editing. Half the time it looked like the actors mimed the words and then put them onto a speaker phone after the shooting, and it looked terribly messy and was a largely irritating flaw. But, don't worry about that too much, just sit back and let this film do what it was made to do - entertain.
I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is far, far away from perfect, but both as a silly slasher flick and a stupidly entertaining brew, it works quite admirably.",4.0

"The Seventh Sign is a unique horror.  For some reason I've never heard about it until now, and what's especially surprising (to me at least) is that Demi Moore would star in such a movie.

I had to do some research in order to write this review because otherwise my review would have been too vague and probably inaccurate if I hadn't (not that it's anything to write home about either- admittedly my mind shuts down when religion becomes the subject because that opens the door to an overwhelming amount of information).  It's about the character of Jurgen Prochnow portraying Jesus.  He comes back to Earth.  At first it seems his mission is to cause Demi's character harm and in particular harm the baby inside Demi's belly which is why Demi constantly visits the hospital for checkups and worries something might happen to either her or her baby.  Complications arise frequently- some of them real others in Demi's mind.

However without spoiling too much, Jurgen's character arrives to intervene.  He finds himself battling a mysterious ageless priest (Peter Friedman) who wishes to cause harm to Demi's baby.  Throughout the movie we see Demi constantly sneaking into Jurgen's room because he's renting a room on Demi's property and she suspects something is suspicious with his attitude.  She becomes nervous upon finding out all the paperwork he has up there related to the Apocalypse.

Demi's husband (Michael Biehn) often thinks Demi's crazy whenever she tries to explain Jurgen is trying to destroy her baby and/or the world.  She discovers many notes that lead her to think bad events are coming for everyone because sudden earthquakes and damaging hail storms start occurring out of nowhere.

When Demi searches for answers by knocking on the door of a family who she believes can offer help, she unintentionally has a conversation with Manny Jacob's character who walks by and overhears the chaos Demi accidentally causes with the upset family.  He explains that she's disrespecting the family by doing certain mannerisms that are against their religion, and due to a twist of good luck, Manny happens to understand and interpret the language she's looking for answers from.

What makes the Seventh Sign so good is the atmosphere and writing.  There's never a dry moment in this movie, right down to Demi thinking she sees Jurgen everywhere around town, to the amazing conclusion that you'll probably see coming but won't mind because it makes sense in the context of the story.  There's another element to the story that involves a young man who murdered his family and is set for execution, but to be honest it's really confusing trying to understand how this all ties into Jurgen and Peter's characters.

Simple put, while I'm skipping over tons of information here, Demi has to sacrifice someone for her baby to live.  It's really sophisticated and though the story was confusing to follow at times, I never seemed to get *too* lost.  The atmosphere, characters and writing continued to impress me the entire time, and with heavy emphasis on Exorcist-style religious scriptures in the writing which is an easy comparison to make, I'd say the Seventh Sign is a fantastic movie but on a slightly lesser scale than the Exorcist in creepiness, atmosphere and writing, but then again the Exorcist is a horror classic so it would be really hard to out-do that movie.  It comes close though.  Great movie.

There's many layers of storytelling to a film like this, and whether all the religious information is real or fiction I wouldn't be able to tell you.  Either way I highly recommend this movie.  Even if you know next to nothing about the religious stuff explained here, this shouldn't present a problem in understanding what's going on.  Demi playing lead role in a movie like this is just amazing to me!",4.0

"I like this movie.  I'd say it falls in the religious or metaphysical realm, and it's a story that's been told many times in multiple formats.  Demi Moore is believeable, and Jurgen Prochnow is fantastic, as always.  It really doesn't give the details that most of the other stories do...almost as if discussing a religious story might be so offensive to the movie watchers, that they prefer to avoid almost all of the actual biblical lore.  It's a nice movie for a quiet evening, but it's really not that deep.",4.0

"This is a decent apocalyptic themed movie.

I have been a fan of the genre, ever since I saw ""The Omen"" back in 1976.  If you like these types of movies, you should also check out ""Revelations"".  This movie, ""The Seventh Sign"" is not as good, in my opinion as The Omen, Omen II, Omen III:Final Conflict, and Revelations.  However, it is well-made and the acting performances were very good.  Perhaps one of the most solid performances from Demi Moore in her career.  Michael Biehn and Jurgen Prochnow also lend their talents here.

The end of the world is coming, according to the signs.  River water turning to blood, ice in the desert, and the moon changing colors are all signs that the end is near for mankind.  The premise here is that the supply of souls in heaven has run out, and when the first soul-less baby is born, the destruction of mankind will be irreversibly set in motion.

The story takes place in Venice, CA.  Of all places for mankind to prevent the apocalypse it had to be here, right?  Well, you have to be willing to buy into it, naturally.  An exotic setting, perhaps somewhere in old world Europe or the Middle East would have been my preference, but California is what we have.  Abby and Russell Quinn play a young couple who is trying to have a child.  Their first attempt ended in stillbirth.  One day, a stranger claiming to be a linguist arrives in town and asks to rent the couple's garage loft.  Not long after, a mysterious priest starts meddling in the couple's affairs, doing everything in his power to ensure that Russell's client (he is a lawyer) faces execution for his crimes.

This is a pretty good movie.  If you have seen those other movies above, and you liked them, you will most likely like this one.",4.0

"The Seventh Sign is a pure religion sub-genre addition. Some may instead view as more of a drama but the horror elements are there and it was classed in our genre.

 Indeed it does not have a high body count, much gore, or attempt to really frighten - but it does deal with a terrifying premise: the apocalypse. It also has some disturbing images woven throughout and is darkly themed. It is more of a horror meant to disturb and deeply interest than lightly entertain or terrify.

 Demi Moore is surprisingly exceptional in the role of a woman who wants a baby more than anything in the wolrd. Michael Beign is her husband, a man attempting to save someone off of death row. We love when either of these are on screen and they both shine. Michael Beign is the gorgeous type of guy already familiar with horror - from The Terminator and Aliens to other sci/fi, disturbing roles. As far as I know this is a first for Moore but she conveys fear well and causes sympathy. What also helps is that her character is actually interesting. We see her side of things and get into her mind a bit, making the movie play out even better.

 The plot itself is that the apocalypse has come around and it all evolves around the upcoming death of an unmentioned person/situation who we later see in the movie. The movie involves an old poem/source called ""The Gulf"" which is also known as the hall of souls. A mysterious stranger comes to town and rents out the room subletted by Demi Moore's character Abby. It is shown by the very start that he is the ressurected Jesus, who has come to start the signs and cause destruction. After each seal is broken another nightmare ensues.  An a subplot there is a situation involving Abbys unborn child - apparently before this pregnancy she had not been able to carry her last infant to full term. Her mental stability is based on the survival of her pregnancy and the stress of the events coming forth are not helping. We get to see her flashbacks, dreams, fears, excitement for children, worries for herself, ect., while she is trying to figure who this stranger is and if he's in any way part of everything that's going on. Other mysteries insue and we as the audience are drawn in and held tight. The husband Michael is out of the picture a lot of the time working at his job but he is apparently worried about the health of Abbie. When he's there he adds, when he's not the plot continues without fail.

 So overall, if Abby can figure out this mystery, she will be the woman that gives the world a second chance and stops the end of all mankind.

 Unfortunitely she doesnt know what the hell is going on and we follow her through different confusing paths. She thinks ""Jesus"" is actually some madman into some sort of strange rituals at first and then keeps evolving her opinion. Her emotional problems don't help her at all but are a great addition to the film.

 Along with unusual dreams and freaky flashes, beautiful music and story emotion on all levels, the Seventh Sign is a classic religious film often overlooked.

 People not of the Christian faith may have a little more trouble losing theirselves in the plot but if so I pity them. To me watching a movie effectively comes with the ability to open your mind to the beliefs and settings of the characters, no matter how foreign or alien the situation appears to you. I can watch The Craft or another film based on pagan religion, satanism, and what not - there is no reason an athiest cannot enjoy a film speaking of Christianity in high terms. Just my opinion though. Turned off by a film by the content alone seems sad, like you lack the ability to truly ""Just watch a movie"". If you don't enjoy religious sub-genres at all then of course avoid. But if you enjoy some give this one a chance.

 If I can accept strange outer space films, giant lizards, made up lands, creatures that don't exist..then I can watch anything and believe in it for those two hours.

 In the end The Seventh Sign is summarized as a powerful story that is emotionally wrenching throughout, and a jarring ending you will not forget.",4.0

"The magnificent Demi Moore (PARASITE, HALF LIGHT, MR. BROOKS) plays Abby, a pregnant woman who just might hold the key to the apocalypse.

Yes, it's a Demi Moore 80's classic and yes the eyewear in this film reminds me of whay I always wore contacts then, but it is actually pretty good.  I hadn't seen it in so long. I didn't remember very much of it.  It's a pretty fun, tense, fast-paced religious apocolyptic thriller.  You could find many worse ways to spend and hour and a half.",4.0
"This Apocalyptic thriller is pure entertainment. It centers around the seven signs that signal that the end of the world is nigh. When those signs start appearing around the world, the only question is whether the world can be saved. It seems that the answer to that question lies in the grasp of one person. Who is that one person to be?

A very young Demi Moore stars as Abby Quinn, a pregnant woman with a history of miscarriages. She and her husband are eagerly and hopefully awaiting their baby. He is a lawyer who is passionate about his clients. One, in particular, the Word of God Killer, has some significance in how events unfold in the film. The Quinns live in a lovely home with an apartment over their garage that they rent to a mysterious stranger (Jurgen Prochnow) who purports to be a teacher of ancient languages.

Unfortunately, Abby has some issues, as well as a penchant for having a recurring dream that figures prominently in things to come. As the events unfold in the film, one has to suspend belief, as Abby does things that no one having a high risk pregnancy would do, and the plot spirals into being almost ridiculous at times. Still, notwithstanding its deficiencies, the film manages to entertain the viewer and keep one's interest.

The film has some excellent performances, including that of Peter Friedman as a man of the cloth with a long past. It is Jurgen Prochnow, however, who steals the entire show as David Bannon, the mysterious teacher of ancient languages who seems to carry the weight of the world upon his shoulders. Who he ultimately turns out to be is entirely believable. His performance is so compelling that those sharing a scene with him fade into the background. While exuding sensitivity and caring, he also manages to be one of the sexiest men on the silver screen. His performance is what makes this film worth watching.",4.0

"Very atmospheric and well acted depiction of the sordid world of New York's Time Square forty years ago.  Beautifully photographed.

A little slow getting started, and a couple of the sub-plots are unnecessary and therefore do not move the story forward.

The relatively happy ending for the central character is not believable, and contrasts with the noir tone of the rest of the film.

About twenty minutes should have been cut from the final version.",4.0

"It's just a movie and it's not meant to (nor does it claim to) be based on the actual book of Revelation, which in and of itself may very well be ""fantasy."" Don't take yourself too dang serious.
This film has dream-like imagery and an understandable plot if you keep it simple and don't try to base it on (or compare to) your religion.

I don't agree with the negative reviews, but I certainly understand.

"The Seventh Sign, a surprisingly effective piece of Apocalyptic guf from the days when Demi Morre's breasts were still real and she could still play likeable characters. It's quite shameless in the way it invents additional verses to the Bible to support its hotchpotch of apocalyptic predictions and throws in elements from everything from The Wandering Jew to Rosemary's Baby, yet it all works surprisingly well, mostly because the cast and director Carl Schultz take it completely seriously, even pulling off a surprisingly touching ending. Clearly the Fundamentalists were too busy threatening to firebomb the theatres playing The Last Temptation that season to note the film's own unique interpretation of a p***ed-off Christ who has lost all patience with humanity: ""I came as the lamb but I return as the lion.""

No extras, but a fairly good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",4.0

"Forty years ago audiences were stunned by the movie TAXI DRIVER. Not only did it depict New York City as a world filled with seedy characters it was the first major role for Robert DeNiro who had grabbed the screen by the throat three years earlier in MEAN STREETS. It was also introduced writer Paul Schrader to most of the world, his only previous onscreen offering having been THE YAKUZA two years prior and was a follow up for director Martin Scorsese who had directed ALICE DOESNT LIVE HERE ANYMORE 2 years earlier as well. This combination of talent created a movie still talked about to this day.

DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a slightly unhinged Vietnam War vet dealing with bouts of insomnia. To make money while dealing with this he takes on the job of a night time taxi driver in New York. Rather than the up and coming Wall Street crowds this lends itself to his dealing with customers of an unsavory nature. Pimps and hustlers, prostitutes and riders with no issue having sex in the back seat while he drives. Its a slimy world that we view through his eyes.

While he may seem undisturbed by all of this there is a strange sense of decency lying underneath this crust on display. Bickle has his own sense of what is right and wrong but even that is askew from what most of us would agree with. He looks down on the denizens of the night but doesnt even realize how bad things are until we see later.

He befriends a young girl on the street, a near pre-teen prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster). For him its a question of friendship and trying to help her. For her hes just another john, but someone nice rather than the usual clients she has.

One afternoon he notices a young woman working in the campaign office of Senator Charles Palantine. Obsessed with her he watches her whenever he can. One day he walks in and applies to work for the campaign, finding out her name is Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). He asks her out on a date and she agrees. But here is the glimpse of his not knowing right from wrong as he takes her to a XXX movie on the date. She walks out disturbed as he tries to find out what he did wrong, having no clue.

While still pursuing her he is pushed aside, denied the chance he longed for. This leads him to feel the need to do something to atone for the mistake he made, a way of cleansing the city streets he rides of the filth he sees there nightly. His mind is twisted and his first thought involved assassinating Palantine. But before the films end his search for redemption will lead him elsewhere.

The combined efforts of those mentioned earlier make this film work on all levels. Scorsese, a native of New York City, brings forth images of a location he knows well, the streets and neighborhoods he walked when he was young. Its gritty, dirty and down to earth, no picture postcard land of hope. Schraders script builds on the location. The film could not have taken place in Boise. It allows us a glimpse at what lives in the darkened alleyways, the hopeless masses that find themselves working at the lowest of possible jobs just to survive where the law of the jungle rules.

DeNiro made a name for himself with his performance here. Its not just the words that Bickle speaks, most of which are in his narration of events. Its not the way that he looks at the world or watches what is going on around him. Its not the odd way of thinking in a nave way that makes him who he is. It is the combination of all of these things and more that make him shine in this role.

Everyone remembers the most quoted line from this film, Are you talkin to me? It is one moment in the film but a powerful one in the most subtle way. It shows the character of Bickle slowly losing touch with reality. There is no telling where he will go from here.

The movie remains a work of art as well as an entertaining film. Of course not entertaining for everyone, especially the easily offended. But to watch it now, 40 years later, and still feel its impact says a lot. Extras include three different commentary tracks, a Tribeca Film Festival Q&A for the 40th Anniversary, featurettes including Martin Scorsese on Taxi Driver, Producing Taxi Driver, Gods Lonely Man, Influence and Appreciation: A Martin Scorsese Tribute, Taxi Driver Stories, Travis New York and Travis New York Locations, the theatrical trailer, the documentary Making Taxi Driver, the featurette Intro to Storyboards by Martin Scorsese, a storyboard to film comparison and galleries.

If youve never seen the film this is the way to do it. Not only because of the ton of extras included but because its the cleanest presentation of the film to date. Once seen it is not easily forgotten. It really is as good as they say.",4.0

"Iron Eagle is a 1980s fighter pilot film with an enjoyable fiction narrative. The movie focuses on a teenager, Doug Masters, gaining flight experience from a veteran F-16 Pilot. The film is geared to provide an entertaining action story, and Doug's accelerated desire to fly in combat is to rescue his dad who has been shot down in the Middle East. The soundtrack and hairstyles in this movie will take you deep into the 1980s! This is a combat motion picture that is palatable to a wider audience as it doesn't contain excessive violence.

"Doug Masters (Jason Gedrick) is a high-school senior and an Air Force brat, the son of fighter pilot Col. Ted Masters (Tim Thomerson), a daring Cessna pilot and a hopeful AF pilot himself.  While awaiting his graduation on a base somewhere in the Southwest, he gets the word that his father has been forced to eject over a hostile Middle Eastern country (probably Libya), captured, tried, and condemned to death.  The Federal government doesn't seem to want to do anything to get him out, but Doug isn't giving up.  With the help of a band of dedicated friends, other AF kids who call themselves ""the Eagles,"" he obtains intelligence, fuel, computer time, maps, ammo, even a fraudulent flight plan (it helps that one of his best pals, Milo Bazen (Robbie Rist), is the son of the top Intel officer on base), then ropes Reserve Col. Charles ""Chappie"" Sinclair (Lou Gossett) into serving as his wingman in a desperate transatlantic flight to rescue the Colonel.

The story may be a bit improbable, and the '80's opinions may not be PC, but you forget that once Doug gets into the air, whether in his Cessna or piloting a ""borrowed"" F-16 and hammering the living daylights out of enemy installations.  Indeed, in a world where American tolerance for military risk seems to diminish with every year that goes by, the movie is the kind that may just reignite your patriotism.  The aerial sequences are fantastic and worth the price in themselves, and whatever you say against Doug's methods, two things you have to grant him: he's brave as a lion, and he's not giving up till he saves his father.  This is a story about courage, family connectedness, friendship, and being willing to risk your future and your life for what you think is right.",4.0
"Jason Gedrick, Louis Gossett Jr., and Tim Thomerson star in this high-flying 80s action film about a pilot who is shot down and the lengths his son will go to save him.

Thomerson stars as Col. Ted Masters.  He and his wingman are on a routine mission over the Mediterranean Sea when they are jumped by MIGs from a middle-eastern country.  The name of the country is never given, but, due to the time when the movie was made, it can be assumed to be Libya.  Masters and his wingman manage to shoot down three MIGs, but Masters himself is eventually shot down and captured.

Meanwhile, Ted's son Doug (Gedrick) has become a fairly good pilot himself.  He and his friends have their own flying club, and they enjoy flying their Cessnas on the weekends.  Doug has an enemy in school who challenges him to fly ""the snake"", a dangerous canyon near the air force base.  Doug accepts and, even though someone messed with his plane, Doug still manages to win.  However, his victory is short-lived, for he soon finds out about his father's capture and impending trial.

The U.S. Government is powerless to assist Doug's father, and Doug soon learns that his father has been found guilty of spying and is going to be hanged in three days.  With no other options available to him, Doug concocts his own plan to fly in and free his father himself.  He enlists the help of Col. ""Chappy"" Sinclair (Gossett).  Chappy is a retired pilot who lives on the base.  He's extremely reluctant to help Doug with his far-fetched plan but, after thinking it over, he decides to go along with it.

Now its up to Doug's friends to somehow come up with two fully-loaded F-16s with a full combat load, refueling schedules, approved flight plans, and other necessary logistics to pull the plan off.  Sure enough, Doug's friends somehow manage to make all the necessary arrangements and Doug and Chappy are soon winging their way across the Med.  Will they succeed in rescuing Doug's father, or will they be too late?

I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  Granted, the story is extremely far-fetched, but the action sequences are very good.  Gossett does a good job as Chappy, and Gedrick gives a good performance as Doug.  Fans of great action-adventure movies won't want to miss Iron Eagle.",4.0
"Little Doug Masters (Jason Gedrick) has an Air Force pilot for a father, an incredibly irresponsible father who has been allowing him to fly training missions since, evidently, Doug hit puberty.  The kid has more simulator time than anyone on base (wherever that may be).  He's so into flying that he has a club of fellow high school aviators - officers' kids - who take their personal planes out on the weekends for fun...and to race paint-huffing morons on dirt-bikes through treacherous mountains.  He's a whiz at flying (but not acting).  Doug's happy little world halts when he finds out that not only did his application to the Air Force Academy get denied, but his father was also shot down, captured, and scheduled for a hanging in an undisclosed Middle Eastern country.

Doug enlists the help of his flying buddies (two of which are Styles from Teen Wolf and the gay dude from Revenge of the Nerds) to hatch a rescue plan.  Along the way he manages to get the help of a retired Air Force Colonel named Chappy Sinclair (Louis Gossett Jr.) who just happens to have flown with Doug's father.  After the two find out that the U.S. government has their hands tied in red tape, Col. Chappy decides to put a plan into action.  He'll require the considerable talents, connections, and tricks of each member of the flight club.  They'll have to steal maps, get top secret armament information of the enemies, hack into government computers to get F16s with enough ammo (and flight plans) to take on an entire Arab country, and exploit every moron the Air Force could possible assemble on one facility in order to save Doug's father.

After all the training, the shenanigans, and the ubiquitous 80s montage in which Louis Gossett Jr. shakes it to an old jukebox, the training mission gets the go ahead, and it's up to Doug and Chappy to rescue Doug's father from the evil, Arab terrorists (and not face long-term prison when and if they get back).

This movie is one of the most enjoyably improbable movies of all time.

"I remember first watching Iron Eagle when it came out on video. As a twelve year old I thought it was an awesome movie. As I grew older I realized that the effects in it were low budget, the plot was a little on the far fetched side (a group of high school kids getting into maximum security areas? Gotta love the 80s!), and the battle scenes were unlikely.(how many times did Doug's F-16 fire that same missile?) However this is just a fun movie to watch! The movie shines for one of the best characters ever; Col. Chappy Sinclair made so memorable by the great Louis Gossett Jr. I was very dissapointed in the DVD not being available in widescreen but then again I never have seen it in widescreen so I don't know what I missing. It does have a few special features but none worth watching again. If no one out there has ever watched this series, watch the first one and leave it at that, just like the filmmakers should have done! I mean was Iron Eagle 2 such a box office smash that it needed to have two more sequels made?? Anyway if you are a child of the 80's like me then you have to have this movie sitting right beside Wargames on the shelf.",4.0
"Iron Eagle is about a group of teenagers who need to save one of their fathers from the clutches of an evil unnamed country.  Of course the US government is too weak to act, so they enlist the aid of Chappy, steal a few fighter planes, and take care of business.

The opening scene with the ""snake run"" is soooo 80s!  A race to prove manhood between a motorcycle and an airplane.  Through canyons!  And the last guy who did it DIED!

The flying scenes are pretty well done and are at least as thrilling as those in Top Gun or other movies of the period.  There are plenty of satisfying explosions, even from things that seem like they ought not explode.

"Four Iron Eagle movies were made. This is by far the best. Often true of any series of movies, the first is so good it inspires sequels. I saw this movie during its first release. It was great then and it is still fun today. Surprisingly the aircraft are still used today and so it seems timely even now when you consider what is happening in Iraq. Filmed during Ronald Reagan's administration it is interesting how this could apply even today. All in all a stand out movie that is still fun to watch today. This is one most the family will enjoy.

A high school graduate finds that his father has been shot down over a Middle Eastern country and is being held hostage. He has three days to rescue him before he will be hanged. He enlists the aid of his fellow flying club friends and a retired Air Force Colonel to concoct a plan to fly over and rescue his father. Good acting, great flying sequences, and excellent music soundtrack make this worth catching. I love the soundtrack, especially his flying song by Queen. Good quality DVD with little in the way of extras. Still worth adding to your collection of family action movies.",4.0
"The first time I saw this I must have been about 12 or 13 and I thought it was BETTER than Top Gun in some aspects.  The plot was extremely far fetched an 18 year old rescues his father from some un-named ""Middle Eastern"" country with the help of a retired Air Force Col. and his friends Btw how the hell can one kid have the whole base wired for his own personel needs? The acting wasn't that bad Lou Gossett, Jr was ace as retired AF Col. Charles ""Chappy"" Sinclair  Jason Gedrick was very good as Doug ""I got the whole god dam base wired"" Masters (Too bad Doug got blown out of the sky in IE II) and the Minister of Defense played by David Suchet aka Poirot was great as the ""bad guy"" of the un-named Middle Eastern country.  I liked this the most out of ALL the movies that were made.  I got it dirt cheap so I am going to complain about the lack of any extras it was a good movie in its time and I enjoyed it for what it was even if it was fantasy. Just stay FAR AWAY as possible from the sequels esp II & IV III I don't remember too much about as I haven""t seen it in YEARS.

"Long of the short of this movie is that the star's father is shot down by some badguys over a unnamed country in the Mid-East.

After getting help from Louis Gosset Jr. The star steals a pair of F-16's with help from his High School buddies and goes over there to rescue his father after the US government decides to sit on it hands.
This is typical 80's action flick that came out the same time as ""Top Gun"", they were about 6 months apart. It is a decent way to waste a lazy weekend afternoon when there is nothing else on TV or for a road trip. Although it can get to be a bit hollywood patrotic at times, it is still good fun to watch.

"Viewer's experience should lead to catharsis and growth. 4 stars for room for improvement.  5 stars for profundity and superiority to most films.

The film makers need to focus more intentionally on the Viewer's Experience:  In the commentary they miss the point and the potential of the movie.  (This is often the case with these commentaries.)  They seem to polish their egos a little too much rather than keep the focus on the viewer's experience.  The viewer is not just a viewer, a camera technique, an angle.  The viewer is experiencing something that is leading to growth or insight or release, or the film or art has failed.

To be fair, I did not, could not, listen to all the commentary about the film but was surprised that what I experienced in the film was not at all what they were talking about.

There's a great deal of extra material on the two disks...if you like that kind thing:  going around and about the film from every possible angle -- but often avoiding going deeper into the film, distracting from the take away, homogenizing our experience into movie-making and acting and other trivia, exactly the thing we should seek to forget in order to internalize and participate in the creative experience.

1. The film even as it stands -- without improvement -- is not primarily about loneliness, unless loneliness simply is a word for all that ails human beings.  I can't make a final judgment about the professor's thoughts about loneliness as this movie's theme unless I read his book about loneliness in film, but...not quite true for Travis.

Travis is not primarily seeking companionship or he would act differently.  Human contact is not his primary value. He looks desperately lonely to many viewers no doubt, and we tend to think what happened would not have happened if he were attached somehow to someone -- anyone...not seeing how desperate a belief that is.

To me it's highly significant that Travis writes.  He is writing about his experience: he is wanting to understand life, his life, to grow. And he does not want to take the easy out. In fact, his bringing Betsy to a porn movie is only stupid if his primary need were to escape loneliness. Travis's behavior here only makes sense as an attempt to bring his vision of a pure and angelic other into the world he is seeing and trying to make sense of.  He needs another view but he needs someone who can go into his world enough to understand.

2.  Neither is the film about a Vietnam vet who is or becomes psychotic and shoots 'em up, not primarily.  If that were true than this film would not even deserve 1 star.

Somehow the film has to be about you and me, and it has to open a door into our shared human condition.  As soon as we show our fear by describing and talking about lonely vet Travis, a ""psychotic"" or crazy, out there somewhere, we are distancing ourselves and the film becomes a failed attempt at entertainment or merely a way to affirm our own safety and sanity. We merely toughen ourselves, not soften ourselves to the true power of this film.

So I was disappointed to hear the writer and professor talking that way in the features. They didn't seem to ""get"" the powerful potential of their own work.  Or at least it eluded them when they spoke, or perhaps it eluded them after the success of the film or the book and their claim of ownership to something permanent.  Instead they should seek to open up a discussion to viewers about how the film could communicate it's potential meaning more effectively to more people.

The trouble with an anti-hero is that we are tempted not to identify with him.  It is too painful.  The Greeks knew they could only create catharsis through identifying with a larger than life figure.  The film plays with that awareness that we have to raise the protagonist to heroic proportions somehow in order to find our way.

I liked all the acting very much.  Every character was fantastic, real and powerful.  The ending, however struck a note of unreality.  None the less, this felt perfectly right, because the film is expressive of psychological viewpoint: the eyes being a central symbol.

Travis's eyes (as is true of us all) see selectively. The film is playing with the idea that humans have limited views and distortions: for example, the angelic American goddess  in the back of the cab, who suddenly is adoring Travis as heroic, is conceivable:  People do follow the interpretation of events they read in newspapers, the interpretations they want to hold.

But I was left feeling unsure whether Travis had actually gone ballistic or just imagined it. So for the ending I think Travis should have looked a little different from the beginning.  His looks showed that they filmed the ending before the tomahawk haircut, it showed the seams of the work, let's say.

Yes, circling back to the beginning is effective in this case -- but not exactly the beginning -- never exactly the beginning. There has to be a change however subtle, or the circling is meaningless and it is not a real circling.  His hair could have been cut a little different, shorter, something.

The ending left me seeing him as both crazy and sane.  He was sane, he went crazy and he came back to sanity, or not, never completely.  And so we all are (he is a cab-driver again, just one of the millions of people in New York).  We never know what could break us. Ironically if we look with full sanely at the dark side we are most in danger.

And there will be a next time was the message, someone will go off the deep end, but not necessarily Travis. He is not the problem. That's how I experienced the ending....Travis shocked by his own eyes in the cab mirror...those eyes could belong to anyone riding the cab.  After all the Travis character did not have threatening eyes.  De Nero's eyes in fact sometimes burst out with happy sparkles.  Rather his eyes are universal, the potential harm or good lurking there determined by how we see things and whether we feel we can act to improve things.

Travis was the most sane in a way.  He was seeing how bad things really were and was not in denial.  The other taxi drivers and other characters had defense mechanisms of one kind or another. Perhaps all that keeps us sane are our favorite defense mechanisms. This is both good and bad.  Because if denial is too complete then the only prophets we can have are crazy.",4.0

"I'm old enough to remember when Taxi Driver came out - but I never watched it. I don't know why. I finally decided it was time - it has been such an iconic movie - and I never quite know what the references to the movie are about. It was surprisingly still relevant. I was also expecting to be disappointed by the cinemagraphics and it was perfect - and by that I mean - I wasn't distracted by cheesy props or obvious old technology. For as raw and simple as this movie is - it is not simple at all. Robert De Niro - looks so achingly young and plays the ""hero"" - a burned out vet driving a taxi. I couldn't understand why he royally screwed up his date with the woman of his dreams - but it helped to make it clear just how screwed up in the head his character was. Jodi Foster was heartbreakingly young and I kept thinking about my daughters or myself at that age - and how horrible it was that she was so street savvy and so young. But both of their performances were just stellar - absolutely sucked you in and made you believe in them. If I had watched this then - the message may not have been as clear to me - as it is now. One take away for me - is that this is not such an unlikely scenario for our psychologically wounded vets. We have so many out there - at this point in time - ""they"" are saying the average number of veteran suicide a day is 22. 22!!! Watching De Niro's performance was like looking inside the head of one these soldiers - you got that he just didn't care about anything any longer - and it was obvious that no one cared about him. I am a veteran myself - and have some of my own fears. I am completely against wars - because they are nothing more than a racket - making money money for civilians and killing young idealistic people - all for the sake of power. This movie solidified those thoughts for me. Overall I enjoyed it - but it was definitely dark and dreary and should only be watched when your own internal system is well enough to handle this kind of misery.",4.0

"I had never seen this film and was interested in it from its historical perspective regarding John Hinkley's obsession with it and his assassination attempt on President Reagan. I had heard different opinions on whether Robert  DeNiro's main character in the movie was psychotic or not. Interestingly, there is no convincing evidence that the character was psychotic even though he decided to look psychotic at the time of the actual shootings. Without giving away the ending, it appears that the main character did have a bit of a conscience even though he was seriously disturbed.",4.0
"DeNiro, Shepard, Foster, and Keitel in a gritty story of lonliness and redemption. Martin Scorcese(also acts a small role),
in one of his earliest works as a director, captures perfectly the lonliness and despair of street life in NYC. Jodie Foster,
as a teen prostitute, is worthy of our sympathy. Harvey Keitel, as her pimp, is well cast for this role. Travis Bickell,
played by DeNiro is authentic as the spurned admirer of Cybil Shepard . Travis becomes the hero in the violent
conclusion of this story. A classic, timeless film....",4.0

Then he also comes in contact with a young girl who makes her living working the streets. His frustration deepens and he begins to work out and collect weapons. It becomes obvious he is about to explode and after an initial failed attempt he does  just that. However, ironically the aftermath leaves him as a hero. Travis is an interesting character because you feel sorry for him and yet he does things that are truly wrong. I found Bernard Hermann's score, the voice-over narration, and the cryptic ending all to be interesting parts of this film.",4.0

"There are already hundreds of opinions and interpretations of the film, its acting, directing and influences via film noir, so I will dispense with those and focus solely upon the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray

Once you get past the first few scenes displayed as gritty and grainy as the characters of the film, you are presented with a stunning transfer of the video to BluRay and your home screen.  The film must have been remastered as my Standard Def version doesn't look nearly as good.  The colors of the city, the skin tones and contrast are all beautifully rendered for your home theater.  The whites appear as if they were 95 IRE and really brings home the excellent contrast on this blu ray version.  Once past those opening scenes where the grain and grit is clearly deliberate,  there are no artifacts or ghosting of any kind and no noticeable or distracting grain that wasn't meant to be there.  5 Stars for the movie and 5 stars for the video transfer to Blu Ray.

The Audio is DTS HD MA 5.1 and the lossless audio clearly makes a heck of a difference.  All audio levels are nicely balanced and the dialogue doesn't fight with the musical score which is mostly a soft jazz.  The score is very nicely spread across the front stage and the separation of instruments is in a very comfortable stereo spread.  The audio of the film is the only reason why I dropped this film down a star to 4.  There is no use of your rear channels or even the front left and right channels, nor your sub LFE channel at all.  Even during the shooting scene at the movie's end, where a gun shot should have been placed via a discreet channel, all the action, all the dialogue and all, except for the jazz score, is coming down your center channel.  Not clear on why they did not use any directionality for the many foley effects but that is the only negative.

There are more extras with this Blu Ray than you can sit through at one time tho I did sit through many.  The BR also contains all the extras that were on the original release plus lots more including several still shots on a nice quality paper with the DVD's case.

While I might not watch this film again for another year, I am very glad to have the upgrade to Blu Ray as it is heads and tails superior to the Standard Def version I bought a few years ago, plus, you can't beat the inexpensive price.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

"This is a compact collection and doesn't take up much space on your shelf. Each of the 8 movie discs is in its own slim-line case. I've decided to keep just three of the movies and give the rest away.

Only 2 of the movie discs have substantial Bonus Features, a couple of which I recommend. The audio interview on the ""Blazing Saddles"" disc is very interesting. Find out what John Wayne said after reading the script.  Hear how Gene Wilder ""saved my life."" It's worth it just for the story of Madelaine Kahn's audition.

I also recommend the Mel Brooks commentary on ""Young Frankenstein"". It's not the best commentary ever, but it was fun for the extra stories.

Notably, this collection does not include Brook's directorial debut, ""The Producers"", for which he also won an Academy Award for the screeplay. It also doesn't have ""Spaceballs"" (1987) and ""Life Sucks"" (1993), which are no big loss to me. Finally, the last film Brooks directed, ""Dracula: Dead and Loving it"" (1995), is not included. It is a family favorite and we have it on separate DVD.

This is a review of the DVD set. The movies in this collection have differing spoken and subtitle language options, and I've given those.

1.  ""The Twelve Chairs"" (1970) There are some good sight gags, but they almost come off as comedy sketches, rather than a cohesive movie. 3 stars for me.

Spoken language options: English Spanish.  Subtitle options: English, Spanish
Bonus Feature:  ""Mel Brooks Theater"" Trailers for six Mel Brooks films.

2.  ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974) The three years before ""Blazing Saddles"" came out were lean years for Mel Brooks. He needed a hit to stay in Hollywood, and he got it with this send-up of the Western genre, not to mention its poke in the eye to racism. Madeline Kahn got -an Oscar nomination for her impression of Marlene Dietrich. Still, I barely found it funny. 3.6 stars rounded up to 4.

Spoken language options: English, French, Spanish.  Subtitle options: English, French, Spanish
Bonus Features:
....A.  Cast. A list to read of the cast members and their bios.
....B.  Production Notes. Four pages of notes to read on the screen. In 1984, Mel Brooks won the WGA (Writers Guild of America) Award for Best-Written Original Screenplay for ""Blazing Saddles"".
....C.  Interview with Mel Brooks (62 minutes) The interview is audio only, so they've run it while playing the movie in the background. There are no subtitles for the interview itself. I think the interview dates from around 1998.
Mel's idea was to do a black comedy, ""literally, black comedy."" He was a fan of Richard Pryor, who hadn't hit stardom yet. ""So I called Richie..."" and they wrote the first draft with a bunch of other writers: working title ""Black Bart."" As Mel continues, ""We didn't know the words 'politically incorrect'."" They were actually more worried bout getting the f*a*r*t*ing scene past the studio.
....D.  Theatrical Trailers
....E.  Film Flash

3.  ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) This is a 5-star family comedy, brilliant with slapstick and subtleties. Well, OK, usually not so subtle. In the Mel Brooks interview which is a bonus feature on the ""Blazing Saddles"" disc, Brooks calls this movie ""a gift"". Obviously a lot of hard work and talent were needed too, but it is a film where everything comes together wonderfully. Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks were nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.

Spoken language options: English, French, Spanish. Subtitle option: English
Bonus Features:
....A.  Director's Commentary. (no subtitle for commentary) Re-watch the movie with Mel Brooks telling stories and explaining filming decisions. I enjoy film commentaries and this one did not disappoint. Brooks brings up casting and B&W lighting, music and pauses and inflection for effect. Above all, the sets and lighting: ""The camera-work had to marry the material.""
....B.  ""Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein"" (36 minutes, subtitles available) This enjoyable featurette was filmed in 1996. It features Gene Wilder (plays Frankenstein), Michael Gruskoff (producer), Stan Allen (assistant editor), Gerald Hirschfeld (cinematographer) and Bill Gordean (assistant editor). They talk about the genesis of the story and how everybody worked together.
When ""Young Frankenstein"" was being filmed, no Hollywood studio had issued a movie in B&W for 7 years. The studio said it had to be filmed in color. Per Hirschfeld, ""Mel was very adamant about the fact that if they were going to do it in color, he wasn't going to direct it.... Mel said, ..."" we really want it to be more than the original.""
....C.  Trailers. Five slightly different trailers for this movie. ""It's coming, from the deep dark recesses of the mind of Mel Brooks.""
....D.  TV Spots. Four minutes of different-length TV commercials.
....E.  Deleted Scenes (17 minutes total) There's 7 deleted scenes in all. The 1st is the longest, and was originally going to be the beginning of the movie
....F.  Mexican Interviews (7 minutes) Marty Feldman, Gene Wilder and Cloris Leachman are in costume in these short interviews filmed with a Mexican host. Feldman explains that his ""hump"" is a ""pregnant pad"" someone found in the stock department.
....G.  Outtakes (5 minutes) There was a lot of laughter on this set.
....H.  Production Photographs

4.  ""Silent Movie"" (1976) This was an OK movie for me = 3 stars. Living up to its name, there really are no voices in this movie, only sound effects with captions for dialogue. It feels like a TV show, rather than a movie. But I did like Marcel Marceau's cameo.

5.  ""High Anxiety"" (1977) This is Brook's homage to the films of Alfred Hitchcock. It's fun to see if you can pick out the specific scenes which are a take on a Hitchcock scene. As I love Hitchcock, this raised ""High Anxiety"" to 4 stars for me.

6.  ""History of the World Pt 1"" (1981) Here and there, some good schtick. The humor is very broad, certainly politically incorrect for our times. Another okay = 3 stars for me.

7.  ""To Be or Not to Be"" (1983) I thought this was 4 stars, a movie reminiscent of the screwball comedies of the 40's (except it's in color). Anne Bancroft stars and she is lovely and lively. She and Mel were very happily married until the day she died.

"You get 9 films on 9 discs in this collection: Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, History of the World Part 1, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Silent Movie, To Be or Not To Be, and The Twelve Chairs. Six films are brand new to Blu-ray in this set. Overall, the picture quality is very good but the audio quality is fairly average (High Anxiety and The Twelve Chairs don't sound great but otherwise the sound quality is good). All the significant special features from the DVD versions have been ported over and there is plenty of exclusive content for fans. There is over 7.5 hours of total bonus content plus 4 audio commentaries (Twelve Chairs has only a trailer). You also get an exclusive 120-page book in this release. My only real complaint is that the packaging is somewhat flimsy.

"The purpose of this review is simply to clarify that the original 2009 release of this collection on Blu-Ray came in a large box and included a lavish hardcover book. Thus the reviews complaining that the oversize package is hard to store.

The set has recently been re-released at a substantially lower price, packaged in a 9-disk blue plastic case of standard height and width, sans the book. Instead there is a simple 16-page pamphlet tucked into the front cover.

The discs and extras are the same as the first release. ""The Producers"" is still not included because it's still not distributed by Fox, as are the 9 included titles.",4.0
"This is a must-see for any serious movie fan.  Robert De Niro is spectacular as troubled loner Travis Bickle.  We watch his sense of alienation grow as he descends into a kind of heroic madness.  He's that rare evil character that you actually find yourself rooting for, never mind that he's turned into a deranged sociopath.

Why not 5 stars?  There's some ridiculous editing in this film.  A lot of it is in the climactic shoot out.  Matthew, the scumbag pimp, takes a a bullet in the gut and returns several minutes later as fresh as a daisy wielding a .44 magnum and firing at De Niro.  There are some strange continuity issues as De Niro climbs the stairs surrounded by his rivals.  You kind of have to see it to understand.

Also, there's the famous final scene when Travis emerges as a hero.  It's likely that the dying Bickle fantasizes this whole scene, but that's never made clear to the audience.  That confusion at the end is enough to eradicate a star in an otherwise brilliant movie.",4.0
"Wes Anderson is an acquired taste.  His aesthetic is very uniquely tuned into who he is as an artist that if you aren't dialed into his brand of humor his films will be lost on you entirely.  I have to admit, I am not a fan of all of his work, but when he hits a home run it is a real, tried and true masterpiece, and I must say that I have found his latest two offerings to be undeniable cinematic treasures.

In my attempt to fully familiarize myself with this man's work, I dug back a few years to see where it all started.  In 1996 he teamed up with Owen Wilson to flesh out a short film they had released two years prior.  Thus, the careers of both these men were born.  Wilson went on to gigantic fame, thanks to his chemistry with the camera and his knack for playing the lovable loser, but his collaborations with Anderson show a depth to his talent that other directors have yet to tap into.  `Bottle Rocket' is a blast of a film that shows all of Anderson's promise and potential, and while it is certainly rough around the edges and lacks the glossy veneer and visual grandeur that he brought to his later films, the gritty indie quality adds a layer of likability to the film.

It's oddly relatable.

The writing is really key here.  Without the surprising character development, this would have been an average film at best, but there is so much between the lines here, in the things that are not said, and the comedic development is even richer than expected.  It's easy to see why Owen is the Wilson with the career, for Luke is rather lackluster but then again, his character is the least interesting.  He's even upstaged by his love interest, and she barely speaks a word of English.

Look for scene stealing supporting performances from Lumi Cavozos and James Caan in this heist film about bumbling idiots that is sure to make you smile.",4.0

"""Bottle Rocket (1996), the first feature by Wes Anderson has become a cult favorite, and made the names of Anderson and Wilson's (three brothers, Owen, Luke, and Andrew acted in the picture, and Owen, the self-proclaimed troublemaker co-wrote the script with Anderson) popular, and their fans waiting for more. BR is an offbeat crime/comedy about three friends, Dignan (Owen), Anthony (Luke), and Bob (Robert Musgrave) who tried to pursue the career of the professional criminals. If ever three screw-up characters were less suited for becoming tough guys, thieves or bank robbers, I am yet to see them on the screen. Of all three, Dignan takes the cake - his brazenness, ineptitude, clumsiness and lack of any sense of reality in the combination with the true belief that he was born to become a ""made man"" (or something like that) and that the local ""godfather"" Mr. Henry (James Caan in a very funny cameo) would take him and his friends seriously are absolutely adorable. Andrew Wilson, the oldest of three brothers has a small role as Bob's obnoxious older brother. I personally don't think that ""Bottle Rocket"" is a masterpiece and the best movie of that year but it certainly has got some very funny moments, especially in the beginning (Dignan helps Anthony to run from a mental hospital and soon they pull a job of robbing the local book store; Dignan interviews Bob for a position of a runaway driver) and in the end when three friends are sent by Mr. Henry to the biggest (and the most hilarious) heist that would be the apotheosis of their careers. Owen Wilson's Dignan is a reason enough to see the movie - so hilariously deadly serious about his absurd plans, schemes, and ideas he is.",4.0
"Wes Anderson is probably one of my favorite quirky directors. With films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-Aquatic-with-Steve-Zissou/dp/B00005JNLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Royal-Tenenbaums/dp/B0000640VJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Royal Tenenbaums</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rushmore/dp/6305428239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rushmore</a>&nbsp;in his repertoire, I feel the ""quirky"" title to be appropriate. Best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rushmore/dp/6305428239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rushmore</a>&nbsp;(1998), Anderson's films have a unique edge to them. Definitely not in-your-face comedy, their impact is much dryer and subtler (I remember the nude gal in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-Aquatic-with-Steve-Zissou/dp/B00005JNLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a>&nbsp;just being there because some nudity was needed. And I remember Bill Murray driving back and forth over his enemy's bicycle in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rushmore/dp/6305428239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rushmore</a>&nbsp;then placing it back in its bike rack and how I knew this would influence the battle yet-to-come).

I'd never heard of BOTTLE ROCKET until somebody pointed it out to me. Having enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rushmore/dp/6305428239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rushmore</a>&nbsp;tremendously, it came highly recommended. And after watching it, I can see why.

This is early Anderson, and a film that helped launch his inimitable movie style. Released in 1996 and starring the newly found Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen), it goes to show that Anderson knew how to pick a good script and good actors to round out a chuckle-fest.

Luke Wilson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Super-Ex-Girlfriend/dp/B000J4QW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Super Ex-Girlfriend</a>) is no stranger to Anderson films now, having been given the lead role here and later strong supporting roles in The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, Luke can celebrate his strong Anderson film trifecta and proudly point back to his roots in this film. Brother Owen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cars/dp/B00005JNS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cars</a>) is one up on Luke in that he has performed in all of those, plus The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.

Mental health issues abound for Anthony (Luke Wilson) and his buddy Dignan (Owen). In fact, Anthony has just been released from a voluntary psychiatric facility where he was resting after a nervous breakdown. Waiting for him in the bushes (literally) is Dignan, who believes Anthony is escaping from the psych ward instead via his own free will.

The two quickly go back to their old ways. They decide to return to a life of petty thieving and even do dry-runs by ""robbing"" Anthony's family's home in order to see if they still have their robbing edge. They also decide to take on the strangest heists (from meat packing plants to bookstores). Since neither of them own a car, though, they have to get a driver and they pick Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) simply because ...well ...he has a car. Their first felony occurs at the aforementioned bookstore and they make quick their getaway, leaving town and scurrying across the state. They end up at a motel in the middle of nowheresville and decide to hold up. But the trio quickly turns sour when a pretty young hotel maid name Inez (Lumi Cavazos) catches Anthony's eye. Speaking no English, the Central American goddess fails to realize how messed up yet in love Anthony is with her (partly due to the language barrier and partly do to Anthony's fumbling ways).

Word eventually comes to Bob (the driver) that a family member is in trouble and he has to return to town. Since he has the only car, Anthony and (more importantly) Dignan, flip out, telling him he can't leave. But he does and leaves Anthony and Dignan stranded at the hotel (which is fine with the love-struck Anthony). But Dignan wants to get out of there, so he devises a plan to steal a car and return to their lives of thievery. Not wanting to leave without his newfound love interest, Anthony tries to convince Inez to come with them. A misunderstanding ensues and he and Dignan are back on their debauched road. Eventually they take on a robbery at a meat packing plant and it goes horribly. Risking everything, eventually a choice has to be made about who stays behind -- and takes the risk of capture -- and who goes free.

It is the strange and quirky (there's that word again) that drives this film. Owen Wilson's character (Dignan) is obviously an extreme case of an excessive-compulsive. He plans out items to the nth degree, ensuring that everything is okay decades later. Anthony (Luke) struggles to regain some sense of normalcy in his life but keeps getting dragged back down by his bond with Dignan while being tugged the other direction by Inez.

In the end, all turns out bizarrely well. Dignan ends up where he belongs, Owen gets what he needs, and even Inez finds what she's looking for.

Certainly one of the less known Anderson films, this one still comes highly recommended, just not as highly as his more recent works.",4.0
"Definit own if you have any luke or owen wilson films.  Two middle class guys with a crazy outlook on life - that need something to do.  luke commits himself to a mental hospital - at like 20 because he needs a break from life . . . then him and his friends rob a book store because they didn't want to live a normal life and wanted to gain street credit with this stunt - to get in this gang later - and make crime money.  it all gets screwed up - check out punk drunk love ..

"Big fan of Mel Brooks.  This is my first Blu-Ray disk purchase, in fact.  I was very disappointed that The Producers was skipped (especially since it was the first film he directed) which is why it got 4 stars.  Not quite so much that Dead and Loving It and Life Stinks were excluded.  Many BR-disks/DVD's support mouse use when playing through a PC, but these disks do not.  Not a huge issue, but a quibble nonetheless.",4.0
"As others have stated, if you enjoy Mel Brooks, you will definitely enjoy this. The video transfer is excellent; I was surprised by how clean and crisp movies like Blazing Saddles looked (barring a couple of moments). It was also a great opportunity to watch some of Mel's earlier work that I had never seen before. It is good to see that they hold up well without being looked through the lens of nostalgia.

If you are purchasing this collection to watch outside of the US, please be aware that it is region free, with the exception of Young Frankenstein, which strangely is region A (US) only. But as this collection has not been reprinted locally (that I am aware of), it is not much trouble to simply purchase a local Blu-ray copy of Young Frankenstein to replace it.

It is unfortunate that The Producers (and Life Stinks, and Dead and Loving It) are not included in this collection, but I assume that they were unable to obtain the rights to include them. The packaging is also rather bulky and non-standard, but it does include a great companion book telling the stories behind the movies.",4.0

"I bought this Mel Brooks Blue-ray collection for my husband as a gift.  We have enjoyed watching three of the movies so far.  Recently, we watched Spaceballs and as other reviewers have noted, the brand new DVD stopped mid movie.  We took the DVD out and wiped it down, saw no signs of scratches.  Placed it back in and had the same problem.  We couldn't play approximately 2-3 chapters of the movie.  We skipped ahead and the rest played fine.  We have yet to watch 3 more of the movies and hope this will not be a problem.  We enjoy all the extra documentaries and interesting facts about the movies.  Mel Brooks is true comic genius and this is a great collection of his work!",4.0
I initially had stated problems with some of the discs...Would not all play in my Samsung DVD player but a firmware update seems for the most part to have corrected things....the material is off the hook...Young Frankenstein in Blu-Ray just unbelievable!

"Even though he's only made four movies, Wes Anderson is one of the most talented, interesting, and quirky directors in the business.  He's still young, but with only four films under his belt he's already become a synonym for a very distinct type of filmmaking, e.g. ""That movie was kind of Wes Andersonish.""  Having seen the final three films of the Anderson canon (RUSHMORE, THE ROYAL TENEBAUMS, and THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU), I finally had the opportunity to see Anderson's debut feature, BOTTLE ROCKET.  The movie begins rather slowly, but by the end I was laughing my head off and decided BOTTLE ROCKET was my second favorite film next to THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU.

The movie was released early in 1996 and though not as technically strong as Anderson's later pictures, it illustrates the genius of filmmaking that he is.  In addition to being Anderson's major directorial debut, the movie is also known as the film that catapulted the Wilson brothers, Owen and Luke, into superstardom.  Luke Wilson portrays Anthony Adams, a young man who is struggling with his identity and purpose in life.  After taking time to recuperate at a voluntary mental hospital, Anthony returns home and meets up with his childhood friend, Dignan (Owen Wilson).  Anthony is looking forward to settling down and getting on with life while Dignan has bigger plans for both of them.  Dignan wants Anthony to enjoy life, too, but through a totally different means than he imagines:  a life of pleasure gained from committing crime.  At first, Anthony isn't willing to join Dignan's wild scheme, but Dignan is persistent and breaks through Anthony's reluctance and gets him to join him on a crime spree to impress Dignan's former boss, Mr. Henry, a supposed local crime lord.  Dignan also gets another friend, Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) to join the scheme.  While Dignan goes about planning the caper, Bob tries to fend off his bully brother John, aka ""Future Man"" (Andrew Wilson--the overlooked Wilson brother) and Anthony falls in love with a Latino motel housekeeper named Inez (Lumi Cavazos).

The film leads up to the caper itself, an event that is both hilarious and heartbreaking.

All of the actors do a great job.  I particularly liked Andrew Wilson (whose real childhood nickname was Future Man because he was seen as being so serious and looking to the future) and Kumar Pallana who portrays Kumar, a supposed expert safe-cracker that Dignan adds to his crime team.

Not everyone is going to enjoy watching BOTTLE ROCKET.  The movie has a very odd pacing, even for a Wes Anderson film.  It's evident that both the director and cast were adjusting to making a major picture.  Also, since this is a Wes Anderson picture, not everyone is going to like, enjoy, or even understand the humor.  There are no cheap gags or easy jokes.  Instead, the comedy can best be described as intellectual-situational.  In short, it's kind-of Wes Andersonish.  A must-see for fans of Wes Anderson or any of the Wilson brothers as well as anyone who likes quirky dramatic-comedies.",4.0
I liked this movie.  I wished there was audio commentary.  If there is a Criterion Collection available I'd get it.  But I have to settle for this one...,4.0
"If we could decide wich movie deserves a special edition, there will be trouble. For example, i think ""alien vs predator"" sucks bigtime, but deserves it`s special editions cause of both series fans and the tons of extra materials that they can provide, comming often from special effects. Other cult classics have no special effects, but can provide interviews and other info , very useful or appreciated for the fans.

This is the case, cause Wes Anderson`s directional debut is a highly important independent movie, for its style, that gived a whole new perspective of filmaking in low budget for the 90`s, i think the film deserves better.

This movie deserves a far better edition that this one, that offers nothing besides typical audio and subtitles options. What a shame! Besides that, the picture and sound quality are very decent in this edition, wich makes this dvd very recomended, but only on the movie`s own achievement. You won`t find here anything but a great,  important film.",4.0
"This is the movie that started what we know as the Wilson Brothers Mafia takeover of comedic films. Me, You and Dupree, My Super EX-Girlfriend, Weddingcrashers and Old School wouldn't have had the Wilson brothers, had they never collaborated with co-writer Wes Anderson.

Everyone knows the Wilson brothers from Royal Tennenbaums, but that's not the kind of movie that you can watch over and over again with the jokes getting better. Bottle Rocket was just the beginning of the 25 year plan.",4.0
"Taxi Driver is not an easy film to watch, it's both gritty and confronting at times, and the depiction of New York as an ""open sewer"" is pretty depressing. That said it is an important film in the history of cinema, not the least because it serves as an interesting glimpse of society in the time in which in was made. De Niro's performance is a standout, but all the actors play their parts extremely well. It's hard to come away unaffected by Taxi Driver, and to me that's the mark of a great film. The Blu-ray edition looks great considering the age of this film, though it's obviously not as sharp as recent releases. This Blu-ray worked fine in my region B player.",4.0
"Robert De Niro and more star in Martin Scorsese's 1976 drama.
A Vietman Vet takes a job as a New York cabbie and turns
homicidal. This is a terrific film that's definitely one of De
Niro and Scorsese's best. This 2-disc set has good picture
and sound plus neat extras. Get this.",4.0
"'Taxi Driver' is a dark film looking at one mans alienation from society and life around him. It looks at how he gradually descends into his own form of madness and you really get a sense for how he feels through De Niros chilling portrayal. The lack of sleep and night shifts Travis (the main protagonist) works only serve to isolate him further from reality and life. When he meets a young political campaigner and a prostitute, both of these relationships spur him into dark action against the scum of new york. I have to say the direction and acting was excellent, you really get a feel for the malevolence Travis feels around him and his sense of disjointed exhaustion. The soundtrack is very dated now and the same jazzy refrain used throughout the film started to get on my nerves. It is a good film and definitely one to watch, but I have to say I was expecting so much more after all the hype on these pages and from things i've heard before that I was left a touch disappointed. The ending is powerful and then kind of fizzles out afterwards, you'll know what I mean when you watch it. Overall a good film and worth a viewing.

"The movie is great, but I already knew that before I bought it.  My particular copy sometimes blips for a second or two at a couple spots during the movie.  I suppose you can't complain too much when the cost is low, but it doesn't warrant an outstanding rating.",4.0
"Low-key, deadpan humor is the name of the game in this quirky comedy that is chock full of Wilson brothers.  Owen wrote and starred in the film alongside brother Luke, and yet another Wilson brother plays a small role as their buddy's brother.  Bottle Rocket is definitely a quirky little film, and its humor won't appeal to everyone.  Inevitably, you'll either enjoy it or wonder why such a nothing story was ever made into a film.  By this point, I have to come to terms with the fact that I am actually an Owen Wilson fan; I can't help it - the man's just extremely funny.

The story centers around Anthony (Luke Wilson), who just got out of a voluntary mental hospital, and his one-of-a-kind buddy Dignan (Owen Wilson).  Dignan has big plans; in fact, he has the next fifty years charted out.  This master plan of his calls for Dignan and Anthony to pull a few burglary jobs and thus impress the local landscaper (I mean, criminal mastermind) Mr. Henry (James Caan) so much that he makes them part of his crew.  Dignan obsessively maps out each facet of his plans, treating them as daring capers of great importance, but Anthony and his friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) tend to get distracted rather easily.  The first job, a little after-hours bookstore robbery, sort of succeeds despite itself, and the trio goes on the lamb until the supposed heat is off, holing up in a cheap motel out in the middle of nowhere.  Here's where things start falling apart, at least insofar as Dignan is concerned.  Bob's all worried about his brother having been arrested for the pot that Bob was growing in his own backyard, while Anthony falls in a rather pathetic - but awfully sweet -  kind of love with Inez the housekeeper (Lumi Cavazos) - despite her limited knowledge of English.  Everyone goes his separate way, basically, but the gang comes back together in order to pull their most ambitious (and, of course, wildly unsuccessful) heist yet.  There's not a great deal of story resolution at the end, but that's okay; the film's ambiguity is actually one of its strengths.

Bottle Rocket is a decidedly quirky film, but the characters of Dignan and Anthony really grow on you.  Poor Dignan, despite all of his big plans and enthusiasm, is really just a loser going nowhere, while Anthony basically just wants the world to slow down to his low-key pace and to be reunited with Inez.  The whole film thrives on a fairly intellectual brand of comedy - no toilet humor, outrageous pratfalls, or low-brow, course jokes to generate cheap laughs.  Sure, the movie is sort of stupid, but the comedy certainly isn't.  Basically, you either get Bottle Rocket or you don't.  That's probably one of the reasons that the film has never managed to generate a giant blip on the radar screens of movie viewers - and that's too bad because Bottle Rocket really is a funny little oddball of a film.",4.0
"Compared to Wes Anderson's other films (The Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore, & The Life Aquatic), Bottle Rocket pretty much got the silent treatment by the public, not to mention the group that put this DVD together (it's bare-bones in the special features department). If you haven't seen it, it's your loss...Anderson's debut is arguably as funny as anything on his resume.

Owen Wilson also makes his debut playing the standout Dignan, a ""mastermind in his own mind"" amongst a trio of wannabe criminals. Words don't do his role justice...Dignan's simple presence practically provokes laughter.

Someone unfamiliar with Wes Anderson's works might want to start with Bottle Rocket first, since it's probably the lightest & most ""accessible"" of his films...be that as it may, the ride is no less rewarding. 4.5 stars.",4.0
"Bottle Rocket is ostensibly about a pair of recently graduated high-schoolers who, through boredom or ill-ambition or the mercy of friendship, choose to initiate their early adulthood with a heist.

The film begins as Anthony, played by Luke Wilson, is checking himself out of a club-med style mental institution where he has spent time for exhaustion--though this despite the fact that he has never actually worked a day in his life. He has, however, to leave the institution through a window so that his best friend Dignan, played by real-life brother Owen Wilson, may think that he has helped him to escape--though this despite the fact that Dignan hasn't actually done anything more than signal his presence with a mirror and wave to the psychiatrist whom he has mistaken for a complicitous janitor. On the bus-ride back home, Dignan shows Anthony his spiral notebook in which he has outlined their life course for the next 75 years. And they are, it seems, already behind schedule. So, to get underway and to provide themselves with a capital base, they plot the robbery of a bookstore. They also enlist the aid of another friend, Bob, played by Robert Musgrave, who will drive the car. The robbery is a success of sorts though their disguises are no disguises and their progress is impeded by the absence of bags that will hold something bigger than a paperback. Dignan is ecstatic over their success and in a fit of good fellowship proposes that Bob be given the ""Spirit Award"" for his part in the crime. They then go on the lam for a while, hiding out in a large motel on an otherwise uninhabited stretch of Texas highway. There, Anthony spies and falls in love with a member of the motel housekeeping staff, Inez, played by Lumi Cavazos. There are a variety of complications that then conspire to divide the crew, after which Anthony and Bob undertake a series of non-criminal activities such as a paper route and coaching a pee-wee soccer team, and Dignan returns to his old job at the Lawn Wranglers, which serves as a front for the larcenous activities of Mr. Henry, played by James Cahn. Anthony and Dignan eventually reconnect and, for the purposes of bolstering Dignan's self-image, Anthony joins Dignan in one last large-scale heist, meant to impress Mr. Henry. The film ends with that heist and the capture of one of its perpetrators in an act of humanity.

The beauty of the film lies not in the complications or originality of the plot--but in the course of the character development. The boys are not really criminals but people pretending to enjoy what they believe are the non-material rewards of crime--a kind of life-informing cool. Which is to say, I suppose, that they are mere teenagers looking for the kind of social selves and knowing attitudes that can only really come from having lived a little longer than 18 or 19 years and at some other business than being a teenager. What's more, they have chosen a career requiring a soulessness and absence of empathy that belies their own thoroughly good-natured polity.

They can't quite get the criminal patter down and have eventually to revert to ""Sir"" and ""please"" and ""I'm sorry"" before they can complete their first robbery. When one of them is later used and betrayed, he doesn't want anyone to think that there are ""any hard feelings."" And when Anthony gives away the last of the money that they have stolen, Dignan can only scream ""That's inappropriate!""--a sentiment and phrasing that are as harsh as it gets while delivered with the most profound sincerity.

If you have the time and the inclination, I recommend that you go to your local video store and rent this sweet tale of a collection of courteous naives whose criminality can't quite free itself from the rules and conventions that govern good humor and civility.",4.0
"The debut film of director Wes Anderson bears the signature quirkiness of his subsequent efforts and that's not a bad thing at all.  Though not as fully realized as ""Rushmore"" this film has alot to recommend it.  Owen Wilson displays his comic dynamism as Dignan, the off-center young suburbanite with delusions of being a bandit.  Luke Wilson has some touching moments as Anthony, Dignan's begrudgingly loyal pal who reluctantly goes along with Dignan's far-out schemes.  Luke Wilson's best moments come in a romantic subplot involving a Paraguayan motel housecleaner.  Central to the plot is a warehouse heist that is hilarious and it's subsequent ramifications I will not spoil for you here.  You have to see it to believe it.  Though not classic stuff, a very interesting and funny film.",4.0
"The movie ""Bottle Rocket"" was widely ignored in 1996, but after a few years, the film has gradually gain respect and fans. ""Bottle Rocket"" was directed by the great indie director Wes Anderson, who wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Owen Wilson, who plays one of the main characters of the movie, Dignan.

 ""Bottle Rocket"" tells the story of a small time thieves trio: Dignan (Owen Wilson), Anthony (Luke Wilson) & Bob (Robert Musgrave). One of the strongest points of the film is that the characters are so well developed that it's easy to feel identified with them. Plus, the story is a breath of fresh air, something that is difficult to see frequently in these days.

 Definitely this is a sweet little movie. Recommendable for indie films lovers.",4.0
"Released in 1996, this is Wes Anderson's first feature movie and the beginning of a great career that has also included the fantastic quirky comedy-dramas ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" ""Bottle Rocket"" isn't the equal of those films, but it is a great start to Anderson's career, and a fine little comedy. It also marked the beginning of the stardom of Owen Wilson, who co-wrote the script with Anderson and plays the most noticeable and memorable part. The film was shot in Texas, Anderson and Wilson's home state, based on a short film they had made two years earlier.
The movie has the type of laid-back and character-driven humor that won't appeal to everyone. This is comedy that doesn't target laughs or build up elaborate set-ups as most comedies do. Instead, the humor is continuously slow-pitched to you in the form of weird but likeable characters, off-center attitudes, and situations that seem familiar to us but are played in unreal ways and thus become extremely funny. All together, it's an extraordinarily enjoyable and pleasant movie that strolls through its story with no particular rush.
Owen's brother Luke Wilson, who had so far appeared in every Wes Anderson film, plays Anthony Adams, who gets out of a voluntary mental hospital after recuperating from a breakdown. His friend Dignan (Owen Wilson) has big plans for both of them -- a life of easy and enjoyable crime! Dignan doesn't have any good ideas, but tries to make up for it with endless enthusiasm and an outrageously optimistic view of life. Unfortunately, when things inevitably don't go well for him and his friends start criticizing him, he can fall into pretty bitter depressions. Owen Wilson has the character nailed down, and Dignan sets the tone for most of Wilson's other characters: the enthusiastic but misguided nut. Dignan gets his friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) in on his plan to pull a 'job' (and all of Dignan's 'jobs' are minor-league suburban affairs) that will attract the attention of the local crime boss/landscaper, Mr. Henry (James Caan in a brief but darned funny performance). Dignan get obsessed with his planning and attempts at damage control, while Anthony and Bob are more busy with the really important things in their lives: Anthony falls for a housekeeper at a motel (Lumi Cavazos, from ""Like Water for Chocolate""), and Bob tries to deal with his bully of a brother, Future Man (Andrew Wilson -- yep, another Wilson).
The film has some sad and serious moments -- after all, these are characters who are really going NOWHERE in a very boring suburban landscape -- but with Dignan around it never stays down for long. There are plenty of chuckles and some real moments of howling laughter, especially during the climatic 'take down' (and I'm really using that term pretty loosely). Another Wes Anderson favorite actor, Kumar Pallana, who appeared as Pagoda in ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" is on-hand to add comedy as a safe-cracker (and again, I'm really using that term loosely).
If you like quirky, odd, but realistic comedy, and if you've enjoyed Owen Wilson in many of his later performances, ""Bottle Rocket"" is really worth a look.

"The combination of Wes Andersen and Owen Wilson has proved to be a formula for success.  Artistic success of a unique sort, these two have provided us with a taste of what modern filmmaking can do.  Colorful, imaginative, and funny, Bottle Rocket is the first in a series that brought us the splendid Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums.
The movie plays a bit like an inside joke, though it is a joke that welcomes you in.  If you let yourself into the circle you'll find yourself rewarded with a terrific viewing experience.
The plot itself is described as ""resovoir geeks"" which is accurate.  It borrows nothing from Resovoir Dogs, however, but the premise of being a heist movie.  Though to call this a heist movie in the traditional sense, would be silly.  Our characters here have no idea how to pull a REAL crime, instead robbing a bookstore and even running practice jobs on one characters parents home.
Ultimately this movie is about friendship and cameraderie, and all of the strange ways we try to fit in.  Definitely worth seeing.",4.0
"""Bottle Rocket"" lacks the focus and maturity of Wes Anderson's two later films, ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", but it is nonetheless a satisfying and often very funny film. Based on a short film that director/co-writer Anderson made in 1994, ""Bottle Rocket"" tells the story of three 20-somethings who aspire to be thieves.
The comparison to ""Reservoir Dogs"" that appears on the cover is without basis, in my opinion. There is little grit or darkness to Wes's film. There's next-to-nothing in the way of violence or true obscenity (the things that often turn me off to Tarantino's films). It's colorful and bouncy, which is a good way to describe Dignan, the offbeat character played by co-writer Owen Wilson. It's the finest comedy work I've seen from Owen.
It's also (along with ""Tenenbaums"") the best performance I've seen from his brother Luke, who plays the protagonist Anthony. Luke's performance is subdued and also, very funny. The brothers have great chemistry together, and are able to make each other's performance more entertaining.
Robert Musgrave rounds out the trio and gives a delightfully quirky performance as the awkward one who endures constant abuse from his brother. He cements his place in the group simply because he is the one who has the car. James Caan and Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana also deliver energy and comedy in their supporting roles.
""Bottle Rocket"" is a wise film, and it makes a nice companion to the two aforementioned Wes Anderson films that everyone has seen. It is wise, fast-moving and extremely funny, although certainly not to everyone's tastes.
The DVD from Columbia/TriStar is completely featureless (not even a trailer), but it displays the film's colorful palette with a crispness and fidelity that is most satisfying.",4.0
"""Bottle Rocket"" is the first film written by Luke Wilson and directed by Wes Anderson, the duo that would later go on to create both ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".  Despite the fact that this is the first film that these two worked on together, ""Bottle Rocket"" is every bit as good as the more recognized and well known follow-ups.  This film marks the introduction of a very unique and original brand of humor, a type of humor that can possibly be mistaken for drama if the viewer isn't paying close enough attention.  This is not in your face comedy, but rather a subtle, quirky sense of humor delivered in a deadpan style that in its own way is extremely rewarding and enjoyable.
The film itself features great direction, music and acting. In particular, Luke Wilson's portrayal of Dignan ranks among some of the most complex comedic performances I have ever seen.  As for the rest of the cast, the performances are funny, heartfelt, and sincere.  This combination of emotion adds a realistic dimension to ""Bottle Rocket"".  This is a funny film, and comical things continually happen to the characters, but it is humor that seems to exist somewhere in the real world.  ""Bottle Rocket"" does not focus soley on comedy, but incorporates aspects of everyday life into its story.  Wheareas most comedies must go over the top to provide laughs, in essence creating cartoonish characters that could never really exist, ""Bottle Rocket"" proves that real life can be just as funny.",4.0
"This is really a film classic and one of the better ones.

Travis Bickle (Robert Deniro) is a loner cab driver who loves working the night shift due to his insomnia.  During the course of his rounds, he becomes obsessed with a young political operative, Betsy (Cybil Shepherd).  He is a rather strange guy and ends up taking her to a porn movie on their date.  After this bizarre behavior, she wants nothing to do with him.  Unfortunately, he is obsessing on her.

His preoccupation with Betsy leads him to a deep hatred of pretty much everything after she dumps him.  One of his targets is the presidential candidate for whom Betsy is working.  Bickle decides to assassinate him.

Meanwhile, he becomes enchanted in a non-sexual way with 12 year old prostitute Iris (a very young Jodie Foster).  His anger at the poor treatment she receives leads to other consequences.

This is an interesting look at alientation and loneliness of some of the fringe people in big city life.  This is a rather extreme case of it.

All in all, this is well done and quite entertaining.",4.0
"*Taxi Driver* is an excellent movie featuring superb acting by DeNiro, Foster, and Keitel.  The cinematography is fantastic in that its combination of lighting and location sets perfectly the mood.  The story is important in that it served as a warning when American society began changing drastically (i.e. nuclear familial breakdown) from the late 1960s - mid 1970s.  Its ultimate message is correct in its asessment of spiritual isolation's consequences (as well as the results of unjustified violence).
  The movie, however, goes too far in its acceptance of youth exploitation.  Keitel's character, a child's pimp, is portrayed as somewhat caring and paternal.  As another reviewer noted, ""he is not a monster.""  Such is dangerous acceptance (even if only intellectual for the movie's sake) of a vile practice which should never be tolerated under any circumstances.
  Anyone who abuses children in any way (especially sexually, physically, or emotionally) for any reason (especially in a rational way for financial gain) is nothing short of a monster.  While vigilantism is also not acceptable, those who hurt children should be prosecuted to the fullest legal extent.  They should never be portrayed as anything other than what they are; selfish, abusive, and cowardly.
  Foster's character portrayal has a serious flaw; while she is supposed to be 12 years old, she is actually depicted as an adult.  This film would have viewers think Foster's character is not really being abused or exploited, as she independantly decided to begin prostituting herself.  The film further implies that attempts to rescue her are in vain, as she has already lost her innocence and cannot return to a normal girl's life.
  That characterization fails to consider an extremely important premise; 12 year-old children do not have the maturity, experience, or soundness of judgement to decide they want to be prostitutes. Such is the entire basis for all minimum age laws (be they sexual consent, alcohol purchase/consumption, driving, or voting related).  As children cannot rationally decide they want to be prostitutes, any adult who partakes of this activity in any way is an accomplice at the very least.
  Furthermore, not all those who want to help child victims are deranged lunatics looking for an excuse to shoot people or use violence.  Helping the powerless is what being a good person is all about.  This movie would have people believe anyone who wants to protect the innocent or offer a helping hand has serious psychological problems.  How ridiculous!
  Finally, giving up on lost children is not the reasonable answer.  While underage prostitutes will have obviously lost much innocence and will not be their pre-street selves if rescued, there is no excuse for allowing their continued abuse.  Coal miners trapped for extended periods after cave-ins often must live with serious mental problems if rescued.  Would it therefore make sense to argue they should not be rescued because they will not be their original happy selves?
  While this is a great movie, please watch it with the understanding that child prostitution is inherently abusive and should never be condoned.",4.0

Like other troubled heroes of the era, Travis is an ex-Marine, working nights as a New York taxi driver, observing with increasing disgust the human flotsam that comes into his cab... His attempts at human contact are a failure... An icy political worker whom he takes on a date (Cybil Shepherd) is repelled by his taste of porno films...

"Martin Scorsese, the writer/director of the Taxi Driver, has admitted that this film is the cathartic result of a bevy of dark thoughts that surrounded his mind during a very low period of his life. By the time the credits finally make their merciful way on screen, we can see exactly what Scorsese saw during those days and the residual effect it has on us, the viewers, will likely stay hauntingly familiar long after we have watched the conclusion of this film.

PLOT:

Tavis Bickle, a taxi driver and volunteer for a New York City political campaign, has tried it all. He's attempted doing things the right way, treating people with kindness and women with respect. Nevertheless, he is ignored and his chivalrous advances continually stepped upon or altogether discarded by one person after another. It is when Tavis realizes that he will forever be average and overlooked that he decides to make drastic changes in his world. Almost at once he begins driving the most dangerous portions of New York in his taxi, scouring the nighttime landscape with his mind cultivating a solution to his own personal, dark problems. Soon, his decision becomes conclusive: he will become a vigilante, and his first offering to the world will be in aiding a young teenaged prostitute by providing her a way out, no matter what it may cost Tavis personally in the process.

Perhaps Scorsese's most poignant film, The Taxi Driver offers a bleak, but somehow refreshing, alternative to the concept of ""taking it lying down."" Here, in his vision, there is another solution, and one in which while many of us fantasize about, almost all of us refuse to make a reality.

However, as the story unfolds, their dreams and visions are set into action in a most feeble manner, and it seems like their ability to dream is grander than what they can accomplish.

It was easy to see that Robert Deniro was going to be an amazing actor from this film.  I caught most of his movies from the 80's and 90's so he was a seasoned actor by then.  In Taxi Driver you could see the rawness and hunger in him.  Loved it.,4.0
"1976 was a funny electoral year. One year after the full defeat in Vietnam and the evacuation of Saigon on the run. Two years after the resignation of Nixon, to avoid an impeachment that would have led to the very first conviction of the President. 1976 was the year when all had to changed, and nothing really changed because the establishment just looked for a way to save face and restore the everyday standard imperialistic power, and of course that will fail with Jimmy Carter, but Scorsese could not know it though everyone knew that success would be a miracle. What's more, success in that line was doomed in the long run. It was not yet possible to know what was going to happen in China, but we could know it was going to change, even if it was quite clear that the Soviet Union was not going to change at all, even if we could not know the industrialized feudal soviet system was going to fall down the chute, was going to be flushed down the drain. That was what Scorsese meant with his crossroads but he did not know how many roads there were in that crossroads nor where they led nor of course which one to take. But one thing was sure in those days: the US were going to take a road that did not lead to any confrontation with their real historical mission which is to create democracy through freedom in a system that had to improve itself all the time because it knew perfection did not exist in this world, be it only because perfection is divine and cannot be found in a non-divine world, in a human world, what's more in a human sinner's world. It was sure the US were not going to face their historical fate and their inner problems and their inner challenges like for example the racial problem, like for example the education of their young, like for example the control of violence, like for example a health care system that was more than necessary. The film is a vague echo of that particular challenge with the allusion to the welfare system, because that was where the US stood at the time: helping the poor. But Warhol had already exposed that problematic solution by showing in his films how vain, hypocritical and corrupted the welfare system was in the US, and that could not be an objective for the US, an objective they could put in their constitution in the form of a new amendment, the only way to really improve the system is by making it constitutional since then to repeal such an amendment is particularly difficult. But the film has aged tremendously since today the US have reached the end of that road, the bad road they chose in 1976. They are deep in the mud of a new war (the Buddhist have a nice saying about elephant getting caught in mud) that has been rejected by the world from the very start, they are confronted to the emerging of a world power they will have to share responsibilities with sooner or later so let it be now, the famous BRIC, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and that has to be done straight away since that BRIC is already the first economic power in the world and will be the first political power in the world within a few years. What's more the US is deeply agitated by the necessity to finally come to terms with the racial divide and the racial problem, by the obligation to provide all Americans with a full health care system, by the duty to provide every American with the possibility to educate themselves even if the government has to cut the military budget to do that. The good old three objectives of equality, good health and education in a system that would recapture freedom and democracy, both having been impaired and limited in the process of the US negating history in order to impose their own self centered epiphanic power. But what does Scorsese envisioned beyond 1976? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The system was defeated in a way. That's why the film has aged since the US and Americans finally have the chance today to be able to choose the road that would lead to their finally getting to political adult age.

"Even if Bottle Rocket had no merits of its own, it would be worth watching to see the beginning of what I hope will be a long and lasting working relationship--that of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson (and Luke).  Like Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, their follow-up films, Bottle Rocket is a wonderful mix of deranged humour and quiet sadness.  The drama always stops just short of heartbreaking, and the comedy just short of slapstick, leaving us only with a bunch of characters we care about, and their crazy, messed up lives.
Bottle Rocket is not flawless.  I'm not sure why not, just as I'm not entirely sure why its so close to flawless.  But it has a wonderful screenplay, full of such lines as ""Bob's gone, he stole his car!"" or, in response to one characters depression that his eight year old sister thinks he's a failure, ""She thinks your a failure?  What she ever do with her life that was so great?""  The romance between main character Anthony and the Paraguayan housekeeper Inez is touching, as is the sometimes uncomfortable friendship between Anthony and the bonkers-in-a-sad-kind-of-way Dignan.  Scenes stay in your memory, like Anthony and Bob watching the retreating Dignan through a fence, or Dignan handing a sparkler to Inez.  The cast is great, from Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson (Owen is always an obvious standout, Luke is the type who you appreciate more with each film you see him in) to Robert Musgrave as the hangdog Bob and Lumi Cavazos as Inez.

"With BOTTLE ROCKET the Wilson Bros. and Wes Anderson launched their impressive careers. And no wonder, for this film is a delight to watch. It's completely devoid of the cynicism, brutal violence, and pop-culture-ridden cliches of mid '90s filmdom. I completely fell in love with Owen Wilson's acting, his comic delivery and utterly sincere reading of Dignan, was like nothing I'd ever seen. Of course Anderson & Wilson's script, though nowhere near as astute as RUSHMORE or THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, is the real charmer here. They are the Dynamic Duo of scriptwriting today, it's too bad Oscar didn't notice that this year. I look forward to their future collaborations and solo projects.",4.0
"BOTTLE ROCKET is an exceptionally fresh and thoroughly fun movie. I found myself smiling throughout, and not even sure why. I can't even say what kind of movie it is. For BOTTLE ROCKET defies any attempt at classification, any assault on its originality and creativity by placing it neatly in a box. It is neither a comedy nor a drama; not a love story nor a crime flick. It blends all of these genres--along with a pinch of classic Americana--into a very unique, delightful movie. Yet it is also a deliciously messy enigma: a loosely strung-together melange of brillance and childishness, high and pop art, profundity and absurdity. By the film's conclusion, I knew I had seen something special, a truly inspired and deeply personal work.
BOTTLE ROCKET's power lies in its characters. They are so quirky, so unique, that they seem unmistakably real, and therefore patently likeable. They are simple people who lead quietly extraordinary and beautiful lives, people who believe in following one's dreams, chasing after true love, being individuals--and all with childlike wonder, innocence, and joie de vivre. In short, they are people of unique and genuine character. They also happen to be hysterically funny. BOTTLE ROCKET, while I would not categorically call it a comedy, is easily one of the funniest movies of the nineties. The brothers Owen and Luke Wilson give laudable (although not flawless) performances as the two principals, and they are supported admirably by some great character actors.
BOTTLE ROCKET is also a beatiful picture. The photograhpy is excellent--stylish in an understated way--and this adds an element of class to an already quality piece. Almost every shot would make an excellent photograph, full of rich and subtle detail, and interesting interplay of colors, textures, and distances. BOTTLE ROCKET does not have lavish sets, nor does it take place in exotic locales. Anderson instead transforms what would otherwise be lacklustre settings like rural Texas and a cheap motel into places of almost otherworldly beauty. The lighting has a lot to do with this effect, giving the movie a very clean, bright feel--think of a J.Crew ad, only set in the rural Midwest instead of a Cape Cod beach house. The movie gives the warm, uplifting feeling of a young, free, and beautiful America, a feeling one gets at certain times reading Kerouac. The music is superb to boot, as in all Anderson's flicks, and greatly enhances the visual experience.
Yet BOTTLE ROCKET falls short in its bid for perfection. For one thing, the love story, while sometimes touching, is very artifical and abstract. At times I really wanted Inez and Anthony to get together, but I couldn't help but feel manipulated by the forced nature of their love. Anthony instantly falls in love with the motel housekeeper, who doesn't speak a word of English because she's from Paraguay. The love-at-first-sight gimmick only works when the characters develop a fulfilling emotional bond over time, but this doesn't happen in BOTTLE ROCKET. Also, I think Anderson indulges in the 1960's motif a bit much. From the music to the sets to the hairstyles, everything reeks of the sixties--hell, even all the cars are vintage. There are points in the film where one could easily forget it was made in '96. The ending even reminded me of COOL HAND LUKE. But BOTTLE ROCKET, I've learned, is a very subjective experience and therein lies its genius, at least in part. If you have a well-developed eye, you'll probably like this film, with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The movie's much like a bottle rocket, in fact: it can spark, sizzle, and delight, but in the end, you're not sure whether it could have had more substance. Final note: the DVD is bare-bones. Can't we get at least a commentary, people?",4.0
"As its title indicates, 'Bottle Rocket' is a desperately sad comedy about confinement and the reach for liberation.  Framed by men incarcerated in institutions accompanied by friends, the film switches expertly between perspectives and patterns - from wide country spaces to cramped interiors whose very shapes seem to offer yet another wall to kick against; from hope-fuelled plans to inept executions; from the need to settle down to the desire to escape; from children to adults, friends to lovers, play to work; from comedy to tragedy, the ideal to real, fireworks to damp squibs, trust to lies, innocence to experience.  And, for genius director Wes Anderson, from the limitations of genre, to the messy, vibrant open-endedness of emotional experience.
If the characters in 'Bottle Rocket' were children, the whole thing would seem a lark.  A young man, Anthony, is released from a mental hospital, where he was rocovering from 'exhaustion'; he is met by his high-wired friend Dignan, who bombards him with blueprints for the next 50 years of their lives.  They plan a heist on a book store, bringing in a rich friend, car-owning Bob, frequent victim of his beefy older brother's bullying.  This is intended to impress the Kafkaesque figure of Mr. Henry, a landscape-gardener-...-ganglord.  They cross states 'on the lam' for a while, where Anthony falls in love with Inez, a cleaner from Paraguay with little English.  Bob, his brother arrested for drug-dealing, goes back with the car.  Frustrated by failed love and broken dreams, Anthony and Dignan have a fight, Anthony returning home to relative normality.  Then Dignan turns up in a yellow boiler-suit, with the big plan that's going to turn their lives...
The film is full of play, silliness, mucking about, kids pretending they're big men, their failures eliciting laughter and sympathy.  Anderson's fluid but fidgety style, true to the needs of his story, but employing all manner of stylistic variations, approximates his young heroes' vitality, imagination and restlessness, while the family intimacy of cast and crew spills into the performances.  Because these aren't kids, though, because their lives are slipping away, because their dreams far outstrip their means, the larks stop being funny.  The true hero of the film is not the compromising Anthony, through whose developing eyes we watch it (the nocturnal, neon-pool love scene at the motel is a hymn to quiet rapture, quickly intruded on by his friend), but Dignan, a man out of time (and, let's be honest, mind), a man with ambition, big ideas in a little land, a straw target easily unstuffed by burly policemen; a man who needs space, confined.
Although it wasn't especially noticed at the time, 'Bottle Rocket' now looks set to join 'Citzen Kane', 'They Live By Night' and 'Badlands' as one of the great American debuts.  It has the spaciousness, generosity, inbuilt mystery, feel for America and stylistic depth that could see it grow.",4.0
"Bottle Rocket is a film by Wes Anderson, who, along with actor Owen Wilson wrote this fantastic film full of smart humor and unique directing.  Everything done in the film is intentional, such as the outfits worn and the colors used in the background.  Anderson's unique visual style along with Owen Wilson's hysterical comedic delivery make this film an absolute keeper.  It stars 3 would be criminals who hold up a bookstore and then run off and hide in an unknown remote hotel.  The trio leaves at a burst of catastrophe which involves one of the characters brother who has trouble with the law.  The end result is a final commission from a big wig thief (James Caan) whom Owen Wilson's character idolizes to rob an old factory.  The story drags a bit at the hotel sequence, but the hysterical finale makes it all worthwhile.  I must mention as well that the characters are great and very unique in that each of their personalities has something massively easy to remember.
  The dvd has no extras, and seeing as the film is spawned off of a 30 minute short of the same name, it would have been great to see some extras treatment.  Comparitively, the commentary track and extras that were piled onto the Criterion Collections ""Rushmore"" dvd make you wish even more that ""Bottle Rocket"" could have gotten at least something(Anderson and Wilson's commentary in ""Rushmore"" open the eyes of the viewer to so many great things that most likely would have gone unnoticed..how much more for this one!).  Yet as it stands, I think we are lucky this film is on dvd at all.
  The music is wonderful, completely unique, and adds to every scene.  The humor in the movie is comparable to Anderson's other film ""Rushmore"" as well as the hidden gem ""Safe Men"" in that it is very dialogue driven.  Fans of ""Tommy Boy"" or ""Ace Ventura"" may not enjoy the humor quite as much.  It is like ""Waiting for Guffman"" in that the first time you see it you may laugh out loud a bit, but you will quote the movie for weeks after.  The second viewing is always the best, and each time after I have noticed different expressions from the characters and laughed in many different places.  So give it a try and check out something new.  This is Owen Wilsons first movie, Wes Anderson's first feature film, and it is the first of (hopefully) many collaborative efforts to come.  Also check out ""Rushmore"" and the soon to be born ""Royal Tenenbaums"".
I gave the dvd 4/5 stars due to the lack of the extras, but the print is clean, it can be viewed in either wide or full screen, and the movie-though not flawless-is one of a kind.",4.0
"I didn't see this movie until thirty years after it's release, but that's fine by me.  I don't think I could have handled it in my teens or even my twenties.

DeNiro is wonderful as Travis Bickle.  The world has already worn at him, and we see it wearing at him further at each stage of the movie.  When he tells the Presidential Candidate that the whole city needs to be cleaned up, we feel his emotion.

The one bright point of his life seemed to be the character played by Cybill Shepherd.  This is the part that got me out of my chair.  When he convinced her to go to a movie with him and then took her to a porno film, I said ""What was he thinking?""  Then it hit me - he isn't thinking the way I think.  This man thinks on a parallel plane to the rest of the society he sees.  And even that type of thinking devolves into a form of psychosis as the film progresses.

One more point.  Other reviewers have seen DeNiro's character as a vigilante who got fed up with the scum pushers and pimps.  I will only buy that to a point.  Remember, this is a guy who armed himself to the teeth, practiced dry-firing his guns at the television and was set on assasination.  There was as much trouble inside him as there was on the streets he loathed so much.",4.0
"If you are in the mood for theme-park ride, don't watch this movie. This was one of my two favorite passed-over movies of that year. The other was 'Hard Eight', Paul Thomas Anderson's prophetically excellent early ouevre. Bottle Rocket is delightful because it speaks to a simpler, more distorted vision of the world. Don't miss the wonderfully quirky James Caan cameo, and enjoy early charming performances by some very capable actors.",4.0
"Viewing ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time recently I'm struck by the feeling that I'm seeing it out of context, and that it suffers by my comparison of it to more recent films rather than films that were its contemporaries.  While ""Taxi Driver"" is a societal-cultural touchstone I never felt compelled to see it and having seen it now doubt I would rush back to see it again.  That's not to say it's a bad film, but it is difficult viewing.  Director Martin Scorsese certainly captures the nihilism, ambivalence, angst, dislocation, and malaise of the 1970s to a tee.  Having grown up in that era, I remember that all too well, and in that respect ""Taxi Driver"" is a depressing drive down a memory lane I'd rather avoid.  The characters also lack nuance or much depth: DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a stereotypical ""damaged goods"" Vietnam veteran (which I found profoundly insulting), Peter Boyle's Wizard is a hard-boiled, heat-packing NYC cabbie, Jodie Foster is an equally stereotyped drugged out/addled prostitute, and Harvey Kietel's pimp/hustler borders on an ugly ethnic stereotype you'd only find in a movie of this vintage.  All border on two-dimensional caricatures and are almost over-the-top.

The thing that bothered me most (and perhaps that was Scorsese's intent) is the amoral ambivalence Scorsese presents here.  Politicians are bland and interchangeable, uttering empty platitudes, government is the problem and the solution, Travis is a psycho and a hero.  The movie is fairly drenched in shades of gray rather than the moral certainties of black and white - and perhaps that's Scorsese's intention.  ""Taxi Driver"" was a departure from the Hollywood oeuvre that came before it with obvious heroes and villains.  The end result is a movie that unsettles and causes us to question the nature of good and evil.

While ""taxi Driver"" is not a movie I'd care to see again anytime soon please don't misconstrue that to mean I didn't think it is not worth seeing, because everyone should see it.  Out of context ""Taxi Driver"" is hard to sort out and feels more like camp or a send up of the whole 1970s genre of gratuitously violent films.  ""Taxi Driver"" is far deeper than that as Scorsese forces us to move beyond our Manichean obsessions over the concepts of good and evil.",4.0
"Lighting is simply magnificent, camera movement is amazing and yet again Martin Scorsese collaborates with Robert De Niro to make an amazing film.",4.0
"I saw this when it was in the cinameas, it was just in the indie/arthouse one actually which no longer exists. I recall it being witty, interesting & different. 2 brothers go on the classic American roadtrip, wanting to be bankrobbers galore & it doesn't always work out. They stay in an apartment complex in some little town where there's a pool & the main character falls in love w/ a girl that lives there. An older man is looking after them, sorting out their schmese or something & the other brother is a bit more maniacal & has a penchant for yellow jumpsuits & motorbikes. It was 5 years ago that I saw it so my recollection is a bit vague. All the more reason why I should see it again. I'd recommend it anyway.",4.0
"I first saw ""Bottle Rocket"" on the independant film channel while in New York. It was about three o'clock in the morning and I couldn't sleep. I flipped on the telly and looked for the closest thing to interesting on. It just so happened that ""Bottle Rocket"" was the first thing to catch my eye, so ""Bottle Rocket"" it was. Once back home, I couldn't stop telling everyone about this charming little flick I had seen. After I had begun to annoy myself with telling the plot over and over again, I decided that it was probably smart to buy the thing and get it over with. It was a choice well made.
""Bottle Rocket"" is one of those movies that can take place anywhere, any time and with any slew of characters. It's simple. I guess that's why I like it. The appealingness of it all isn't really the fact that it was psycologically stimulating but that you can relate to each and every one of the characters. Beyond the mental instabilaty of Dignan or the obsessiveness of Anthony you begin to see three friends, each with many flaws, trying to make it in the harsh real world. I suppose that's the only way to describe ""Bottle Rocket""...Real.
I found the lack of special effects and expensive stuff made the movie better. You focused more on the lines and the plot, rather than the great car and two billion dollar explosion that just errupted. Think of it as cinimatic cleansing.
It's a great story about getting out there and getting dirty. Doing what humans do best....living life.

"I want to commend Stanley Allen for his review on this site.  He suggests that the closing scenes are imagined by Travis Bickle as he is dying.  They include the gratitude and respect of Iris's parents, and the return of Betsy, who he now gets the better of by rejecting her instead of the other way around.  I didn't see it that way as I watched the film, but I see it that way now.  Those are exactly the scenes Travis would imagine.  That is exactly the kind of hero he would like to be.  Respectable, desired, and the savior of a young girl who will now go back to school and be good.  It's hard to tell which he would get more satisfaction from - being invited to dinner by Iris's parents or being adored by Betsy.  I think he'd pick Iris's parents.  This makes him a true hero, a clean hero.

The interview accompanying the movie as a Special Feature is very informative but too long, an hour.  We learn that the teenage prostitute that Iris is based on is really in the movie.  She is the girl who is with Iris.  She looks like a drugged out whore, and that's what she is.  She looks like she has dead shark eyes.  I've seen lots of junkies with those same dead shark eyes.  Iris looks very innocent by comparison.

Iris is a very cleaned up version of a teenage whore.  She is unrealistically cleaned up.  She is palatable for the movie audience but she is unrealistic, as she herself knows, as her mother knew when she saw the script.  Likewise, her pimp is not the original pimp written in the script.  Her pimp is a white man, and not really unlikeable.  He never hits her, he gives her a lot of affection, he holds her head tenderly and whispers to her sweetly, he has a sense of humor.  The original pimp in the script was black, and pimps are known for brutality.  This is almost a Disney pimp, if we can imagine such a thing.

As for Travis Bickle, he's nuts.  You want to root for him, but you can only do that to a point because he is nuts.  He is extremely well played by DeNiro.

I thought that Travis took Betsy to a dirty movie because he is stupid, not realizing that it is inappropriate for a first date with a respectable girl, but the interview explained that Travis wanted to sully Betsy even though he was obviously drawn to her because she was clean.  I overrated his stupidity and underrated his deviousness.  Since I didn't ""get it"" the way it was intended, perhaps DeNiro and Scorsese didn't show it as they wanted to.  I can't be expected to read his mind.  That's their job.

I highly recommend this movie.  I don't always recommend classics like this.  I often punch holes in them and rate them 1 or 2 stars.  This is deservedly a classic.",4.0
"In Taxi Driver we see a classic De Niro performance in a bizarre evironment. If you like the sort of movies that don't seem to have much point after watching for the first time, but it really means you have to watch it a few times to get the ""juice"" out of them, this is one for you. We're taken into the life of a taxi driver that gets fedup with the filth in society and that ends up as a hero by mistake.

Quite good!",4.0
"OK - I went into watching this movie with dread as I was being forced to watch it by my three eccentric friends with whom I ussually have very little in common with in terms of artistic choice. However, this movie was beyond and above that and was so gripping in the simplicity of its tale that I couldn't help but smile, laugh and cry in amusement as the story unfolds. There are so many lines that are now standard in the conversations between my friends and I, perhaps the favorite being, ""Kumar's lost it!"" If you're going to take a chance on any movie this year, let it be this one, and watch it a couple of times - you'll like it, I assure you.",4.0
"This is a mostly well written, acted, and nicely filmed wacky movie.  There is nothing deep here just a few bumbling young robber friends.  The  problem is only one of them wants to really be a great robber and he is a  complete moron who can't even keep a job mowing lawns.  Another is just  trying to impress his jerk brother and the third just wants to be a good  friend and find a chick to love.
The result is a hilarious series of  poorly executed robberies, mostly robbing people they know.  The last  robbery is so over planned and yet completely miscalculated it becomes an  absolute mess.  I laughed so hard and for so long at the last robbery I  almost passed out from a lack of oxygen.  This is a fun film with two  endearing lead characters.
The only criticism I have is the time spent  on the love interest.  It seemed contrived and added as filler.  I suspect  the short version is better because it probably severly underplayed or  didn't include the love interest at all.  But that is really a minor flaw.  James Brooks had a hand in the making of this film and the result is  something to be proud of.",4.0

"I was really quite surprised with this movie- didn't think it was going to be this good. I think to really understand this movie you have to look quite carefully at Travis- I think two things really drove him to do what he did in the end...first of all he is of course fed up with the grittiness and grim of society...and then I also think the extent to of which he experienced loneliness was also very, very obvious. He's searching for love in all the wrong places...and doesn't know why.

I think the movie delivers several powerful messages...one of which someone already mentioned- taking matters into your own hands and doing what you want to change things around you that you don't like-and then also I think it pointed out very blantely how much people put on a front- when really inside there lives are filled with things they hate. I think this was obvious in Travis's life and Iris's life and also probably true of Betsy's life also.

Gotta say I love, love, love scene #15- ""you lookin' at me??"". That was just great, I've played that scene over and over again many many times.",4.0
"Great motion picture. No point going into the plot; you know what it's about.

My only beef is with the ""tacked-on"" unrealistic ending. Bickle as hero? Give me a break.

One of the reviewers claims that this is only happening inside Bickle's mind (right after the shoot-out) ...I can't say more from fear of spoiling it for those who have yet to see this powerful flick... I will only say that I doubt Scorsese and Shrader are that clever to have thought of it. Say, for the sake of argument, that that's what they meant and intended...well, then, I'd say it's pure genius on their part. However, I doubt it.

I still maintain, unless Bickle is spinning this resolution inside his noggin...it does not work. But, if he is fantasizing...it is absolutely appropriate.",4.0
"It's fascinating reading the divergent opinions of Taxi Driver, both here and among working critics; what's fascinating is that I tend to agree with most all of them!

When this film made its initial theater run in 1976, I was totally blown away (no pun intended!) by its unique cinematic style; a sort of introspective color noir dripping with modern operatic expressionism.  We experienced the salacious and gritty Big Apple street life from the cynical perspective of an alienated young cabbie--manifested through Paul Schrader's dark introspective first-person narrative, the sheen of Michael Chapman's surrealistic night cinematography, and Bernard Herrmann's alternately pensive and powerful scoring--brought together beautifully by director Martin Scorsese's obvious feel for the subject and milieu. It managed to strike a chord with many in the midst of the post-Watergate era...and unfortunately struck a wrong chord with a certain John Hinckley, but that's another story.

The ""romantic"" opening slo-mo shot of a yellow cab emerging from a cloud of billowing steam to the progressively rapid beating of a one-handed snare drum sets a dark underlying malevolent tone, and for the most part, that tone is maintained through to the end credits. We meet Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a twenty-six year old ex-Marine who suffers acute insomnia and harbors an utter contempt for what he perceives to be the filth of his urban surroundings and all the depravity it engenders. He takes a job as an all-night hack in a bid to quell his anxiety. The tone is interrupted only by Bickle's inept attempts at social intercourse, especially with a beautiful ""uptown"" campaign worker named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd, whose presence reminds one of no less than Claudia Cardinale's idealized woman in Fellini's 8 1/2). However, the viewer always senses Travis's lingering malevolence just beneath the surface.  A chance meeting with Betsy's candidate gives him a brief but prominent locus for his frustrations, what can't be given by his colleague cabbies (including Wizard, memorably played by Peter Boyle), but it also eventually gives him a locus for a misdirected ""sense of purpose"". Later, another female/male pairing engages this ""purpose"" as Travis tries to befriend a pubescent prostitute named Iris (a young Jodie Foster) who works under the ""aegis"" of a slimy pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel).  The narrative eventually boils to an explosively violent climax.

Though I found the personae of both Ms. Shepherd and Ms. Foster somewhat off-putting and incongruous, their respective characters serve the narrative well.  A Betsy who's a little less ""ideally beautiful"" and an Iris who's a little more mature would have suited the tone of the film much better, in my opinion.  Travis's abject social ineptitude belies his Marine training (A porno flick on a first date?  C'mon!), not to mention the absurdity of Betsy having anything to do with Travis in the first place. (I never knew Kris Kristofferson could so warp a beautiful woman's senses!)  One could point out a myriad of such incongruities in Taxi Driver; but I must admit that the possibility of the film's coda being Travis's dying fever dream never crossed my mind. It would certainly make more sense than a straight literal reading and puts an added interesting spin on it.  Any shortcomings aside, the film's sheer ""cinematicism"" is truly a wonder and a reason to have it in one's collection.  De Niro's portrayal of ""God's lonely man"" is one of the most memorable in late twentieth century American filmdom, only to be surpassed by him a few years later in Scorsese's masterpiece Raging Bull.",4.0
"Director Wes Anderson's BOTTLE ROCKET is the living proof that you can still present a comedy without being vulgar and without having to destroy 40 cars in 90 minutes. And it works.
Wes Anderson does have a peculiar  gift. He is able to give life to the strangest characters and make you care  for them. The hero of RUSHMORE and Luke -Anthony Adams- Wilson in BOTTLE  ROCKET are uncommon guys, so naive in the way they are apprehending the  outside world that you cannot but smile while following their  adventures.
I strongly recommend you this movie if you want to wash your  eyes from the turpitudes of today cinema.
A smart DVD.",4.0
"Taxi Driver is obviously a classic.  It has inspired numerous filmmakers and further established the career of Robert De Niro as one of the preeminent actors of our time.  The story is about Travis Bickle (De Niro) who, to quote Pauline Kael's review, ""has no point of entry into human society.""  Bickle turns to his violent fantasies after a campaign worker (Cybill Shepherd) rejects him- and thus his final attempt to connect with other people.  This culminates in a famous scene of heinous violence. But just because a film is about disconnection doesn't necessarily mean that it has to diconnect its audience.  Ultimately, that's how I felt.  Here's why.

-It's meandering.

This is a film with many shots- carefully planned and technically beautiful shots.  But at times, they seem to exist in of themselves and not to further the story, the character, or the mood.  The shot going into a foaming glass of alka seltzer being just one example.  These shots eventually add up and contribute to a sense of tedium.  Also, the endless scenes of De Niro in his apartment eating cereal, practicing with his guns, or watching TV start to feel like exercises, revealing little that we don't already know.

-Travis Bickle is inexplicable.

In order to watch for 2 plus hours essentially a one-character tragedy, that one character has to be interesting.  As Schrader's script is written though, Travis isn't as compelling as he should.  De Niro's performance is good, especially in his early scenes when his social ineptitude towards Cybill Shepherd's character is sweetly endearing (he takes her to a porno theater on a date and can't figure out why she's offended).  And when he says to his cabbie friend (played by Peter Boyle) that he's worried about ""bad ideas"" you see a man slipping from sanity, while at the same time trying to preserve his morality by ""saving"" a young prostitute (Jodie Foster). These short scenes of De Niro interacting speak volumes, and it's unfortunate that Scorsese and Schrader primarily chose to depict De Niro through his rituals, which as I said earlier, have little nuance and feel static.

With that all said, there's enough good in Taxi Driver to obviously warrant a viewing.  A few examples:

-The New York City setting

Everything about this film evokes the scuzziness of New York City in the 1970's.  Scorese films the potholes, hookers, pimps, and porno theaters with such contempt that we fully understand why Travis hates it.  The place is a sewer, and the pimp (played by Harvey Keitel) that Travis targets is a symbol of how hellish the city is.

-Jodie Foster

I really liked Jodie Foster's supporting performance as the 12-year old prostitute, Iris.  She's only in a few short scenes but she captures the innocence-gone-bad that Travis so despises.  In one scene, she's just a regular kid, eating some toast and giggling, and yet she's been thrust into this disgusting world.

-The Palantine Subplot

The artificial stump speeches of presidential candiate, Senator Palantine and the septic bourgeois banter between Betsy (Cybill) and her friend (Albert Brooks) is chilling in an odd way.  It's as though the political campaign symbolizes a ""civilized"" and benevolent society, and yet it is completely oblivious to the hell that is out there, and thus allows the Irises and Travises of the world to suffer.  One of Palpatine's talking points is ending poverty and crime.  And yet, when he talks to Bickle in a cabbie by chance, his phony political good-guy schtick is perversely transparent, and it's clear that he isn't interested in genuine connection- which this film argues- propels crime and violence.

Anyway, I recommend seeing Taxi Driver.  It's a good movie- a bonafide classic.  It's not as emotional or visceral as it should be, and falls into tedious lapses, but that doesn't detract from the influence it has had or the power it still can have over audiences.",4.0
"Martin Scorsese has outdone himself with this film. DeNiro brilliantly portrays Travis Bickle as a slowing down spiraling taxi driver bent on ""cleaning up the city"" through violence.

This was a great movie from director Martin Scorsese. This was the first time I ever saw this movie and I was very impressed with how well Scorsese handled it. Robert De Niro gave one of the best performances of his career in this film and it's definitely worth seeing just for that. Jodie Foster was great in her supporting role, even if her character is so controversial (she's a child prostitute). All of Scorsese's films have this certain controlled madness to them. I think you can see it in this movie most of all, but it's also very apparent in his most recent film, The Aviator. He's so good at dealing with psychological disorders in his characters.

"Taxi Driver shocked movie audiences when it first came out in 1976.  People gasped out loud at DeNiro's graphic and casual reference to what went on in the backseat of his New York taxi. People were also extremely shocked by Jodie Foster playing a hardened twelve year-old prostitute. There is a gory bloodbath at the end. By today's standards, Taxi Driver is not very shocking; there is so much sex, gore, violence, and shooting in movies today that people are used to it. Nevertheless, Taxi Driver was a groundbreaking film.  Many movies after it have used its themes and style.

In 1976, New York City had a parade of prostitutes, pimps, and porno theaters.  Twenty-seven year-old Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) gets a job driving a cab, primarily because he can't sleep.  He is willing to drive ""anyplace, anytime.""  The former Marine and Vietnam Veteran is a loner, interacting awkwardly with the other cabbies and with Betsy, a girl he falls in love with (Cybil Shepherd).  Betsy is a campaign worker for Senator Palantine, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president.

DeNiro strides into the campaign headquarters and charms her into a date for coffee.  He then takes her to A PORNO THEATER, innocently thinking that because he has seen couples there, that this is an appropriate place for a date.  Betsy storms off.  DeNiro's confusion at her anger is a clear sign that he is mentally unstable.

Betsy refuses to see him anymore.  This is the catalyst that sends Travis over the edge.  He purchases every piece in a ""traveling salesman's"" arsenal, and pumps his thin body up.  He is planning something big.  To the viewer's horror, you realize he wants to assassinate Palantine to get back at Betsy, even though Palantine rode in his cab and DeNiro even has his posters in his apartment.

DeNiro then meets twelve year-old prostitute Iris (Foster).  he wants to save her from her pimp, Sport, played by Harvey Keitel, and her life as a prostitute.  Keitel looks and acts so much like Kevin Spacey does now, you have to see it!  It is unreal.

Every movie fan should see Taxi Driver.  Martin Scorcese, the director, also has a cameo and some of the most graphic lines.  And you get to see a young Ray Romano's ""Dad,"" Peter Boyle, as seasoned cabby ""Wizard.""",4.0
Great film but I don't understand how Bickle walks free after murdering 3 people?,4.0
"Director:  Martin Scorsese
Cast:  Robert DeNiro, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle.
Running Time:  120 minutes.
Rated R for a scene of extreme violence and language.
All of us have known, in some shape or form, how Travis Bickle (played brilliantly by Robert DeNiro) feels.  There is a time in every person's life in which he/she feels isolated from the world, perhaps out of place or unjustly a receiver of misfortune.  Travis, on the other hand, is consumed by this sense of loneliness and despair, taking it to the brink of pure destruction and maniacal proportions.
DeNiro is hauntingly right on as the former Vietnam veteran who decides to get a job as a taxi driver for the streets of New York City.  As he cruises the big-city landscape, he realizes all of the hidious crime, starvation, murder, death, and macabre that consumes society.  When he is rejected by a love interest (Shepherd) due to his out-of-the-norm behavior, Travis begins a downward spiral:  he begins to train as if he were still in the military, buys numerous firearms and weapons, and ultimately plans to stage an assasination attempt on one of the political candidates planning to take over the city.
When Travis meets a twelve-year old prostitute (Jodie Foster, in a extremely profound and witty introductory performance), his motivations for violence and release are geared towards the awful individuals who have taken this poor girl into their possession and are encouraging her into a filthy profession.  This hatred for filth causes Travis to explode, creating a tormenting, horrific climax that will be remembered as one of the most severe in film history.  ""Taxi Driver"" is certainly an acquired taste and not a film for all adults.  It is a strikingly honest tale of how the inner troubles of a man can be extremely exaggerated, to the point that he knows no boundaries.
Director Scorsese uses dark camera angles and vivid images to portray his story, incorporating a musical score that embodies the essence of the film: an unoffensive saxaphone that dwindles into a deep, resounding boom.  A film that can shock and chill, one that should be celebrated for its original genius, but also a work that is almost too graphic and emotionally-draining to enjoy.",4.0
"Whoa!! Fireball performance by De Niro, competent direction by Martin Scorcese and good supporting performances by Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel - all the elements which worked together in bringing out this classic.
De Niro is the lonely guy who takes a one-way ticket to the loony bin when he is shunned by the world. The world around him is too busy to take notice of him and his loneliness turns into frustration, then into desperation and culminates in psychosis. He becomes in hell-bent in rescuing a young prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her way of life and shoots up some pimps and low-life along the way. That is Taxi Driver in a nutshell, but what makes this great is how all the actors literally live their roles and make us feel as if they are just on candid camera. You feel a bonding with De Niro since once in a lifetime, everyone goes thru this patch of neglected loneliness.
The DVD specials consist of the usual fare - making, storyboards, trailers etc. There was some problem with my DVD and I couldn't see the 'making' completely. But it was good till the point I had seen, so no gripes. Get the DVD!!",4.0
"Taxi Driver
Plot: Viet Nam vet Travis Bickle drives a cab in NYC and is slowly driven mad by
urban decay.
Review: Believe it or not this is the first time I am seeing this movie. I heard the rumors
about how good it is so I  got the DVD to find out. The movie starts out slow but slowly
gains steam. As we get to know the main character it builds up to a violent climax
well worth the wait. So you will either like it or hate it because of the violent nature
but you will not soon forget it. 4 stars for the movie 4 and1/2 stars for the DVD content.",4.0
Outstanding performances in this hardest hitting British film for many years. Winstone is superb as drugged and druken wifebeater. Possibly an eye-opener and very true-to-life film which will intentionally disturb.,4.0
"The soundtrack? If anyone finds it, please post here. I check back here every so often in hopes that it might have been released. :)",4.0
"A remarkable film, most so for its unusually realistic depiction of the endless cycle of abuse in which so many women find themselves trapped -- not something one finds in a ""market-tested"" Hollywood movie.  A  refreshing, if bleak departure from fantasy.  Don't bother if you're  looking to escape.
Separately, I would like to add mine to the chorus of  voices desperate to get their hands on either a soundtrack or an album by  Frances Ashman that contains her songs from the film.",4.0
"Nil by Mouth

This is definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting is top notch but I get no pleasure at all from watching the dregs of society - drunks, junkies, wife beaters, bullies & utter boneheads going about their business. Only the women in this film have any sense of morality and right and wrong. The language is strictly from the gutter and adds perfectly to the portrayed pond lives that are using it.
Of course, this is how some people really do live their lives but entertainment it is not. It would make a decent documentary I suppose but as a film I won't be watching it again, nor will it linger on the memory for too long either. Once is quite enough!",4.0
"I will just come out and say it...Do not watch this movie if you can't be open minded and look into the lives of people who have it so bad that you wonder, ""How do they stay together?!""
This is why I LOVE this movie. It is superbly acted, written and presented as a ""Hard look at life.""
It is a difficult movie to watch but you will see that even though drugs and violence can destroy a family, some families survive.",4.0
"A brutal, harrowing film about domestic violence filled with the most swearing probably ever committed to film.

Martin Scorsese's (Robert deNiro) grimy look at life on the raw side as seen through the eyes of the dysfunctional taxi driver. A masterpeace. Sharply written the film is credible to the end.,4.0
"Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' is a most graphic and harrowing tale of loneliness and its effect on the human psyche.
Robert De Niro, the most versatile and talented actor ever in my opinion, plays Travis a man so plagued with insomnia he turns to taxi driving to while away the late hours.
In a job not usually associated with isolation, Travis, a misanthrope, feels a sense of solitude that is almost inexplicable. A man who finds it impossible to articulate his feelings, the slow degenerative process of rationalisation leads him to question his very being. With so much time to think, sickened at the state of New York City, Travis sees an opportunity to be someone - a self appointed bringer of justice.
This is not a pleasant film. In fact, it's the ugly tale of a man's sedulous quest for purpose culminating in extreme, explicit violence.
It's a frightening, grim and true-to-life film; an historic monument in cinematography, but those of a nervous disposition may prefer to give it a miss.
In respect to the actual DVD, it, like most DVDs is impressive. The 70 minute documentary that compliments it, gives a clear insight into the mind of the director and his motives for being involved in such a controversial movie.",4.0
"Taxi Driver dramatizes the all too human condition of loneliness, a human being who moves through maddening crowd, jostled, brushed, ignored, abused, hassle, provoked but who is somehow utterly untouched by any of it because of his secret world of fantasy and his inability to communicate with his fellow humans. In short a lonely man, aching to be noticed, recognized and loved, but unable to attain it.",4.0

"After watching this movie, John Hinckley went out and tried to kill Ronald Reagan. This would indicate that ""Taxi Driver"" is a worthwhile movie. In more basic terms, however, the reason this is such a good movie  is because it shows how close the categories of ""hero"" and  ""psychopath"" are, and indeed, how close these categories are to  normal life.
Travis(Robert De Niro) is a young, lonely, slightly  obsessive taxi driver, who displays in the course of the movie, the two  main male passions - sexual love and fatherly love. The first of these is  directed towards a young professional, Betsy(Cybil Shepherd), a campaign  worker for a Presidential candidate; the second towards a child prostitute,  Iris acted by Jodie Foster.
the first of these passions brings him into  fleeting contact with the cold aloof world of US politics characterized by  empty sloganeering and an absence of policies. By actually meeting the  candidate, Palatine in his cab, Travis begins to instinctively realize the  connection between the messed up New York streets with their pushers and  prostitutes and the opportunism and cynicism of those who defile their  responsibility.
After being misunderstood and rejected by Betsy, these  vague political misgivings crystallize around his dented male pride and  lead him to plot the assassination of Palatine. As he prepares himself for  this, however, his paternal feelings are aroused by the plight of Iris, the  child prostitute, whom he resolves to rescue. Already living on the edge,  he decides that the best way to do this is by killing her pimp.
In his  mind these two goals become almost identical. Killing the apathetic.  patronizing politician, who is socially or politically responsible, and the  pimp, who is individually responsible for the abominations of modern city  life, like child prostitution, have little to separate them. Indeed, only  the candidate's security guards make the difference.
Foiled in his first  attempt, it is only the second of these goals that he manages to  accomplish. Ironically, the courage that would have had him damned as a  sociopath in the first case, allows him to become a hero in the second.
This film raises the question: Is someone who takes a gun and tries to  blow away a President or one of the other fakirs of the frenetic passivity  of ungovernment, a hero? The answer is probably yes.",4.0
"When I first saw this, it was from flipping through the channels and I came in at the violent conclusion when Travis Bickle (De Niro) finally snaps.  I remember being surprised by the graphic violence, it being an  older film.  The story is a little dim and definitely unpleasant at times  but so is life.  I believe that the idea of a man becoming sick of crime  and filthy surroundings and has his boiling point makes sense.  See it for  yourself and try not to judge it based on bad reviews, especially Leonard  Maltin's.  De Niro was great in the film.  *Scorcese plays the nutty guy  spying on his wife.",4.0
"Taxi Driver is one of the most important film in the American cinema of  the 70's . Also, after almost a quater of a century after its release, it  still is an exciting as well as  horryfing experience to see it. What is  discribed in this movie is still chillingly true in our days.

For  Scorsese fans, the Criterion Laser Disc was long thought to be a must-have  item. The transfer used in this new DVD looks quite different from the  Criterion version which was surpervised by cinematographer Michael Chapman.  Frankly, the LD looks better than the DVD, or at least it's more beautiful.

The rich colors of the Chapman-trasnfer is not on the DVD. The color looks a  bit desaturated and often off-balanced. For instance, in daylight interior scenes like the lelection campaign office,  what you see outside the windows are simply too blue. It looks more contrasty and  you loose certain details in the shadow area.  But I do not dislike this  transfer: while the Chapman-trasnfer makes Travis' Urban Hell look a bit  sexier, Hell's Kitchen in this version is tough, gritty and merciless. The  desaturation of colour employed on the notorious ""blood bath""  sequence is more effective in this transfer (By the way, Chapman himself disliked the effect, so apparently he tried to minimize it on his supervised trasnfer). If you have the chance to see  the film on screen with a good print, the effect is devastating (Scorsese  applied the same technique in Bringing Out the Dead, this time throughout  the entire picture) .

The DVD also features an insightful series of  interviews from the filmmakers including Scorsese, writer Paul Schrader,  Michael Chapman, Robert De Niro and the other cast member, and the special  make-up creator Dick Smith. The interviews with the supporting cast,  especially the one with Albert Brooks (who played the presidential election  campaign worker) is particullary interesting.

Another interesting function  is that you can compare the film with the screenplay simultanously, and  understand how Scorsese preserved the structure of Schrader's script while  filling in more details that makes the characters and the story alive. This  DVD is really worth buying if you like the movie. You can see it  repeatedly, and learn a great deal about how it was made. But I think  Criterion should re-issue their version (with audio commentary by Scorsese  and Schrader) on DVD as well (and also Raging Bull).",4.0
"The widescreen transfer of the origional (minus the real reds in the final blood bath - now lost forever-see documentary) is magnificent. Nothing is lost, and the tech. buffs should be happy. The sound is stereo and crisp  (what a sound track) and the 70 min. documentary is icing on the cake, its  amazing how much improvisation there was in this movie.
The movie, well  its early Scorsese, and while not his best, still a real winner. Watch in  particular for the camera movments, angles, and ""daring"" shots  that the film crew were so amazed  when shooting it under  ""Marty's"" direction. Enjoy.",4.0
"The New York city shots are very arty and interesting to look at. The cinematography is very 70's which is a good thing as it captures the style of filmmaking of the time. I think Scorsese makes Bickel out to be the good  guy to show how sometimes even the baddie can be turned into a goodie, hell  just look at WWF! Anyway, thats enough waffle from me!",4.0
"TAXI DRIVER is the un-relenting tale of one man's journey into insanity while driving a cab on the streets of New York City.  The many situations that Travis Brickle (a bloody brillinat performance by Robert DeNiro)  encounters and the many people he meets while drivng this cab at night send  him into a downward spiral of hate and contempt for everyone and  everything.  The fact that he is a Vietnam vet really seems to play a role  in how affected he is by this incredibly obscene and disgusting society.  Being dumped by a woman with whom is incredibly fond of, in addition to  meeting a 13 year old street hooker all further establish as a sort of  morality tale which questions both our society, and the people affected by  it.  The harsh yet mellow aura of the film is sharpley interupted at the  end by an incredibly violent climax which may be too much if you're not  expecting it.",4.0

"For a very long time, this remained on my wish list. Despite its being held in high regard, I feared Fright Night would be a half-witted foray into my favorite genre (the vampire film) since it had a cheesy aura to it and was produced smack dab in the middle of a decade I have no wish to relive. I also was awaiting a rerelease of the Blu-ray version that came with extras: this never rematerialized, so now the Region A Blu-ray is fetching exorbitant prices (perhaps it is being mistaken for the Screenarchives version, which was limited to 3000 copies worldwide).

Sure enough, upon watching I found Fright Night replete with the worst of 1980s culture and topped with Cheez Whiz (the nightclub scene was particularly unbearable). Nonetheless, the special effects are both intentionally and unintentionally humorous, the story mildly creative (although predictable), and the 106 minutes not wasted. Stephen Geoffreys as ""Evil Ed"" was so over the top that he actually was a pleasure to watch, inciting laughter despite what passes as funny in the 21st century. And honestly, the special effects are still commendable for a pre-CGI world, right down to the uncomfortable custom contact lenses made for the vamped out actors. Considering that vampire films need to be graded on a curve, Fright Night remains a work worth watching, if only for some laughs.

The Region Free Blu-ray version (Dutch import) of Fright Night looks fantastic! If considering DVD still, check out this double feature that is currently dirt cheap:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night-Urban-Legend-Two-pack/dp/B001DB6J5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night / Urban Legend (Two-pack)</a>.",4.0
"4 Stars. James Merendino, who hasn't done anything notable but this movie, makes a charming story about the punk culture. In a total 90s filmmaking style, although taking place in the 80s, the movie moves forward and back in time to describe the quirky characters and were their lives will go. Much like Noah Baumbachs 1995 debut, Kicking and Screaming, the movie is about moving on. It retains the society philosophies that were seen in Kicking and Screaming but puts it to an angst and punk soundtrack, which the soundtrack to this movie is quite good. Matthew Lillard stars as Stevo, who alongside his pal, Bob, decide to spend their post college year pissing their lives away, only to realize that they and their friends must move forward with life and out of their unrealistic punk ideals.",4.0

"One of the better 80's horror films, Fright Night takes a slightly new twist on an old story and entertains us the whole way through.

 Charlie spies on his new neighbors and discovers one of them is a suave vampire named Jerry Dandridge, but it's not always easy to convince doubting friends, and Charlie has a hell of a time getting his pal Evil Ed and girlfriend Amy to see the light. The addition of Charlie being a young teenage horror fan was pretty clever on Holland's part. Because of his fascination with the dark side, it limits his credibility when he start spewing off about ancient vampires right next door.

 Unfortunately time is running out and Jerry knows he knows, and knows he knows that he knows he knows. And yes, something in there makes sense. In desperation Charlie tries to get the help of a horror monster show host Peter Vincent (nix the name Peter Cushing and Vincent Price). Things don't go as planned but the guy grudgingly agrees to try and assist; from then on we're on our way to a knee-jerking climax.

 The major strength of this film lies in Christopher Sarandon's bi-sexual portrayal of Jerry. This man is a wet dream come true and makes every shot pure gold. He has the personality of old-world vampire charm and it's really a shame I haven't seen him in more horror (although he's been in plenty). Every time he's on the set my eyes remain glued to the screen and my glands start salivating. Maybe I should stop now while I'm ahead...

 His daywatcher/human servant (Billy Cole) is creepy in a way and his cup holds its own volume of twisted charm. Amanda Bearse (pre-Married with Children) shows up as Amy and does a surprisingly good job as a cute, bubbly, and interesting side-character. Charlie (William Ragsdale), the main character, does the role well and his friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) plays the part to a tee but his character is a little annoying. Another great charm is the cowardly vampire hunter Peter (Roddy McDowall) -- he brings plenty of humor when he walks in. A recently fired, non-believer he has to be convinced but when he sees it's real his knees begin to shake and his pants become a little wet but this just makes it all the more comical.

 This movie isn't frightening but it's not meant to be. It does have some nail-biting suspenseful moments -- especially when Dandridge pays a visit to Charlie's house and visits with him and his mother. There's also a good dosage of comedy but never goofy. Lot's of old time spoof nods to past vampire legends and rules of the trade in a flattering, fun way. A nice nod to the 80's, it had some great music that enhanced and never took away from the quality. (Tangerine Dream -- Firestarter; and Brad Fiedel (The Terminator, Serpent of the Rainbow)

 A light, lovable film that causes smiles, groans, grimaces, and overall enjoyment -- definitely a keeper.",4.0

If you haven't seen this movie yet you should pick it up so you can see it!

"Wow! I can't recall the last time I saw so many heated reviews.

I saw this movie awhile back so I'm a rusty review. Pardon me if I miss a few fine points but I can't watch it again. It's just too painful. When I saw it I saw my teenage life in a movie and wanted to just run out of the room. I didn't grow up in SLC but I did get transplanted from a large city into a small Midwest town with a fringe 'punk' scene during the second or third wave of punk. This movie is such a freaking history lesson because it describes a time when there was no Hot Topic (i.e. Punk was subculture and had no real money cashing in on it) and punk was a mostly unwanted subculture. If you looked like these kids during this time period you WERE the enemy, no matter how true your Anarchist morals might be. Just listening to the Dead Kennedy's in public was an act of Communism. See how I didn't say 'act of terrorism' there? Middle East terrorism was a thing of the late 70's so the hatred was against Communism. If you were anti-Reagan and said something as simple as 'what's so bad about collective farming?' in the mid 80's you were likely to evoke some hostility.

And so many look back at the time with the lens of the internet and Wikipedia misguiding their view. You must understand that if punk (a very small and unpopular music genre) came to your town it was through import. Either a friend from a big city brought it or some lone independent record store carried it along with a few odd albums from the 70's, like Zappa, that you'd never heard or cared about. And that was all you got. You couldn't hyperlink from Johnny Rotten to Anarchy and try to figure out what that rally meant. You just saw pictures of the Sex Pistols pissing everyone off and thought, 'yeah, that sounds about right'. Punk was your shield. You may not have understood all it's underlying philosophy (like there's actually one they can all agree to) but you understood the reaction, and that was enough.

Now here's the next kicker that strikes me as a little funny. It's odd that people can't fathom two people can experience the same phenomenon differently or have a different take on it. Being a punk in say NYC 77 would have been much different than being one in 86 insert small Midwest town, '81 Manchester England or '82 Los Angeles. This movie can't capture every 'punk' experience or perspective everyone had and it shouldn't. What it does well is describe the isolation, outcast and sometimes bizarre lifestyle proclaiming yourself a 'punk' might put you into. The scene with the drug dealer where he's shooting the car hoping to sink it in Great Salt Lake wasn't exactly my personal experience but it wasn't too far from the 'anything could happen so watch out' feeling I had when I proclaimed myself a 'punk'.

I knew someone like every single character in the movie during my 'punk' phase, and while I didn't become a lawyer I did look back on it all as an absurd but necessary coming of age transition set to a very angry soundtrack (my personal soundtrack had Husker Du's 'Zen Arcade', Black Flags 'Who's Got the 10 1/2' and DK's 'Fresh Fruit' playing most of the time). Again, ALL of this was too insane to live one time around and watch a second time around.

What really struck me as profound is Steve-O's girlfriend who points out how punk is just another uniform. Maybe the movement didn't start out that way but we all know that's all it became. It pains me to see what my friends and I used to call 'safety hawks' sported by people trying to look trendy just as much as it pains me to see motorcycle guys riding around wearing Harley gear. It's too cliche' to have any meaning or impact any more. When punk got corporate sponsorship a'la Hot Topic it said it's final death knell. It sounded kind of like this: ghhgghgghgghhh! Ghaaahhhh. Gehhhhehhgggh! (cough, cough, roll on the floor dramatically).

Was Steve-O a poseur? God, how we threw that term around way back when. Well, how punk is 'punk'? What is punk? Is it the crybaby Clash of 'Sandanista' bleeding a left-leaning heart out for some idiotic third world problem I have no clue about or is it the thrash of Greg Ginn's guitar solo against a sea of seemingly mediocre music? Do you have to run for office as a joke, like Biafra, and keep up this anti-right atitude for life no matter how annoying (again, Biafra), or do you have to keep your hate face on like Rollins? Or were you no longer punk if you weren't hanging with the CBGB crowd in the mid-70's? What if you weren't in a band? And what about those God-Awful skaters that would hang around like  flies on punk's rotten corpse, are they punk? Is it all about fighting authority? What if you become an authority on fighting authority?

Lux Interior (the Cramps) would tell Steve-O, and you for that matter, 'You ain't no punk, YOU PUNK!' After throwing away enough of my life to some silly movement that expressed my anger quite vividly I'd say Steve-O was  just as punk as anything else that came down the pike. I'm just glad he had the sense to move on and not let an art fad become his life. That's right hanger on-er's. Punk was just one big art fad. Time to let go and find something else or find nothing at all.

Great movie, F-You.",4.0
"Fresh and engaging look at punk rockers in Salt Lake City in the 80s.

The thing that stops it from being great was that, while it did have a good ending, the mechanics of the ending were not well-thought out.  Heroin Bob's death was just an accident, a fluke.

I think the director was trying to get away with implying that Heroin Bob's death was a natural result of the boys' crazy, chaotic lifestyle, but instead it was a mere happenstance the way Bob died:  it could have happened to anybody.

Thus making it seem like the lead character's doubt and malaise culminated in the destruction of his friend was a bit of artistic legerdemain that I believe film critics will cite as detracting from the greatness of the movie as a whole.",4.0
"I was 15 when this came out and it was during that time when slashers were no longer in vogue and Hollywood started doing these inane and insulting horror-comedy hybrids.. This was one of the better ones and it worked well..

It's also interesting to note the scenes with Amanda Bearse acting sexually frigid seems interesting now, considering she came out 10 years later.. and due to a sagging mainstream career after 976 Evil (1989), Stephen Geoffreys hit the gym and switched to making hardcore gay xxx porn (after he came out).. Now where's the E! True Hollywood Story on this one??  Anyway, Fright Night is a good 80's flick... the sequel, not so great..

I purchased the DVD back in 2006, when Sony had updated and remastered it in High Def... It doesn't look half bad on my Blu Ray, and it's sold, here, on Amazon, for like $10.00..NEW. Yes, I know, it only has the Original Theatrical Trailer, and it's ""JUST"" in Dolby surround sound (for you perfectionists).. BUT I don't care, 'cause I'm not paying $350+ for ANY movie. Especially one still readily available on DVD.. (Twilight Ltd Edition""numbered"" Blu Ray). I pitty da fool who buys it for that price. Ha!",4.0

"SLC Punk is about a couple of punk/anarchists stuck in the middle of conservative, Mormon-dominated Salt Lake City. This is a pretty good film, as long as one bears in mind that the kids in it represent more of a ""lifestyle anarchism"" than a political philosophy, and as Stevo (the main character and narrator) self-consciously admits at several points, their actions and attitudes often stand as a flagrant contradiction of the punk ethos they espouse. While the movie does not accurately portray the ""authentic"" punk or anarchist philosophy, it does accurately and poignantly portray a widespread, popular bastardization of it, so it still creates relevant social commentary. As a coming-of-age story, it is poignant and affecting, particularly as tragedy descends upon Heroin Bob, ironically named for his aversion to needles and drugs.

Throughout the movie is an undercurrent of dissonance between an anti-oppression philosophy and the characters' aimless,testosterone-fueled adventures. While Stevo and his friends rail against ""fascism,"" they glorify violence and act in ways that perpetuate the ""macho"" dominant culture. Fights are a way of life, and in one scene, Stevo (who claims earlier that ""nobody owns anybody"") catches the woman he likes with someone else and proceeds to beat the daylights out of the rival, who he accuses of ""invading his territory."" A less obvious irony is Stevo's...well...patriotism! He goes to great lengths to extol the superiority of America's punk scene, in one instance harassing a singer from the UK who's been roughed up by Stevo and other patriotic punks.

An excellent soundtrack adds another layer to the realism of the film.",4.0
"Sometimes it occurs to me with a jolting shock that I've seen a lot of films in my life. Many of these, like this one, were with my roommate in college, who was a certified movie freak. Although I forgot about it until I recently bought it for myself, one of the movies I liked a lot back circa 1999 was SLC Punk. As it rapidly segues from hilarious to touching, tragic to gross, ultimately SLC Punk shows it has a message beneath its surface noise, and it says a lot as it unfolds. At its center SLC Punk asks the question ""is buying-in always selling-out?"" To translate that for the uninitiated, that means is following cultural norms always a betrayal of personal identify and youthful dreams? Stevo and his best friend ""Heroin"" Bob (who ironically never touches drugs and is terrified of needles) are two young men living in uber-right wing Salt Lake City during the mid-Reagan years. They do their best to be hard core punks in a time and place where that pursuit separates them from just about everyone else in their Mormon dominated society. Steveo, though, is more than he seems. Amid his binge drinking, ambushing of local rednecks, and philosophical asides on the healthiness of personal anarchy, Steveo, it turns out, is a brilliant student who has the chance to get into an Ivy League college. His father, a smooth-talking Yuppie jerk, does his best to persuade his son to accept the Harvard education open to him, even as the life Steveo believes in proclaims that path to be the ultimate in ""selling out."" Along the way between its memorable opening scene and its closing credits viewers of SLC Punk meet a cast of characters that includes a rebel who disguises himself as a conforming prep, a trust-fund Eurotrash psychopath, a hippie Wiccan woman, and, well...one case of skin infection so bizarre it even stumps medical science. SLC Punk is worth seeing, owning, and heck, even spending ten minutes reviewing on Amazon.com. So go get it. Go get it now.",4.0

"A well-meaning if not slightly flawed film that is still highly recommended in the usually unwatchable wasteland that is the punk rock movie. The action centers around two lovably antagonistic protagonists, Stevo and Heroin Bob, as they try to verify personal truth in the unlivable (to them) wasteland of Salt Lake City in 1985. The fact that the pair are, at the time, the only ""real"" punks in the straight-laced Mormon metropolis allows the film to build upon a philosophical foundation of contrasts.

Within the madness and mayhem, certain scenarios allow larger issues to be argued; dualities discussed include punks vs. hippies, violence vs. peace, ""real"" punks vs. poseurs, chaos vs. structure, and anarchy vs. fascism. Some very good questions are both implicitly and explicitly asked, such as ""Does violent anarchism become fascism when it seeks to impose its value systems on others?""

And though most of these questions are answered with what amounts to a cinematic shrug, it is done in a knowing, wink-wink kind of fashion, as if the filmmakers are well aware that no solutions are being provided, and that it's only important that the viewer ponder the paradox. In other words: ""think for yourself.""

The only problem I had with the film is that it seems to, in places, equate punk with mindless violence, a cultural construct and media myth which has been in place since daytime talk shows reached out to the violently disenfranchised youth of America and said, ""Punks are messed up and need makeovers."" And the youth bought in.

And though I usually despise films that trumpet their soundtracks as a reason to see the film, in this movie the musical cues work really well, both in content and placement; not only are classic tracks by Exploited, the Stooges, Fear, the Ramones, the Vandals, the Velvet Underground, Adolescents, and Dead Kennedys featured, but oftentimes they are included at very appropriate points in the plot. The best example of this is when Minor Threat's ""Look Back and Laugh"" begins playing as Stevo contemplates his loyalty towards his best friend Bob. (For those of you not in the lyrical know, the words go, ""One day something funny happened, but it scared the s--- out of me/Their heads went in different directions, and their friendship ceased to be.""). But the real kicker is that the track is pushed back in the mix before the second part of the lyric kicks in, so in order for the musical cue to make any real sense, you have to know the song on your own. Nice.

Also rising above the mix are the performances by the lead actors, Matthew Lillard as Stevo and Michael Goorjian as Heroin Bob. Lillard transcends his usual one-note snarkiness to create an actual character, and Goorjian makes Heroin Bob (so named because of his fear of needles) one of the most likable - nay, lovable - characters in recent memory.

The commentary track on this DVD is somewhat entertaining but not particularly incisive - I was definitely expecting more insights from director/writer James Merendino, but he comes off somewhat disjointedly and nowhere near as thoughtful as the film he himself wrote and made.

What saves this particular commentary is the engaging verbal sparring of Matthew Lillard (who enters the commentary late 'cause he overslept - VERY PUNK) and Michael Goorjian (who has to leave early to catch a plane - NOT VERY PUNK). They spar with and complain to Merendino about the director's sometimes-unsafe, seat-of-the-pants filming technique, Lillard's mugging and each other's acting choices. That makes it worth a listen, but if you're looking for deeper insights into the film, you'll come away slightly disappointed.",4.0

"SLC PUNK is an entertaining romp through 1985 subculture with sarcastic, disillusioned, and sometimes volitile main characters as the social environment into which we are immersed. The reason this works so well is that it gives viewers a unique look at life from a very disorganized and idealistic viewpoint. The main character, Steve, and his friends all seem to have very idealized views of what the world should be and they are forever comparing it to the poor quality of their actual surroundings in Salt Lake City.

Through short backstory pieces, we gain a sense of characterization and motive for each of the main characters, although their motivations may be at once alien and unclear. Still, this is one of the qualities SLCP has going for it: however confusing, terrible, or reckless the characters, they are truly real. Honest-to-goodness people. They're messy, annoying, endearing, profound, and fun depending upon the scene. Far more fleshed out than most Hollywood characterizations, the people in SLCP can affect viewers because of their flaws. Sympathy is gained through watching them make stupid decisions or ones that seem poorly thought-out.

The plot at the beginning is admittedly a little rambling. It is clever that the movie takes place in so few backdrops and yet each scene has its own feeilng of ""space."" Social hierarchies exhibited in the punk subculture, deviance as defined by Steve and his friends, and the fine line they walk between true self-expression and parody are all themes dealt with fairly well.

Perhaps the only flaw in the movie is a lack of precision. Understandably, the plot is somewhat haphazard in its progress: after all, this is about real life with these characters, not a constructed plot. However, the damage occurs when characters go off on somewhat unbelievable tangents and then go off to do something that has little relevance to the rest of the plot.

Despite its flaw, the movie is a gem when speaking of characterization and dialogue. The organic quality of the lines adds to realism. The individual characters connect with the audience at different times throughout the movie. Viewers will likely find themselves saying, 'I've often had the same worry' or 'That makes so much sense to me.' These characters have many of the same flaws and insecurities that likely lurk in our own minds.

The treatment of two themes drive the movie and make the most lasting impressions. They are the desire to leave a mark on the world and to find one's place in the book of history; and, the desire to understand and synchronize with others.

Finally, the last act of the movie is profoundly moving, a new high point of brilliant writing, talented acting, and atmosphere. Do not pass this movie up: the message, the acting, and the characters are excellent.",4.0
"This review is strictly on the movie itself, not the DVD.

Fright Night, a 1985 horror film that combined the elements of horror and comedy, is another winner from the 1980's and is one of the best films that the decade had to offer.

This film offered a unique perspective from the point of view of a young man who lives in a very peaceful neighborhood, who one day, discovers that his new neighbor living next door is an actual vampire.

The film starts with a young man named Charlie Brewster(William Ragsdale)watching his favorite TV show, called Fright Night, with his girlfriend Amy Peterson(Amanda Bearse)when he hears and sees that there is a new person living next door that is strangely moving in during the middle of the night. Soon, after seeing a familiar face on the TV news, that of a known prostitute that he saw the previous evening and also, after accidently witnessing his neighbor Jerry Dandridge(Chris Sarandon)with fangs and about to bite a young lady on the neck, he realizes that he has a vampire living next door to him and tells people that he knows about it and the reaction that he gets is one of disbelief. After surviving an attack by his neighbor, where Charlie stabs his hand with a sharp pencil and in revenge, the vampire totals Charlie's classic Mustang. He first goes to his some time friend ""Evil Ed"" Thompson(Stephen Geoffreys)and asks him for advice on how to defeat and destroy the vampire living next door to him. Also, in desperation, he turns to his hero, the host of Fright Night, Peter Vincent(Roddy MacDowall, may he rest in peace), who was a big star in early films as ""The Famous Vampire Killer"" and hopes that Mr. Vincent will believe him and hopefully, help him do something about him. After a few failed attempts, Mr. Vincent accidently discovers that Charlie's neighbor is indeed a vampire as Dandridge cast no reflection in his pocket mirror. After that, Dandridge decides to go out and follows Charlie, Evil Ed and Amy throughout the town. Evil Ed abandons them and winds up becoming Dandridge's victim by biting him. Charlie and Amy try to hide out in a dance club, but Amy winds up under the spell of the vampire and doesn't notice that Dandridge casts no reflection and after a scuffle in the club that has Dandridge kidnap Amy and orders that Charlie and Peter Vincent come to his house if they ever want to see Amy stay a mortal, but it is actually a trick as Amy has already been bitten and it is up to Charlie and Peter to stop Dandridge before he does it to somebody else or the rest of the human race. Again, I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might not have seen this movie as of yet.

Writer/Director Tom Holland effectively blends horror and comedy together to create a very unique viewing experience. The film will scare the daylights of you and will have you on the edge of your seat, but will also make you laugh a little because this film does teter on the edge of spoof. It doesn't skimp on the scares nor does it skimp on the laughs as you will both be scared and be laughing a little as this film entertains very well. The film is well acted, well written and wonderfully directed by Tom Holland as he keeps the pace going and the action never lets up until the bitter end. Tom Holland works wonders with his script and his direction. It all works. It is a fun filled scary and funny movie that never gets dull no matter how many times you watch it.

PROS: The DVD has the movie looking great with the audio sounding terrific. The soundtrack also sounds wonderful. The film is available in both FullScreen (Side 1)and WideScreen (Side 2)

CONS: No special features like a commentary by the crew, cast or both. No behind the scenes featurettes and no interviews by the cast and crew reflecting on their time working on and making the movie and the fun that they had working on it. The only feature is the theatrical trailer for the movie. I suppose that the theatrical trailer is better than nothing, but still, it would have been better if the DVD had a lot more to offer.

Despite the shortcomings, it is wonderful to have this classic 1980's film on DVD.

I watched this back in 1986 on HBO while spending the night at my sister's house and I enjoyed it immensely. Years later, I would buy a VCR and I would buy this film on VHS, alongside it's sequel Fright Night Part 2, and I still enjoyed it as much as I did when I first saw it on HBO. I now have the DVD and that is great as well. I still enjoy this film immensely as this film is a very entertaining movie from both their respective genres and from the decade that it was released.

Overall, Fright Night is one of the best films that the 1980's had to offer and also, one of the best horror films ever made. If you are a fan of horror, comedy or both, this movie is for you and if you saw this movie back in the day and enjoyed it then, get the DVD so you can rediscover it and enjoy it once again. No fan of horror, comedy or both should be without this classic film of the 1980's, which helped define what the 1980's were all about. This is must have for anyone who loves films of the 1980's and lovers of horror films, lovers of comedy films or both.",4.0
"If you're going to appreciate ""SLC Punk,"" the 1999 film by writer/director James Merendino, you need to have grown up during the 1980s. The film, taking place in Salt Lake City in 1984, hits all the right notes when documenting rebellion and music of the period. The lifestyles, attitudes and different cliques which spun off from American punk rock have been accurately detailed. Most importantly, the story transcends the era, revealing the frustrations of youthful rebellion and the angst of American suburban living.

There's a thread connecting ""SLC Punk,"" ""Quadrophenia,"" ""Easy Rider"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause."" The protagonists are cut from the same cloth - different eras, same story. ""SLC Punk"" has also been compared to other films detailing punk rock, most notably ""Suburbia"" and ""The Decline of Western Civilization."" ""SLC Punk"" comes far closer to the emotional truth of this 1980s American subculture. I related to almost every scene, though found the ending to be melodramatic. Why can't characters evolve due to changes within rather than the tragedies of others?

To see the beginnings of punk rock, all one has to do is view the extraordinary Sex Pistols' documentary ""The Filth and the Fury."" The anger and the music eventually spread to America, reaching such humble burgs as, according to this film, Salt Lake City. Fights with rednecks or frats were commonplace, and this is properly detailed. The chaos of concerts in small venues highlighted by thrash dancing and stage diving is expertly portrayed. The all-night parties, where wildly diverse styles including Nerds and Mods mixed with Punks, are recreated to great perfection.

""SLC Punk"" documents all of this with a feverish style. The film is narrated entirely by our main protagonist Stevo, brilliantly portrayed by Matthew Lillard. This was the Reagan era, in which a movement to return to old values and traditions alienated the seeds of Woodstock. The styles of punk however, were eventually as rigid as a Southern frat house, and this is noted in ""SLC Punk.""

In ""SLC Punk,"" we are much closer to our parents than we care to admit. This is emphasized during Stevo's hilarious conversations with his father, a former hippie turned lawyer who has ""bought in"" to the system. Played by Chris McDonald, he accepts his son's rebellion and tries to understand. Dad's a bit lost, but his love for his son is never in doubt. It's a multi-dimensional portrayal which is a highlight.

The final conflict of ""SLC Punk"" comes at a rapid pace, the spiral begun by an impromptu acid trip in a park leading to yet another all-night party and a drug overdose. Stevo doesn't leave the punk scene more than he evolves, as most of us do in life. There's a tendency by hardcore faithful to downgrade this film because Stevo transforms rather than giving the world the finger. He reaches his breaking point, splintering off into his own individualism. It's an oddly touching moment, spiced by an incredible flashback as Stevo takes Rush off the turntable and plays Generation X for the first time. Suddenly, the road becomes clear.

Who among us cannot recall instances from youth in which everything made sense - the translucent flash when the path cleared and we witnessed our definition? Moments like this are painful to watch because they are so truthful. Youth is pain, and ""SLC Punk"" is a uniquely executed slice of it.",4.0

All of these reviewers who bother to whine and moan about how ""not punk"" the movie is... why?  Didn't the characters and the film itself seem to mock the ever-present ""punk/not punk"" war?  SLC Punk doesn't try to be hardcore.  It doesn't really appear to TRY to be anything, aside from a lovely look at the confused nature of any radical philosophy:  the blind rush for money and prestige as well as aimless rebellion.

"SLC Punk! (James Merendino, 1999)
Matthew Lillard, in the main, makes mediocre movies. So when I stumble upon something like The Curve or SLC Punk!, I find myself pleasantly surprised. The boy IS capable of acting, he just doesn't seem to do it all that often.
SLC Punk! is the deceptively simple tale of two punks, Stevo (Lillard) and Bob (indie film favorite Michael Goorjian) trying to survive in the counterculture of perhaps the country's most boring metropolis, Salt Lake City, Utah. Professing a belief in anarchy and a general confusion about such heavy topics as drugs, the opposite sex, and what punk really is, the two, coupled with various fringe players, spend long hours cooking up ways to take down the system without ever actually doing so. That is, when they're not partying.
While Lillard and Goorjian are the centerpieces, some of the fringe roles are just as well-acted and engrossing. Star Trek cutie Jennifer Lien plays Stevo's on-again off-again soulmate, while Bob falls in love with X-Files' Annabeth Gish. Christoper McDonald, forever branded with the stigma of having played Tappy Tibbons in Requiem for a Dream, does a minor but wonderful turn as Stevo's dad. James Duval, Summer Phoenix, Devon Sawa, and a host of others all also pop up in minor roles.
Like its main characters, the movie seems to have no direction at first, but ends up being more than just your typical slice-of-life flick. There is meat to these bones, and it's quite fine. Recommended for more than just the novelty of seeing Matthew Lillard actually act, for once. *** ",4.0
"So many reviews on here are talking about how ""un-realistic"" this movie is to the ""real"" punk scene in SLC,  you guys need to get over youselves, this is a great movie. Obviously you missed the last five minutes of the film because it totally proves that this movie's intentions were not to be ""realistic"".
Overall, this is a great movie. It'll make you laugh, perhaps it'll make you cry, but overall it'll make you think. It's very funny and clever, a great watch if you're lookin' for a movie to rent. However, I must agree in the fact that it's probably not worth the 18 dollars that most websites and Hot Topic want you to shell out.",4.0

"I saw the trailer for the unnecessary remake of the classic mid-1980's flick and I am not impressed. I'm not putting it down just because it's a remake; a remake could be good, though I cannot really name one off the top of my head. The trailer just looked boring and Colin Farrell as Jerry Dandridge, the head-vampire, doesn't look the part. I'll give it a rental, but have no interest in seeing it in the theatre.

I saw this original there and got it on DVD for just $2 at a yard sale recently. The DVD's best 'special feature' is simply the movie, as there is nothing else. It has widescreen on one side and full-screen on the other, so that's good for those who have a preference. As well, this has subtitles in the most languages that I have on any DVD on I own. However, watching it with the English subtitles, it seemed that there were many points were there were no words for quite a while.

When Dandridge became the bat, I liked that a lot and, especially when he was destroyed, I thought it was awesome. It had a lot of old, practical effects and makeup that were really good for the time. I'll pick puppetry and classic effects over computerized, fake stuff any day. The remake will most-surely be filled with expensive CGI and that will make it lose appeal for me. However, I love magic and to have the Peter Vincent character be a stage magician instead of a horror-movie host is an interesting idea. Will Mr. Vincent use illusion to trick the vampire into his demise? I think that idea could be used well.

However, Mr. Vincent will not be played by and elderly man, so I think that won't be as interesting. Also, this will be in an over-populated place (Los Angeles, I believe) and that is not preferred. In the original, it took place in 'Anytown, USA'. That gave it a better atmosphere, thinking that it could happen in any common neighbourhood much like the one you're probably in. I hear that Chris Sarandon, who played Dandridge in the original, is supposed to have a cameo in the new flick and that would be cool (yet, most assuredly, it will be too small a part). I hope that the FRIGHT NIGHT theme from J. Geils Band plays a lil' bit somewhere, too...perhaps on a radio station in someone's car? Lastly, concerning the remake, I'm hoping that they re-release the original and the sequel with more features. Specifically FN2 as its cost is ridiculous.

Okay, so back to this flick: it's great.

I don't fully understand the dude who lived with Dandridge. He walked around in the daylight, obviously wasn't human because he was eventually shot multiple times and lived, but a wooden stake through his heart did kill him. His demise was more like a zombie's -- but don't they usually expire when they are shot in the head? When you saw Dandridge's coffin being discovered in the basement, I just noticed that there were two coffin's there. One contained Jerry and the other was open and, I assume, was for the roommate. So...what was that guy? A werewolf in human form? I imagine...and the bullets that Peter Vincent fired weren't silver bullets? Yet can a werewolf be killed with a stake? Whatever...it was still a cool death when he melted into goo and sand.

I was probably more scared as a kid when I watched this; now, it still has some spooky moments but I had 'fun' with it. There's a fair amount of blood, but it's the teeth of the ghouls...noises and sound effects...and eerie locations that add the most to it. It was a bit emotional, too, especially when 'Evil' is dying from being impaled in wolf-form by Peter Vincent and is in the process of converting back to a human. The half wolf/half human and then fully human 'Evil' reaching out to Vincent was something. Roddy McDowall appears honestly affected by this and must feel sad as well as simultaneously relieved that the monster didn't get him. Remember that everything he's seeing was for real and vampire movies were coming to life before his very eyes. He was a fine actor and will always be the genuine vampire killer.",4.0

"First of SLC punk isn't really about punk rock, its about being a punk.  Not in the mohawk being too cool for school sort of way, but rather the not knowing where you want to go, what you want to do, and not sure about society sort of way.
The brilliant thing about this movie is that it captures teenage angst, the way punk rock as a form of music captures teenage angst.  For anyone who has lived the suburban life this movie will seak volumes about you, volumes you may not even realize.  The thing that speaks to me more than anything else in particular is the idea of doing something esle with your life, and punk being a phase of growing up.  At least the posing and posturing being a phase.  While you may leave part of the subculture behind, it is a part of you, and someything that you will never lose, even when you are working in an office someplace in chicago.",4.0

"My brother has been raving about this movie since it came out, so I thought, why not?
Besides my near faint during the opening credits when I found out that Broadway performer Adam Pascal was in this movie (Eddie) I was completely floored by it!
I wouldn't know real punk music if it bit me, and I didn't hit highschool until almost a decade after this movie takes place, but it still holds this almost obscene, cult-like, monumental truth about society and life in general. Well, maybe not that huge. But this is the first movie I've seen in a long time that actually had me come away thinking.
If you're tired of fluff movies made just for profit, watch this movie. If you like Matthew Lillard, watch this movie. If you like punk music, watch this movie (although I get that from my brother.) If you like Broadway, watch this movie. If you remember the eighties with any fondness, watch this movie. If you were dissilusioned by the eighties, watch this movie.
That is, if you're not afraid of thinking.",4.0

"An 80's ""classic,"" FRIGHT NIGHT is a straightforward (and yet tongue-in-cheek) vampire film that doesn't have any real surprises, but which never fails to entertain.  Chris Sarandon mugs it up as the bloodsucker who moves next door, and our teen leads are suitably cute and pathetic as they run around trying to enlist the aid of skeptical cops and the narrator of a nightly horror show called, of course, FRIGHT NIGHT.

There are a few things you might cringe at.  I found the spikey-haired friend (Ebo?  Is that what they kept calling him?) to be shrill and annoying.  And the cheesy 80's dance scene went on two verses too long, but overall I was impressed by the special effects, the dedication to detail, and the fact that the movie never tried to be anything other than a good, old fashioned, fang-flick.",4.0

"Released in '85 `Fright Night' is a wonderfully campy, contemporary vampire tale that was one of the first films to bring the vampire mythos into contemporary times, preceding the classic `The Lost Boys' by two years. `Fright Night' is a bit uneven in the beginning but during the last thirty minutes or so the storyline really comes together and make it all worthwhile. Chris Sarandon makes a great vampire as is Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent, late night host of Fright Night, a weekly television show where he masquerades as a fearless vampire hunter.

This one is lots of fun and stands up well to repeat viewings!",4.0
"Naturally, me being a huge fan of punk rock, I loved this movie. The music was great. In fact the whole story was great. I only have one complaint. The creators of this movie obviously had no clue whatsoever what anarchy or anarchism is. Anarchy is rebellion against the system, government and/or status quo. Anarchism is the belief that the government and system is bad, and should be removed or completely changed. An anarchist is someone who believes in the theory of anarchism and/or performs anarchy. The creators of this movie seem to think that the idea behind these believes and acts were to create chaos. Not true. Anarchists believe that doing this will create a BETTER system. Not a chaotic one like these movie producers think. Many of the so called anarchistic acts performed in this movie were not anarchy. But simply law breaking acts. This distorted definition of anarchy got quite annoying while watching this movie. For this reason a star was dropped.
My favorite part of this movie was when one of the characters was trying to figure out what kind of punk his dad is even though he isn't a punk. He was like ""I know, you're a Nazi!"". Then the dad said. ""What! I'm Jewish!"" ""Oh even WORSE!"". I also liked the part were another character said ""Man, this guy was the most hardcore kid I ever knew. Why I remember one time, when he decided that all the cars on the street would look better without their wind shields. So he..."" I laughed then too. So buy this movie if you are a punk. but try not to get too annoyed with the incorrect anarchy definition. Peace.",4.0

"Vampire movies are almost by definition parodies, the only variable being the degree and the quality of the parody elements vs the scare elements. ""Fright Night"" (1985) is neither the best parody nor the scariest thriller, but it has the distinction of being the all-time best mix of the two. Both its parody and its scare elements work extremely well and their juxtaposition really makes the film worth seeing.

""Fright Night's"" production design will remind you of ""Gremlins"", a contemporary film, but the spirit of the film is more along the lines of Polanski's ""Fearless Vampire Killers"".

Average suburban teen Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) accidentally discovers that his new neighbor is an evil vampire. The vampire is not particularly discrete, not bothering to pull the window shades and disposing of a victim in a plastic garbage bag. Charley unwisely goes public with his accusations. This tips off the vampire that his teenage neighbor may be a threat. But he is still safe because nobody believes vampires are real.

Not only does no one believe Charley but the vampire discovers that Charley's girlfriend Amy resembles his lost love, which makes her a target. Amy is played by a young Amanda Bearse (""Married With Children""), which you will probably find a bit disconcerting for several reasons but it is kind of interesting to see her as a hot teen love interest.

In desperation Charley goes to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the host of the local television show called ""Creature Features"".

The special effects are excellent and not overdone. Dorothy Fielding who plays Charley's airhead mother should get special mention for her excellent performance. One of the running gags during the first half of the film is her failure to find anything suspicious about her new neighbor or his nighttime activities.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only an inner child.",4.0
"If you're into 80s horror movies--especially vampires ones, once you've had enough of Freddy and Jason--then FRIGHT NIGHT needs to go on your required viewing list. Like its younger brother, THE LOST BOYS, this movie is campy as often as scary (which is a minor critique, but a critique nonetheless), but it is also far more traditional.

Rather than the contemporary pack-o-vampires motif so prevalent today (see ""TEETH"", by yours truly, if you don't mind another gratuitous plug), FRIGHT NIGHT comes back to the single domestic vampire with a servant or two, a motif established by Bram Stoker and, more recently, revisited by Stephen King. So, what you have, basically, is a classic tale in modern dressings, decent special effects, and pretty good acting all around. The standout in this movie is Roddy McDowell, who plays Peter Vincent, the vampire killer. Somewhere out there, Buffy's got to be giving this man his props (or at least laying roses and garlic on his grave).

My only lament for this, and its 80s brother in vamping, is the ""safeness"" of the tone. There's so much comedy in both, you often forget to be really scared. Fun stuff, but easy to watch with the lights on or off.

I would like to have seen a better DVD treatment for this forgotten little gem! A great movie to watch on Halloween!",4.0
"I wasn't in the right mood when I saw this, so it took a long time for me to think 'urbane parody' instead of 'why is Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) such a screw-up.'  Most of this was due to a start that got most of its laughs from scenes of Charley ignoring his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) to spy on Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), the vampire who has moved in next door.  The sight gags simply don't work very well and until the film actually develops some dialog it doesn't really shift from 'yet another clich' ridden horror film with a big cast' to 'Hey! That was cool.'

So Charley discovers that Dandridge is lunching on the local joy girls while Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) the ghoul redecorates the nest by painting the windows black.  Charley attempts to raise the alarm, but only manages to convince everyone that he is having a lot of 'teenage' moments.  In desperation, he turns to the local horror show host Roger Vincent (Roddy McDowell) and suddenly the film shifts into high gear.  He gives a one-man demonstration of the acting abilities that have put him in some 250 films, playing a crotchety ex-actor whose nickname was 'The Vampire Slayer,' now reduced to a late nite host with slipping ratings.

McDowell plays the part as frightened man who knows that vampires really don't exist and then discovers that they do.  He squeezes every bit of humor there is to be had out of the part and somehow gets everyone else up to his level.  Just when you think the film is in danger of failing in spite of Sarandon's coolness, McDowell demonstrates that there is still a lot of life in those old clich's.  Fright Night can't help being light weight, but it does manage to be successfully entertaining.  And you get some interesting special effects when people go vampy face or dissolve upon staking.",4.0
"Now, if your not a punk, and have no idea what it is, then this movie will explain a lot to you. I originally bought this for 4 bucks because it has some great music in it, but watching it was a pleasure. The terms have changed through the times (mods are rudies or rude boys), and there are some gaps left out of the punk scene, no skins, but overall it was great to remember what it was like. It captured the no-cares attitude I've had for a while, but it also showed some of the end result, without damning the middle to uselessness. Lillard was great, Goorjian was devilish, I loved their acting. What this lacks in story line, it makes up for in laughs. I've shown it to all the non-punk people I know, and they love it. I have to explain a lot to them, but it's a great insight into the life. I hated to see it end!! This is definitely a great one to watch before going to a show, it released a lot of the pent up tension, and while the punk show they showed was a lame representation of what it's like now, it got the juices going. I wouldn't recommend this if you are a prep, or have something against angst and self-destruction, but otherwise it's great!",4.0
"a charming suprise of a film; SLC performs miracles with it's shoe string budget and stale plot...not that the plot is stale on screen.  The writer/director envigorates the post-adolescent angst formula beautifully...self-depricating and full of truth.  It transcends period piece, the punk movement is just a symbol.  Like fight club, SLC is a tale of a growth: from anti-establishmentarianism to the abandoment of extremism and, like fight club, it is done with reckless abandon.  There are flashbacks within flashbacks; extreme violation of the fourth wall convention and comic book-like expressionist special effects.  It is also like Mean Streets, with its gritty low-budget feel, the intense method acting and directing, and blistering soundtrack.  The opening still is straight out of Goodfellas ""all my life I wanted to be a gangster.""  But most importantly, the film has the pacing that makes both directors so enjoyable...the movie moves.  Also, the direct/actor commentary on the dvd is great (if not essential) and adds a deep appreciation for the film.  The film isn't really groundbreaking but it is a solid success and wholeheartidly entertaining.",4.0

"Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) is your typical teenage boy.  He lives with his mother and has a girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Bearse).  His favorite TV show is Fright Night, which shows horror films hosted by faded film star Peter ""The Great Vampire Killer"" Vincent.

When a new neighbor moves in, Charley notices strange things.  Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is suave and sophisticated and is never seen before sunset.  When some girls start missing, Charley starts to suspect that Jerry might be a vampire.  When he cannot convince anyone else of this, he goes to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell).  Peter, at first, is skeptical, like the rest.  But eventually Charley brings him around.

Charley, Amy and Vincent go against Dandridge.  Of course, you know how it has to end.  This film combines comedy with horror to make a fine hybrid.  Roddy McDowell was a great character actor in early days of MGM (best as Liz Taylor's sidekick.)  This was a comeback for McDowell.

"Here's the thing.  I grew up in Utah and was a teenager in the early 1980's.  No, I wasn't punk, but I see a lot of truth in this movie because I was an outsider of sorts.  I see a lot that a couple people down the line of reviews could not see, could not comprehend.  One such reviewer is too hung up on the music.  If I could show him 2nd South in Salt Lake during the mid 1980's, he would see why SLC Punk is an amazing piece of truth from beginning to end. I see it as very plausible that punks would hang out with those not of their so called ""kind.""  I know because I was one of those who floated in-between the ""tribes"" as the film says.
One funny thing is, the drive out to Wyoming.  To me, it looks like the road out to Nevada, but then, that really isn't important, because there are more important things about the film and the wonderful humor inside of it.  I especially like the essay that Steve O tells the audience.

"Director:  Tom Holland

Cast:  William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall, Amanda Bearse, Stephen Geoffreys.

Running Time:  105 minutes.

Rated R for vampire violence, gore, nudity, and some language.

Rivals ""The Howling"" as the quintessential vampire film of the past quarter-decade, ""Fright Night"" excels even more in the humor department.  William Ragsdale plays Charley Brewster (perhaps the best, cheesy high-schooler name ever), a regular teenager who finds himself emotionally distraught and disturbed in adolescence, but for much different reasons than any of his classmates.  Charley is convinced that his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a blood-sucking, bat-winged vampire and he will stop at nothing to get his friends and family to believe him.

As Charley and his girlfriend (played by Amanda Bearse) realize that his initial perceived nightmare is true, they enlist the help of former television vampire hunter has-been Peter Vincent (in a wonderfully funny performance from the great Roddy McDowall) to bring the vampire-next-door to light.  Director Tom Holland uses a great, clever script to near perfection, mixing the elements of terror and tongue-in-cheek humor to the fullest, making ""Fright Night"" one of the most enjoyable and entertaining horror films of the middle decade.  Ragsdale is innocently exceptional with his performance and Sarandon is perfect as the seducing, scheming vamp.  Very good special effects and some great one-liners.  Can be enjoyed to all movie-goers, not just buffs of the horror genre.  A true campy, cult landmark.",4.0
"Although ""Fright Night"" is considered to be an 80's classic, it is actually more than that. The film is an endearing and energetic homage to horror cinema especially the Hammer productions and the Universal horror cycle. Yes, the film has a humorous tone, but it is not campy nor is it trashy. It is a competently written, stylishly directed and wonderfully performed horror film which features amazing special effects by Richard Edlund (back when effects depended on imagination, not processor speed) and a truly original and haunting score by Brad Fiedel. But the highlight of this movie has to be Roddy McDowall's performance as Peter Vincent (which is Tom Holland's tribute to actors PETER Cushing and VINCENT Price) as his portrayal of the fading horror star who hosts a second rate late night horror show who reluctantly becomes a real life vampire killer, is both terrific and arguably his career best. With an atmosphere that is nothing short of a horror buff's dream, good performances and a terrific, special-effects laden climax, this is a horror classic that is unmissable for fans of horror and especially vampire films. *The Region 1 dvd features a gorgeous anamorphic transfer, but is sadly missing the 5.1 sound remix that is featured on the region 2 edition, however both features the excellent trailer, which is also restored*.",4.0
"Fright Night has all the classic and yes, cliched elements one expects and wants in a tongue-in-cheek, teen/camp or chick horror flick.  It's fun, stylish, has a handsome vamp, heros who keeps trying when the chips are down, and a heroine who has to decide who and what are important to her life.

  Roddy McDowall plays aging actor Peter Vincent (Vincent Price allusion no doubt) who starred in countless horror films as a Vampire Slayer who now hosts Fright Night, a horror movie hour on the local network that could easily have been USA in the 80s or an local yokel station. All his films come to life for him in sickening reality when he is called upon by the teenager Charlie Brewster, an avid fan of the Fright Night show for help in dispatching the vampire next door.

 The vampire next door, Jerry Dandridge is played with fun melodramatic flair by Chris Sarandon,(who was in that other memorable Holland film, Child's Play)  best remembered for his other evil role as Prince Humperdink in the Princess Bride. Dandridge also has a creepy and edgy sociopathic henchman who manages to be scary than him at times. There is an undercurrent of the serial-killer duo between them mixed with a metrosexual edge that leaves you wondering.

  This film does an uncliched legend blaster when it shows that the vampire is a disgusting and revolting. A vampire doesn't love you -- he needs you -- and thus another part of the vamp mystique is exposed to harsh sunlight.

  His hideous transformation starts out with long feminine nails as he shape shifts into a ghastly blood-sucker with a mouth truly like a bat from hell.

 Charlie puts two and two together when call-girls Dandridge orders show up decapitated on the news.

  Of course, Charlie has problems without a vampire or his weird henchman living next door: His girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) has decided she's not ready to lose her virginity, right before Dandridge moves in. Charlie's mom is single. Soon, Charlie's mom invites vamp-o in to their home, and Charlie knows his days are numbered. It's a classic case of invasion, and too many changes for Charlie, psychologically. What I find most interesting is how Dandridge doesn't want to kill Charlie if only he'll keep his mouth shut. In fact, Dandridge shows odd compassion throughout the film, making his character more complex and vulnerable. This vulnerability shows through the most when he is with Amy. I don't really know any other vamps who've offered a chance to walk away, but once again it touches on a malevolent vein of serial killer fraternity. After all, Dandridge had let Charlie watch as he seduced one of the call girls up to the point he began to change.

 At the same time, Amy begins re-thinking her choices because she thinks Charlie's acting strange since she wouldn't have sex with him. In an effort to win back his love, she pays Peter Vincent to fake a holy water test on Dandridge hoping this will get Charlie to leave Dandridge alone. Unfortunately, this is when Dandridge meets Amy. Amy is immediately drawn to Dandridge, more so then the usual victim, and we find out why. She is the likeness of someone he knew centuries ago.

  In irony, she gives to Dandridge what she would not to Charlie . Then again, perhaps it is not so ironic. With the vampire she will have forever, but as she and Charlie are just teenagers there is no security with him. The scene of seduction between Dandridge and Amy shows that it is Amy's choice in the end.

The first time I watched this film I was a pre-teen, and took it very seriously and now that I'm an adult it is sheer fun.",4.0
"40-year-old man watches ""punk"" movie with teenage son. Son decides to be a punker. Father decides to become an Anarchist. No, nothing's quite that simple...
The movie is a great vehicle for exploring teenage rebellion. I had a great time watching it with my newly teenaged son. It inspired him to begin posing as a bit of a punker & a bit of an anarchist. I've challenged him to get beyond the poseur side of things and to delve into art, rebellion, creativity & =REAL= Anarchism.
Enough of bridging the generation gap--on with the movie. I only gave it four stars because Stevo really wasn't punk like the punks I knew. Heroin Bob was. This was a poser movie pretending to portray the punk scene as a transient phenomenon which could not survive maturity. Too bad they didn't do it as a =PUNK= movie--PUNK all the way through the editing process!

"FRIGHT NIGHT

(USA - 1985)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo

Unable to convince anyone that his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, a desperate teenager (William Ragsdale) summons the help of a reluctant TV 'horror host' (Roddy McDowall) to confront the monsters in their midst...

Produced at a time when the American horror film seemed to have lost its way following the glut of low-budget independent shockers which proliferated in the wake of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13th, Tom Holland's FRIGHT NIGHT attempts to straddle the gap between 'traditional' horror and the effects-driven blockbusters which had begun to dominate genre movies in the early 1980's. The plot is a little thin, and there's a couple of items which date the narrative squarely within its decade (notably the disco sequence, and a cringe-inducing theme song by the 'J. Geils Band' during the closing credits!), but Holland's script reserves its major fireworks for a dramatic second half, in which the forces of Good and Evil make their final stand against one another, resulting in a barrage of monsters and mayhem, courtesy of Richard Edlund's superb visual effects.

Ragsdale and love interest Amanda Bearse are saddled with stock juvenile characters, but Sarandon relishes his role as the vampiric predator, toying with Ragsdale as the boy's accusations of supernatural horror are met with incredulity by all around him. However, McDowall steals the movie as a faded horror star whose old-fashioned values have fallen out of favor in an increasingly cynical age, and who finds himself confronted at the end of his career by very real monsters indeed. Though somewhat underwritten, McDowall portrays the man's cowardice, sadness and ultimate redemption with a deftness and clarity that brightens the entire movie.

Some observers have discerned a homoerotic subtext in Ragsdale's obsession with his handsome, vampiric neighbor, and also in Sarandon's pursuit of Ragsdale's high school buddy (Stephen Geoffreys, also known as 'Sam Ritter', star of gay adult movies like VIRTUAL STUD and SEX ON THE BEACH), and while there's some merit in this particular reading, it doesn't get in the way of the slam-bang melodramatics. Geoffreys adopts a range of tics and mannerisms which will infuriate some viewers and endear him to others, but his final sequence - one of the best in the entire movie - is charged with genuine emotion (rendered even moreso by McDowall's extraordinary, wordless performance on the sidelines), and the 'death rattle' which accompanies Geoffreys' departure is one of the creepiest sound effects this reviewer has EVER heard!!...

"I caught ""SLC Punk"" primarily because I had been so impressed with Matthew Lillard's work in ""Hackers"" (see my earlier review). However, I was drawn right into the movie as I recognised myself & many of the people I had known in the early 80's on the screen.
It isn't just personal identification that leads me to recommend this film. ""SLC Punk"" is a classic coming-of-age story about the angry young man too intelligent for his surroundings, questioning the values & lifestyles of those around him. Since JD Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"", every generation has had it's defining story of this type. ""Repo Man"" & ""Drugstore Cowboy"" are earlier movies that came to mind while I watched ""SLC Punk"" for similarities in attitude & style. I was particularly impressed with the cinematography of the ""drug"" scenes; they caught the visual jerkiness of LSD very effectively.
Matthew Lillard's performance as Steve-O was dead-on & very touching. He definitely stands out altho the rest of the cast is uniformly fine (if unknown)!
Of course, the soundtrack rocks! From the ironic anger of the closer (the Dead Kennedy's ""Kill the Poor"") to pre-punk classics by the Stooges & Lou Reed (punk's godfathers) the choices of music are always interesting, if sometimes surprising.

"I enjoyed this zombie apocalypse story. Milla was awesome! Story was fun and plausible, action scenes were cool without being ridiculous. I would watch again.",4.0
"Many consider this sequel superior to part 1.  Im middle of the road.  The action is better but the writing seems worse, with the clich&eacute;s turned upa lot.  Still a pretty fun watch, though.

Narrated by Alice (Milla Jovovich; The Fifth Element, Resident Evil, Ultraviolet), a brief flashback montage catches us up with the story, which picks right up where it left off in 2002 as suited-up Umbrella technicians re-open the Hive.

Like part 1, Alice once again awakens quite scantily clad with no clue where she is.  This time in a surgical gownerrrra piece of one.  LOL. They sure do like having her wake up with a heavy dose of legs and side boob.  She has also clearly been operated upon or the subject of experimentation.  Alice wanders outside the facility to find the streets of Racoon City barrena newspaper headlined The Dead Walk blows by.  Nice touch, right?  We come to find that after her capture at the end of part 1 she had been dosed with the T-virus (a special strain, I suppose), making her a superhuman killing machine.

Picking up where Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) left off, newcomer director Alexander Witt (his only directorial feature, by the way) has turned the clich&eacute;s up hard. Supercop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory; Eragon, The Time Machine) slips out of her heels and into her Lara Croft Tomb Raider gear to solve Racoon Citys zombie apocalypse one headshot at a time in her tight breasty tube top and short-shorts; Carlos (Oded Fehr; The Mummy) likewise receives a nonsense-fueled opening action sequence; and the highly melodramatically written Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris; The Quiet Ones, Poltergeist) wheels out of his McMansion all smarty-pantsish like Professor Xavier.  There is also no shortage of various things random like ridiculous gratuitous acrobatics, zombies rising from the shallowest graves ever, no one ever missing a shot, topless zombie prostitutes, and yet more generally poor writing.

Racoon City is quarantined, trapping all within along with the virus-raging zombies.  Among those trapped is Dr. Ashfords young daughter.  Safely watching from outside the city, Ashford agrees to help Alice and Valentine escape if they can rescue her.  It's all very Escape from New York-ish (1981). Trapped in a city of undesirables, our bad-ass hero is infected with a virus and will find a grim outcome nearing the end of the film unless she can save the daughter of a scientist who waits safely outside the city.

Theres just one problem.  The Nemesis Program (mentioned at the end of part 1) is activated, awakening Alices old buddy who has now mutated into an unrecognizably hulking dreadnought resembling Hellraisers (1987) Chatterbox on steroids.

This sequel, much as its predecessor, features the lamest zombie scenesall phoned in and clearly wastes of film and make-up.  However, once Alice fights the Nemesis hulk, things get REALLY entertaining.  Im not a fan of the 30 Crouching Tiger Jedi jumps, the canned fight scenes, or how thousands of bullets perpetually miss Alice despite having no cover and minimal evasive maneuvers.  But the action sequence is really quite entertaining.  I roll my eyes more here than at the original, and part 1 was clearly better written (in my opinion), but this sequel truly succeeds at being more FUN however over-the-top it may be.

After a better final boss battle than part 1 offered, there is a still a lot to be desired in the fighting photography and choreography.  Even when featuring a hand-to-hand combat action finale, this sequel is clearly more about big explosions and blatant exposition than the quality of anything between. But again, its fun.  And Im grateful that the final boss wasn't another miscarriage of bad CGI.

We end very much how we beganand paralleling how part 1 ended and beganwith Alice recovered by Umbrella, naked (Amen for boobs, right guys?), and yet again the subject of further experimentation by Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen; Game of Thrones, Darkness).  No points for originality, but I enjoyed the ending anyway.  I enjoyed the whole thing.

Much as part 1 ended with the initiation of its sequels premise, so does part 2 leave the doors wide open for part 3: Initiate the Alice Program.  Id say keep going if you liked either of the first two.  Theres nothing particularly thoughtful to be found here, yet still a lot of effort was evident behind making this fun and exciting.",4.0

"Still a pretty fun watch for fans of mindless action and some occasionally decent gore, balanced by some terrible CGI and a lame boss.

I remember seeing Resident Evil in theaters in 2002 (LOVED it; I was 21), again in 2003 after I bought the movie, and once more (rewatching parts 1-2) before seeing part 3 in 2007.  Three times I had seen it and I recall quite enjoying it. But its been ten years and I was easier to please back then.  So I wondered, how would these videogame-to-movie-adaptation films hold up to my criticism now?

Profiteering from bioengineered virus technology (weaponized for the military) while masquerading as a home wares conglomerate whose products can be found in every household, the Umbrella Corporation is an original Proctor and Gambleonly evil.  Or at least one of their scientists was; the one who threw a glass vile of evil virus across the laboratory to volatilize through the vents and corrupt humanity.

Sometime after the incident, we find Alice (Milla Jovavich; The Fifth Element, Faces in the Crowd, Ultraviolet) with amnesia, leaving her memory as bare as her breasts.  Awakening naked in the shower in a lavish mansion, she has no idea who she is or how she got there.  She is taken by force by some sort of black ops team who expect her to remember much more than she does, and then things get interesting.

Theres a nice mix of characters, even if none of them ever develop into anything (except for more zombies, of course).  As Rain, Michelle Rodriguez (Furious 7, Machete Kills) continues her cute tough girl flavor that began with Girlfight (2000) and has persisted 17 years later (Fast & Furious 8).  In that vein, she has sort of a Hicks and Vasquez (Aliens) relationship with a colleague, both part of a larger team infiltrating the Hive and taking Alice along for the ride.  We also find Spence (James Purefoy; The Following, Rome, High-Rise) who, along with Alice, works for the Umbrella Corporation protecting the Hives entrance but now neither of them remember that.

We come to learn that The Hive, a subterranean research megaplex below Raccoon City, has an artificial intelligence: the Red Queen.  Her defense systems whittle down the infiltration team and at least one such scene really stuck with me.  To that end, the effects held up well enough and included some much-appreciated nuance. The CGI was pretty damned good for some parts and very bad for others.  For example, after getting laser-cubed, a soldiers eyeball leaks some white goo before its severed parts fell asunder.  I also liked the zombie dogs, which were less CGI and more live dog covered in goo suits.  On the other hand, certain zombies missing chunks of their face were blaring examples of obsolete CGI technology and the main monster almost looked as it would in the actual videogame complete with 128-bit graphics.  The boss creature was little more than a dumb tongue-lashing monster depicted as a CGI mess. I preferred the dogs and the chop suey lasers over this non-descript beast.

Director and writer Paul W. S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) did justice to the popular videogame with this popular horror-action franchise starter.  The movie may lean on heavy exposition (e.g., the introductory narration)but, hey, so did the game.  A lot of it is videogamified over-the-topand thats okay sometimes.  We have Milla jumping off walls to do jump kicks like Donnie Yen or Carrie-Anne Moss.  But I don't mind at all.

A major shortcoming for me was that the zombie action scenes were all pretty weak.  The bites were lame, the horde was uninspired, and outside of a few zombie kills by Milla, I could have done without them entirely.  It felt like stock footage from The Walking Deadyou know, the kills you don't really care about as the characters kill their way from points A to B.  Although I did enjoy our first meetings with zombies as the team was learning what they were (i.e., not alive).

In the end, a bunch of Umbrella scientists just appear as Alice and our other surviving (but clearly infected) hero escape the Hive.  Back to the exposition, one says: Hes mutating. I want him in the Nemesis programwere re-opening the Hive  Aaaaannnnnd cue the sequel as Alice wakes up again, now in a lab, and stumbles into the Apocalypse!

So there you have it.  Theres nothing particularly thoughtful to be found here, yet still a lot of effort was evident behind making this fun and exciting.  It came as no surprise that it was successful and infected multiple sequels.",4.0
"This movie is a lot of fun.  It takes a classic horror theme, vampires, and brings it up to date, atleast when it came out in 1985.  The use of special effects is done really well, in that they compliement the story, and not try to cover up the fact that the story is weak and full of holes, like in other movies.  This movie is about a guy named Charlie who finds out that a vampire has moved in next door to him, and has started killing people.  The more he tries to convince others of this, the crazier he appears to look.  He tries to enlist the help of a local TV personality, the character played by Roddy McDowall, who hosts his own creep show called 'Fright Night', with little intial success.  Eventually some of the other characters see that Charlie is right, and this leads to the climatic finale.  I think Chris Sarandon plays his role as the vampire realy well, not over the top but right on the money.  He's charming, seductive, and alluring, with a sinister side that only Charlie can see until the vampire exposes himself for what he is....Roddy Mcdowell is great also, playing his role as Peter Vincent, a sort of washed up character actor trying to squeeze as much as he can out of his past celebrity.  A fun movie with a lot of charm and appeal.  I am amazed that this movie came out like 18 years ago....seems like only yesterday...where does the time go?",4.0
"I don't care who you are, you are going to cry during this movie.  Tears of laughter, and definitely tears of sadness; especially at the end.  Bascially about two punks growing up in Salt Lake City, smack dab in the  middle of Mormon headquarters; and dealing with their daily criticism, and  how they see the world.  The movie can actually help you learn a bit about  yourself, anarchy, and how the world relaly works.  Finally, a movie with a  little truth to it.  Matthew Lillard gives his best performance to date in  the flick; and that's no lie!  A must see.",4.0
"I have a list for almost everything. Honestly. And one of those lists is entitled ""My Favorite 80s Horror."" Fright Night holds its own spot in the top ten. Because of its wit, scares, and the little notice of slapstick humour towards old Drac flicks.
 William Ragsdale stars as Charley Brewster, a normal guy who spends some spare time trying to get his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) to put out. Unbeknownst to Charlie, his new next door neighbor is a vampire (Chris Sarandon). As the vampire - Jerry - closes in on his mom, Charley realizes he must stop the vampire at once. But that's not so easy. With the help of Amy, his friend Ed (hilarious Stephen Geoffreys), and creature feature host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), he begins his attempt to rid of the creature of the night.
 Throughout the movies are great horror moments tied in with simple humour. Mostly the dorkyness of being a teenager, and trying to unveil a ""supposed"" vampire. Tom Holland's direction is pretty on, especially the whole alley scene and the showdown between Evil Ed and Peter Vincent. All of the actors put on believable performances. Stephen Geoffreys left behind a classic character in the horror genre.
 If a craving for good old 80s mainstream horror ever hits your system, be sure to pick up or buy (Although a sadly bare bones dvd, plus the trailer) Fright Night. Satisfaction guaranteed.",4.0
"Alfred Hitchcock didn't die of old age  -  he shuffled off this mortal coil because the movies went to the teenagers.  But if he'd lived, and ever delved into the supernatural, he might easily have made this movie.
Average high school kid Charlie has a debonair new neighbor, Mr. Dandridge, who seems to entertain a different knockout girl every night.  Problem is, after they've been to Dandridge's house, the next place they're seen is on the evening news  -  dead.  As if that isn't bad enough, Charlie's seen fangs in Dandridge's smile, and Dandridge only comes out at night.  Who can Charlie get to believe him?  His mother, friends, and the local police think he's seen too many vampire movies.  But Dandridge knows what Charlie's seen.  And he's not about to let him go on talking about it.
This is a great cat-and-mouse thriller, that just happens to be about a vampire instead of a mere serial killer.  The script is clever, the performances good.  Chris Sarandon is charming and menacing, in equal measure, as Dandridge.  Roddy McDowall gets to play cowardly hero as the first person Charlie gets to believe him  -  a late-night horror movie host/has-been actor, who sets out to cure Charlie of his ""delusion"" and instead meets the devil next door.  A pre-Married With Children adorable Amanda Bearse plays Charlie's girlfriend.
The effects are quite good, as are the atmosphere and musical score.  The film's only drawback is that it is sometimes directed with a heavy hand, and spends too much time on the juvenilia of Charlie and his friends  -  though the latter works to good effect, in the sense that it makes them very believable high schoolers, hardly up to facing the menace of an experienced and supernaturally powerful killer.",4.0

"Young Charley Brewster discovers that a murderous vampire has moved in next door, but his mom, his girlfriend Amy, and his kooky friend Evil Ed don't believe him.  To convince Charley that he is in error, Amy and Evil Ed hire the late-night TV horror host, Peter Vincent, to subject the purported vampire to ""the test.""  But once the motley troupe enter the vampire's lair, the FRIGHT NIGHT truly begins.
Despite a predominately youthful cast, this is definitely not the average cookie-cutter teen horror flick.  Writer-Director Tom Holland's boy-who-cried-wolf script is both humorous and scary, and he has ingeniously employed all the typical conventions of the vampire sub-genre in fresh and interesting ways that sidestep the cliche.  This, combined with outstanding special effects and top-notch performances, helps rank FRIGHT NIGHT among the cinematic vampire classics.
The acting is excellent.  The three younger principals-William Ragsdale as Charley, Amanda Bearse as Amy, and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed-all deliver their roles with an honesty few young actors can achieve, and they are therefore quite convincing as teenagers facing a horrific situation.  But it is Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowall that truly carry the film.  As the vampire neighbor Jerry Dandrige, Sarandon is at times flippant and at other times downright terrifying.  He knows just when to play it straight and when to be a ham, and he never misses a beat.  And veteran thespian Roddy McDowall is perfectly cast as ersatz vampire hunter Peter Vincent.  He handles his character's shift from Shakespearean bravado to whimpering cowardice (and back!) so deftly that his performance is nothing less than a sheer joy to watch.
The bulk of the special effects, and therefore the biggest shocks, come during the last third of the film.  But that doesn't mean that the first part of the film isn't scary.  Even in the lighter moments, Writer-Director Holland maintains a spooky atmosphere throughout, and he is helped in this by Sarandon's smarmy vampirish charm and by Ragsdale's convincing depiction of a young man spiraling into the pit of abject fear.
The DVD version of FRIGHT NIGHT doesn't have a lot of extras, but it's still well worth the cost.  To quote the trailer: ""If you love being scared, this could be the night of your life!""",4.0
"Even though it was released back in the 80's, Fright Night remains a classic and bone-chilling vampire movie with riveting action sequences that will leave you breathless.
While this movie does have a certain cheesiness factor to it, that's what makes it so appealing.  If you read the pamphlet that comes along with the DVD, it mentions that the director's purpose for this movie was to mix the Boy That Cried Wolf formula with the classic vampire mythology.
The story itself is very simple.  Charlie, played by William Ragsdale, notices that his new neighbor's aren't quit as normal as they seem.  He begins to see very mysterious happenings involved with them, and when he reports them, nobody seems to believe him.  Soon, the neighbors know that Charlie knows their secret, and Charlie finds himself running to save his own life as well as a few others.
Fright Night has a very talented cast, and it's inch above the the typical vampire movie.",4.0

"This little flick has been one of my guilty pleasures ever since childhood.  It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it does deliver on its promise to scare, titillate, and tickle.

Rather than repeat what many viewers have already said, I'll just give you my favorite scene: Evil Ed, Pencil in the Head.",4.0
"I actually have never seen Fright Night until recently on American Movie Classics and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Although Roddy McDowell looks pretty silly with his hair and eyebrews being covered in white powder he still brings a lot of charm and humor to the film. He has a lot of fun scenes as a Horror film star/vampire slayer. Chris Sarandon (Child's Play) is very good as well as the head vampire. If you liked other modern vampire flicks like The Lost Boys and From Dusk Till Dawn check out Fright Night. It is funny, sexxy and even sometimes pretty damn scary.",4.0
"Poor old Mr. Vincent,could never really come to terms with his treasured little mirror bearing no reflection,to Jerry Dandridge. Peter Vincent's idea of Fright Night,was a cheap,tacky horror show,that had bad ratings,not this. And Charley Brewster,watching too much T.V,started to actually believe that their new neighbor slept in a coffin. And why did Charley's Mother have to go and let Jerry in the house,now he can come around whenever he wants. And why is Jerry always out everyday,and only appears after six p.m,eating an apple? Fright Night maintains an interest throughout,shining through in terms of Direction and Script,and the performance of Roddy McDowall as the local T.V.Stations ""Peter Vincent""-Vampire Killer,who will not believe young Charley Brewster,who begs for Peter's help,to seek out and kill the Vampire next door! Excellent,inevitable,and well staged climax-the look on Peter Vincents face at the end,beaming!-show's every possible,relevant emotion,perfectly. About the transfer:Outstanding,shown at 2.35:1,allowing the full width,and fine details coupled with just the right colour depth,""Fright Night"",to date,Never looked this good. The sound:English/2-Channel Dolby Surround,gives an adequate performance. No real emphasis on not being subtle,but clear,with no background noise,source,or hissing related problems. Overall,in terms of picture quality alone,this DVD emerges a winner. A special Edition of this film,with a 5.1 soundtrack would be cool. 4/5 for this Edition.",4.0
"In the middle of a decade swarming with maniacs chopping their way through  victims came this strong modern vampire tale. Teen-ager Charlie has seen a  coffin being carried in next door and young women have been turnign up  dead. When Charlie begins to believe his neighbor is the real thing, he  calls in late night horror host Peter Vincent in the hopes of stopping the  vampire.  The story was well written, some of the old vampire cliches  are there, but not in the same old way like the crucfix tht does not effect  the vampire because Peter Vincent needed to believe for it to work. The  visuals are great, there is gore, but fortunately it is not overdone. Roddy  McDowell was a great choice as the vampire killer. The few scenes of him as  a movie vampire slayer were a hoot. Chris Sarandon is a very suave vampire,  certainly one of the best vampires in a modern setting. This is certainly  one of the strongest horror films of the 1980's.",4.0

"Being an ex-punk (my punk years were 1978-1983) I didn't expect much from this movie. what a pleasant surprise! Rather than the fashion clones most movies portray, the punks were all individuals, no two the same. Matthew  Lillard was absolutely brilliant. I agree that he is probably one of the  best and most under-rated actors of his generation.
The soundtrack was  HOT too! They included many of the bands that were part of punk's eclectic  mix, including Roxy Music (mother of pearl at that!), all the way through  the Dead Kennedy's.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 was that the  punk scene was portrayed as much more violent than the one I experienced.  Then again, I was in San Francisco at an earlier time - perhaps SLC punks  were more into thrashing.
Even the commentary on the mods was  appropriate! The entire film had much more depth and was much more  thought-provoking than other more ""serious"" films I had recently  watched.  One other caveat - I would have liked to see more women with  short hair. Try this movie - it will surprise you!",4.0
"Beautiful, well directed, well acted, this will be joining my library. However, the story of a privileged rich boy going punk in rebellion against his parents, embracing anarchy to give himself respectable purpose,  discovering that anarchy is as senseless as his rich father's lifestyle,  then in the end, selling out (or buying in) is not a new theme in coming of  age films. Further, Stevo's high self esteem, strong sense of self, and  rich kid background are not, in reality, typical of the SLC Punk scene.
Lillard's performance is stellar and the story catches the effects of  living in a religiously oppressive state gloriously. The acid trip scene in  the park was brilliant.",4.0
"The movie SLC Punk portrays the punk rock lifestyle with more accuracy than any other Punk Rock movie I have had the pleasure of watching. (besides Another State of Mind) If you ask anyone that was once a punk  he/she can tell you similar stories.  Geeks needing a place to belong,  Punks realizing that their rebellion is wasted fighting the system instead  of working to change it, and Parents just trying to understand ... this  movie the entire movement can relate to.
  The movie also boasts a  great soundtrack with the music of Fear, The Stooges, Minor Threat, Suicide  Machines (Although not a band in 1985, when the movie was to have taken  place) Dead Kennedy's and more.
  This is a must see movie for anyone  who was once a punk, or anyone questioning their punk rock lifestyle.  Anyone who may disagree with my current view of punk rock should look at  their blue hair in the mirror, and think if you would hire yourself for a  job.",4.0

"The Zombie survival game series Resident Evil has gripped gamers hearts since 1997 when it first launched on the Playstaion 1. If you are a die hard RE fan prepare to be disappointed in this multimillion dollar popcorn flick's storyline. You aren't going to see your old friends Leon or Jill Valentine. Instead, we get to see Milla Jovovich as Alice, a mysterious reporter woman with some un-ordinary strength and perception. She is accompanied by a SWAT team that dwindles in size over the course of the movie. The group is led by Rain, a tough no nonsense badass chick. Their objective is to enter the Umbrella Corporation's underground testing facility and retrieve a sample of the T-Virus. But little did they know that all the employees that died aren't so dead anymore.

  The virus is a text book zombie contagion, causing death from infection and resurrection of the corpse. The reanimated corpses are classic slow moving, and have an insatiable hunger for living flesh. Some of the zombie scenes are scare you out of your seat good, while others are over done and disappointing. It is a fast paced shoot-em-up after the zombies debut. Ammo is scarce and there is no back up team. Their only choice is to retrieve the anti-virus and escape, or become another drone in the underground swarm of undead.

 Milla Jovovich stars as Alice in this three and a half brain Zombie fest.  Michelle Rodriguez supports with help from James Purefory late of Rome where he played Mark Anthony.  Paul W.S. Anderson directed from his own script.  The R rated film runs for 94 minutes and grossed world wide $102,000,000 on a $33,000,000 budget.

"Superbit DVD, High quality encode that when plays via an Upscaling DVD player, produces quality that matches Blu-ray pound for pound. There are no special features because of the high bit rate used, but from my experience, nobody watches those anyway. Aspect ratio is 1.85:1 aka it fills your widescreen TV.

I abandoned Blu-ray after I found it to be too restrictive of a format. Hardcore DRM that requires firmware updates via Sony servers and limited access to view your disks anywhere you want. Slow loading times and the security risk and less than stellar quality of the players. I now own an upscaling DVD player and have HD TV service, and I'm 100% satisfied as are many others.

Digital downloads like Amazon's service and cheap DVD's and upscaling players have all but killed Blu-ray. Sony is desperate now to the point of manipulating sales numbers and putting ""plants"" on sites like Amazon to try and boost sales. DVD's are outselling Blu-ray 3 to 1 now but Sony has a plan to manipulate those numbers by including the DVD with the Blu-Ray...it counts totally as a Blu-Ray sale and thus manipulates the numbers.",4.0

"I am not going to provide a movie synopsis as there plenty of reviews which summarize this film. Instead this will be an attempt to focus why i like it.
  Out of the movies released to date(five so far with the sixth and final announced), RE: Apocalypse is my favorite. Not only did Writer/Producer Paul W.S. Anderson learn from his successful first installment, but was able to up the ante in a way that worked. In addition to being able to intensify the action from the first movie, I felt he maintained a story line that allowed characters to develop - which is something that has been virtually non-existent in RE: Afterlife and Retribution. With only a couple of exceptions, such as the cemetery scene (How did the T-Virus get to the interned corpses to infect them?), I enjoyed seeing the various responses to the outbreak by the main characters i.e. losing a close friend, being abandoned by your employers, dealing with overwhelming number of the undead and so on. There was more at stake than just a small elite team of soldiers in this film, it was a chance to stop the T-Virus before it infected the global population.
Milla Jovovich establishes herself in a rather elite company of female actresses (Angelina Jolie, Kate Beckinsale and Michelle Yeoh to name a few more) who can pull off the believable action heroine. The supporting cast of Oded Fehr and Sienna Guillory for action with Mike Epps for comic relief worked for me. Thomas Kretschmann did a good job as the Umbrella man put in charge of containing the outbreak that turns people in zombies - yet using the situation as a the prefect test for making sure various top secret projects of the corporation, such as Project ALICE are feasible and potentially profitable.
I admit I prefer the film series to the video games and the animated films so the fact the character Alice is purely invented for the movie does not bother me. I do watch the Extras and Special features on discs, especially deleted/extended scenes. For RE: Apocalypse I thought the extent and subject matter of Special Features was very good, such learning about the idea to give each character their own specific type of firearms so you identify it with him or her and watching how various stunts were designed and executed in the six-part 'Making of' documentary.",4.0

One of the later Resident Evil's was on T.V. And when I figured out there were a couple before I decided I wanted to watch them in order. I found them all except this one the first.

"Resident Evil: Apocalypse manages to be a better action movie than the original.  The movie picks up a few weeks after the end of the first. The action sequences dominate this movie.  'Project' Alice (Milla Jovovich) really breaks out in this sequel.  She awakens stronger by virtue of being injected with the T-virus in the Racoon City Research Center.  We see her being monitored before being released by the conniving Major Cain.  Outside, Project Alice  is confronted with a ravaged Racoon City (seen at the edn of the first movie) and takes up arms.  Alice is now is full at war mode against the zombies and eventually Major Cain and The Umbrella Corporation.  Along the way, she uncovers more lies and betrayal as she wages a war against the evil conglomerate.  There is a side story about the renegade police officer, Jill Valentine and the attempts to rescue Angie Ashford (who has good health thanks to the T-virus injected into her bu her crippled father, Dr. Ashford.  This film provides more background on Alice and the Umbrella Corporation.  There are some good supporting characters in L.J., Carlos, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) & little Alice Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur) (AKA as the voice of the 'Red Queen' (The Umbrella Corporation's supercomputer).  The villains are Major Tom Cain played by Thomas Kretschmann and Dr. Isaacs played with gusto by Iain Glen. The anti-hero, Dr. Ashford (the designer of the 'Red Queen') is played well by Jared Harris. All these characters help the story line and provide more background into the movie.  The battle between Project Alice and Nemesis (an acquaintance of Alice's) is very good. The twist ending is good and tells you there is more afoot.  I enjoyed this action movie with zombies thrown in for good measure. PS, the zombie dobermans are back for another bite.  Overall, this is a very good action/science fiction film with some scary moments.",4.0
"Yes, this movie has technical and script flaws but the action, fear factor and (Alice) Milla Jovovich make that all go away.  This is pure action/science fiction/horror with a capital ""E"" = escapism, excess, evil, and eye-popping.  It is beneath it all an amped-up zombie movie with an evil 'big brother' (The Umbrella Corporation)twist thrown in for good measure.  This film is more horror than the sequels.  This first film in a series sets one up for where this is heading, a futuristic world being manipulated by an evil conglomerate.  The plot is this, someone has released the T-virus in the underground labs of the Umbrella Corporation.  The only none survivors are Alice (Milla Jovovich)and Spence parks (James Purefoy), the 'married' security officers. A special rescue/security team (led by Colin Salmon and Michelle Rodriguez) takes them and a 'police officer'Matt Addison played by Eric Mabius with them into the underground Racoon City complex.  There, they must deal with the super computer, the 'Red Queen; (voiced by Sophie Vavsseur)- the daughter of the computer's inventor and designer, the former complex staff turned zombies by the T-virus , zombie doberman dogs and mutants.  Along the way, they discover betrayal, an eco-advocacy/terrorism plot and corporate greed. In the lead role of Alice, Ms. Jovovich shines as the initially confused and drugged security officer who slowly realizes her role in this tragedy and is able to deal with the evil that exists all around her.  She comes out the hero but is soon at the mercy of the Umbrella Corporation which designates her as ''Project' Alice and the other survivor, Matt Addison as Project 'Nemesis.'",4.0
"I really enjoyed this movie. I've watched it time and time again. I watched the entire series over several days, and it was really fun to watch the story evolve.

"Despite myself, I enjoyed this film. It's got a lot of action, some spooky scenes, some horror. Unfortunately, the special effects have not aged well. They might have been sub-par from the start, but today the wall-crawlers clearly look like old-school video game content embedded into a film--they look so bad it's not even scary. Granted, the film is pretty old now, but this was like 10 years after Jurassic Park, so some criticism is justified.

Add in the bleak scenes at the Airport and the grim scenery of the Turkish prison and you're in the element with Billy Hayes. A real lesson for all. Don't ever consider smuggling anything especially not drugs anywhere. Always respect the laws of the land cause it could change your life forever if you don't.

Yuck. Midnight Express opened a whole new world for me, and I am grateful for that. I especially loved John Hurt and Randy Quaid. I loved Brad Davis in some scenes.

"I've recently sat to watch for the first time all of the resident evil series.  It's no wonder that people love the movies, there's enough suspense, campy undead, action, feminine vulnerability coupled with a kickass attitude for most people who like a movie to entertain them.  As they series progresses, so does the development of Alice's character.  Yet in this first installemnt - I can appreciate the initial concept and the ""coming into oneself"" aspet of who Alice is.

A very fun movie.",4.0
"The author captures all too well the tragedy and lost opportunity that characterized the life of Brad Davis. The subject left a slim body of work as an actor, having wasted his life and died young as a result of substance abuse and self-indulgent hard living. But his (unfulfilled) promise as an artist is clear from what acting he left behind both in movies and in TV. All very sad -- but gripping, nevertheless.",4.0
Great setting; Steve Martin does a great job!,4.0
"Good movie, good actors. Even had a lesson that could be learned. I enjoy this movie.",4.0
"This movie is great.  The acting is good, the plot is intense, and the directing is well-done.  In fact, I would have given it a five- star rating, had I not read the book.

I did this backwards.  I first read Midnight Returns (reviewed on 11-14-12, which is the follow-up book to Midnight Express, which is the story of a man who escapes from the brutality of a Turkish prison.  Having been sufficiently impressed, I bought the original book, and once again I was so moved I purchased the movie.

Unlike the book, the movie is unclear in a lot of places, but most of that is irrelevant, since the basic idea is there-- there is no such thing as human rights and justice in that foreign prison, and every man is at the mercy of the whims of his jailer.  So in that regard, it was engrossing, and  it was nominated for six Academy Awards in 1978, and won for Best Adapted Screenplay.  And that's baffling to me, because it's that very thing that disappointed me.

I understand that movies based on true stories often change some details to make for a smoother presentation, but this one went too far.  My basic gripe was with the ending.  Spoiler Alert:  I'm going to compare the two endings, so further reading of this will ruin any suspense as to the final outcome.  On the other hand,  most readers probably already know that in the end, Billy triumphs and escapes.  That's what made this movie such an inspirational hit several decades ago.  But it's the details of that escape that diverged so far from the truth , it ruined the very heart of the story.

In the movie, there is an accident of Fate, and Billy takes advantage of the situation and waltzes out of the prison in broad daylight.  What a lucky break!  The truth is completely different.  Billy carefully plots, studying various avenues of escape, inspecting places to hide, observing the prison routine, and working his body to build up stamina for the Big Day.  After several years, he then makes his move, hiding in a large container, then swimming quietly to a small dinghy, rowing that boat in terrifying seas, nearly succumbing to total exhaustion.  He finally makes landfall, then moves surreptitiously toward the Greek border, all the while looking frantically over his shoulder, knowing there is an APB on him.  The first part of the book is frightening in that it shows the futility of his situation, but the last few chapters are an edge-of-your-seat thriller  because, in contrast, it offers  that  wonderful thing called Hope.  You know the odds of success are not good, and you know the consequences are horrific if he fails.  Billy does a great job of conveying this terror in his narrative, and I found myself drawn in, hardly daring to breathe, lest his enemies hear me.  What a shame to eliminate this rich and gripping ordeal from the movie.

This change from fact to fantasy  not only robs us, the viewer, but it cheats Billy as well.  His escape was not a stroke of luck;  it was a testament to the courage, patience, endurance and single-minded focus of this heroic man.  In the end, it was  guts and perseverance that set Billy free.

Having said all that, I would still recommend the movie.  It's a good story -but the book is better.",4.0

"Steve Martin playing a moderately ""straight"" character compared to the rest of the foils he's set against.  The sight gag of his ginormous nose is greatest when he's sitting at home with a bird perched on it and muttering the teasing remark that he'd made about it when accosted in the bar.

Splash veteran, Daryl Hannah, plays the romantic lead that is drawn to the moronic eye-candy as Martin plays the Cyrano role to comic delight.",4.0
"I heard from friends about how good this movie is, and it does justice from what i've heard, it's even better than i thought. the reason i give four stars is because i think the picture quality for being 1080p is not as good, i know its a old movie and quality depends on the way it was filmed. this is just my opinion.",4.0
"I just lived a life and a half behind walls. My soul churned away from the body and gasped for matter. I checked my toes when oozing blood split his nails. I screamed and cursed when he found the other end of the tunnel stoned.

Be warned: it will make you feel helpless. And hopeless. You may not like the freedom you enjoy anymore. Or perhaps you will cherish it as a gift: each day, every day.

""Midnight Express"" is not a common tale of heroism and Hollywood stunts. Neither is it about a new age youth that believed more in freedom from responsibility than freedom of the ideals. It starts from a quick adventurous act, but slowly starts to taint your values and respect for humanity. In a way it's a good lesson for those who think the world is their playground just because they were fortunate enough to be born to luxury and vanity.

What starts as apathy for a stupid act soon becomes a battle for human rights and freedom. This movie reminds you that you really cannot get away with any wrong deed. More in some places than others, but you will pay the price. Although in all fairness, Brad Davis was exquisite in his portrayal of the strong will and courage of Billy Hayes (did I mention it is based on a true story?:-).

I rate this move 4.8/5.0. It's pungent. But it's a bomb at that.

To see a picture of the real Billy Hayes, the day he arrived in the U.S. on Oct 24, 1975 via Greece, visit RottenMovieReviews DOT blogspot DOT c o m and search by the movie title. It gives an eerie feeling looking through his eyes, esp after you have just seen the movie.",4.0
I love the video game series. I still remember buying Resident Evil 2 when I was a teenager and taking it home and playing it for the first time.

When I first saw Roxanne if felt it was charming. Problem is ... it hasn't stood up well over time. Many of Steve Martin's scenes look extremely convoluted and rehearsed. The fire chief is really smart and has this big nose ... so he can't find the love of his life. The premise was this new guy that every girl in town thinks is a Greek god can't relate to women and needs someone to tell him what to say. He gets panic attacks if he tries to talk to them. Yet he's able to talk to with no problem with the bar-girl as if all of his problems are totally forgotten. Some of the dialog is extremely silly and not believable. The best scene was when Steve figures out 20 ways of saying someone has a big nose. The fire department was filled with a bunch of seriously screwed up guys that were more of a threat to start a fire than put one out. Still ... I enjoyed watching it ... but it's not Steve Martins' best work.,4.0

"I apologize in advance this isn't really a review of the movie.  I just can't believe how frequently older reviews say alarming things, and I had to speak up.  Things like:

- the ""spoiled"" guy got what he deserved
- that may have been the way things were in the Turkish penal system of the '70s, but we must abide by their ways; ""when in Rome"" as it were
- jokes about the abuse

These types of comments weren't rare, and I found it disturbing.  With so many people out there possessing that attitude, no wonder human rights abuses are allowed to go on in our world.  And will continue until everyone takes the issue seriously and never makes excuses for it.

Also whether or not the story is completely accurate or not, I'm amazed by all the reviewers who declared the whole thing was a complete lie, because ""I've been to Turkey and people weren't like that.""  I've yet to read a review by someone who said, ""I served time in a Turkish prison and it was not like that at all.""  No, these reviewers are people who simply don't like what they they are seeing/hearing, therefore they unequivocally pronounce that everything in the story was a racist fabrication.  Really?  Do you know that for sure???",4.0
"Midnight Express - coming out in '78 - gave us a cinematic view into the Middle East that the three-network evening news at the time didn't provide. The clash of cultures and values in this movie really stood in contrast to the ""malaise"" period in America (as Jimmy Carter put it). The film became more relevant when it was on television a few years later during the Iranian hostage crisis, with the clash of cultures playing out in real life. The idea of hell being a ""Turkish prison"" was popularized with this movie. Also the idea that America's post 60's values had become trivial compared to a world much older than it's just celebrated bicentennial. I think Alan Parker really made his mark with his direction of this movie. I followed many of his later efforts on the strength of this film. It's both brutally real and hallucinatory at the same time. There's a feeling of relief at the end of this movie like no other ""prison escape"" movie. The film is also notable as being one of Oliver Stone's early efforts as a screenwriter. This new dvd effort should improve on the 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, which came out in the ""early authored"" dvd days of 1998. There are few more extras on this edition so it's a worthy upgrade and a definite must have if one is looking for a film that's an insight to the time, the cultures and even some perspective on where we are now.",4.0
"Midnight Express is the 1978 film adaptation to the autobiographical book by Billy Hayes. The book and film tell of Hayes' attempt to smuggle drugs out of Turkey through an airplane flight.

I first saw this film a long time ago in a health class shown to the class as part of a drug lesson. I have always been a big fan of ""Based on true stories films"" so I saw this with an opened mind. I didn't expect it, however, to be this good!

Brad Davis' portrayal of Billy Hayes is one to be remembered. The script is written by Oliver Stone and Alan Parker's directing is excellent. However my only complaint is the fact that the film seems to have a few  differences from the book that are either left out or replaced by something fictional.

I really recommend reading the book as it is an actual account of what happened to Hayes but I recommend also watching the film purely to see great film-making. The book I recommend for those who want to get an actual knowledge of what really happened.

"Saw this a long time ago and it struck me as a 70's liberal film. (it's always easier to be outraged when the oppressor is a one dimensional third world ogre).

The one part of the film I thought was most thought provoking was William

Haye's statement after he found that he had been sentenced to thirty- rather- than 3 years. The arguement went something like this: crime is only a question of the will of the majority- there are no absolute categories of right and wrong. What is and is not criminal changes from time to time based on popular opinion. The people who administer this so called justice are- in classic sixties and seventies finger pointing- no better than pigs.

The implications of this thought are manifold: had Oliver- who I admire-

stumbled on some good acid; is justice, as in the thought of Michel Foucault- a function of historical power forces; should everything, as in DeSade, be permitted. Is there such a thing as ""victiomless crimes?"" And

most importantly, is there any objective standard of right and wrong or,

in a Nietzchean sense, good an evil.

If we apply this logic to the ""detainees at guantanomo bay,"" they seem much less guilty than Billy Hayes. Also why are all the Turks portayed

as weasals, pedarasts, and, generally subhuman. Billy's impassioned plea about the blatant unfairness of his sentence extence cannot erase the stench of half a millenium of eurocentric cultural and political imperialism. For his time (at the time of this film) Jimmy Carter was a

great humanitarian and inspirational leader who was born to early or late to be fully appreciated.

I don't have have an answer but perhaps this may begin productive dialogue

in our increasingly mindless culture. One thing to be sure, Billy Hayes,

in spite of his trangressions, is still representative of the dark side

of cowboy capatilism and the American dream. Nevertheless, his ""postmodern"" arguement of moral relativism is still with us today.",4.0
"""Midnight Express"" is the upsetting true story of an American youth detained at Istanbul Airport trying to smuggle several packets of hashish... This terrific movie based on Hayes' book details the terrible story of his severe experience and final escape...

At the court, Davis' looks were lacking energy and interest... His voice trembled with rage and affliction when he delivered a despairing frantic speech accusing the prosecuting attorney and the judge...

In a prison of desolation, he refuses to accept one captive's advances; he steals an informer's money for revenge; and gives a harsh lesson in brutality on one oppressor...

Paul Smith plays beautifully the brutal and sadistic head-guard... Being of nature cruel and heartless, this bald man is vindictive and indifferent to the truth... He is cruel, vicious, unjust, and verbally abusive...

The Turkish prison is seen as an environment so dirty, horrific and inhuman, clouded by rape, beatings, stress and punishment... Parker permits the cruel prison guards--characterized by their aggressive, cynical, and inflexible behavior--to speak in Turkish since this situation can easily create hopelessness, frustration, hatred and despair...",4.0

"Midnight Express is a brilliant film that reflects an historical moment that those of us of a certain age certainly remember.  The first time I watched it, I sympathized primarily with Billy.

It's a movie - fiction - not a documentary.

All the same - during a recent viewing, I covered my eyes in disbelief at Billy's unbelievably stupid and oblivious smuggling scheme. That's it kid - smuggle hash out of a country in political turmoil whose laws are arbitrarily and brutally enforced by the nation's military police.

How dumb can you be?

In the mid-seventies, not long after Billy's prison escape, I travelled round Turkey where everyone, Turks and Westerners alike, partook of certain substances.  In Istanbul we frequented the infamous Pudding Shop, location of a cop scene in Midnight Express, never once imagining that anyone could, or would, be busted there.  During a five day stay with Turkish farmers, heavily armed soldiers at random MP roadblocks stopped our car four times.

So who's the dumb one?

Midnight Express is a valuable primer on what not to do when travelling that shows the dreadful consequences of breaking laws in a state that lacks the legal safeguards we have (or used to have till W took office), and that I think some Americans too easily take for granted.  I am not passing judgement on Turkey, or on any country - but the reality is that some prison systems are worse than others.  Not much has changed since 1978 in that regard.",4.0
"I randomly picked up a borrowed library copy of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS to test a new DVD player.  I was scarcely thinking about what film was actually in there and when the image of Brad Davis standing anxiously in line at a Turkish airport popped on the screen, I thought, ""Oh, it's Brad Pitt (with a dye job).  Of course, I had seen MIDNIGHT EXPRESS before, so I knew better, but sometimes our subconscious makes interesting connections that our conscious minds never would.

If MIDNIGHT EXPRESS had been filmed in the early 90s, say, rather than the late 70s, it would have been easy to imagine Pitt taking on the role.  Whether he would have been as effective as his namesake, the late Mr Davis, strikes me as doubtful--but certainly possible.  Pitt does go for edgy roles from time to time (e.g. FIGHT CLUB).  But I guess the key difference between the two Brads is that Pitt became a break-out superstar after only a few films, whereas Davis created a bit of a splash with this one and had trouble following this success with anything nearly as memorable. (Well, there was QUERELLE--which is certainly, uh, memorable).

Such is the luck of the draw in Hollywood, as well as elsewhere.  Davis, of course, lived only to age 41 and died as one of the film industry's most notable AIDS casualties.  He did, actually, work steadily until shortly before his death.  But true stardom--assuming he actually sought it--eluded him, despite his talent and appeal.

A role like that of Billy Hayes doesn't come along all that often for a young actor, and certainly didn't any more so thirty years ago.  Relatively few young people of that era actually wound up in a Turkish prison, of course, but Billy's attempt to smuggle a moderate amount of hashhish out of Turkey was reflective of the druggie derring-do of the era.  It was,inessence, the classic crazy youthful stunt, and if Billy had pulled it off, he no doubt would have relished having an exciting foreign adventure tale to tell his friends as they turned on back in the States.  One thing's for sure, he never would have expected a life sentence in a brutal Turkish prison.

Screenwriter Oliver Stone and director Alan Parker evoke the era from the outset by throwing in numerous 60s-type references (the frisbee that baffles airport security; the headlines referring to Janis Joplin's death and Nixon's declaration of war on terror).  It's a very canny cinematic set-up: a naive, playful and play-acting young American falls victim to the ultimate grim ""Establishment"" (a labyrinthine, foreign culture--which is even less inclined to show mercy than the most conservative U.S court would be).

Foreign jail flicks all tend toward the Kafka-esque.  From the first day of his incarceration, Billy attempts to learn the codes and signals that will enable his survival in this proverbial hell on earth.  In an early scene, he is corralled into some kind of mug shot which actually turns out to be a kind of grotesque group shot with his captors.  They're laughing and fooling around at first, and Billy almost instinctively joins in, until one of the guards slaps the silly grin off his face.  Billy has yet to learn the code at that point.  As the perp, he's not allowed to share in the hilarity of the moment.

In time, he does learn to adapt better and begins to cope--until he's within 53 days of his scheduled release date for possession.  A sudden legal reversal, however, shifts his sentence to a full 30 years--for smuggling--and he is thrown into a vortex of despair.  And that's when he explodes.  As does the movie.

I understand that Oliver Stone actually wound up apologizing for the film's supposedly ""anit-Turk"" sentiment.  That's an interesting development.  And a point that can be legitimately debated.  Many years ago, I read the book, and  although I don't recall it all that well, I remember realizing that the film I had seen a few years before was largely-maybe grossly?-fictionalized.  No one expects strict adherence to the facts from a Hollywood dramatization, but of course, when dealing with issues like ethnic bias, the slandering of entire nation, the issue of truthfulness becomes all the murkier.  We all understand screenwriters alter facts, combine personages, and streamline the timeline for dramatic purposes.  We also have little reason to doubt that a Turkish jail (at least a 1970s Turkish jail) may not have indeed been hell on earth  The question is just what circle of hell was it really?

So what do you have at the end of the day,  ""essential truths"" or  ""an ethnic smear campaign""?

Well, at the end of my day, I would have to say that it basically comes down to the ""inner truths"" playing in Billy Hayes' (the MOVIE'S Billy Hayes') own head.  Dramatically, the hatred he develops for Turkey and all things Turkish makes a certain sense.  And his worst utterances are delivered when he is in extremis certainly.  Discerning viewers will realize that it is the character speaking, not necessarily the filmmakers.

When it came out in 1978 MIDNIGHT EXPRESS was recent enough history that many members of its target audience could identify with Billy Hayes.  If you look at customer reviews posted in recent years on Amazon and elsewhere, you may find that many fewer people sympathize with the character today.  That says something about our own times too.  Back in the 60s and 70s,  there was a good deal of ""that-could-have-been-MY-kid"" sentiment.  I don't see that kind of compassion-and that's what it is--as much these days. I kind of miss it.",4.0
This biography is a true story about a young American who gets caught in Turkey (right before he boards the plane to go home) smuggling drugs. The movie moves a bit slow after authorities incarcerate him. Makes me think twice about traveling to third-world countries. Good drama and descent story. BEST screen play I have ever seen. Though there should be a remake of the movie to spiff it up a little more.,4.0
"Billy Hayes went to my high school, a few years ahead of me.  This was an all boys school on Long Island and when he was in jail at that Turkish prison we used to joke that it was better than being stuck in our high school, and also that on the whole the freshman class did more hashish every day than Billy Hayes was able to smuggle across the entire width of his body.  We encouraged to pray for the soul of our fellow schoolmate William Hayes who was languishing in prison, unjustly convicted.  Good looking guy, though not so sublime as Brad Davis, who plays him in the movie.

Billy's girlfriend Susan, who joins him in a half-baked scheme to smuggle moderate quantities of hashish out of Istanbul, is played by the incredible Irene Miracle.  A year or so later she was to come into her element fully as Rose Elliot in Argento's masterful INFERNO, but here she is more subdued, though still ravishingly beautiful.  She and Brad Davis have got to be the hottest couple ever put on film.  Of course their love gets torn apart once the jail portion of the movie begins, around reel 3.  Giorgio Moroder, whose soundtrack is one of the epochal moments of 1970s cinema, wrote a beautiful love theme for Billy and Susan, it is tender and filled with longing and frustration.  Sometimes I hear that theme played even on elevator Muzak and even now it brings back all the sorrow of lovers violently parted from each other, like Nino Rota's theme from the Zeffirelli ROMEO AND JULIET.

Is the movie racist for depicting Turks as menacing, ugly, brutish thugs?  Maybe so.  Maybe that's the lure of the movie, to suck you in telling you this is a true story and thus letting your moral judgments get go off the hook.  The book on which this book is based shows a different angle on the story (in addition, Billy admits to enjoying sex in prison with men, an element that Oliver Stone excised out completely, later making up for it I suppose by including Jared Leto in his movie ALEXANDER), but while watching MIDNIGHT EXPRESS all you experience is fear.  I'm sure that the success of this movie led to the depressing statistic that only 19 per cent of Americans own or use passports.  The rest of us are too terrified of going overseas and being hung upside down naked in chains and flogged by Turks.",4.0

"Midnight Express (1978) is one of those few films I heard a great deal about, but haven't had the opportunity to see...until recently.  Based on a book written by a man who committed a crime in another land, went to trial, was convicted and imprisoned, eventually escaped, and wrote a book about his experiences, a lot of controversy seems to be generated over the whether or not various events in the film actually happened.  Given Hollywood's penchant for changing elements in stories so that they may best come across the screen, I decided, even though the film was based on a true story, to take that with a grain of salt and just watch the film as a film.

Directed by Alan Parker (he was nominated for an academy award for this film), screenplay by the seemingly always controversial Oliver Stone (he won for best adaptation of a screenplay from another medium), the film stars Brad Davis (Chariot's of Fire) as Billy Hayes, the man who escaped and wrote the book the movie was based on...also appearing are John Hurt (he won best supporting actor for his role), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie from the Vacation movies) and Paul Smith (Bluto, from Robin Williams' Popeye movie).

The film begins with Billy Hayes strapping packets of heroin to his body, prior to his leaving the country of Turkey.  Tsk, tsk Billy...possession is one thing, but smuggling?  So very naughty...anyway, due to increased terrorist attacks, all passengers traveling by airplane are searched thoroughly, and Billy gets caught.  No big surprise there...if he hadn't, this would have been a pretty short film.  Imagine getting arrested in a foreign country, one where you don't speak the language.  Pretty scary, I would think.  Anyway, things actually don't appear that bad for Billy, but we know different.  Eventually Billy receives 4 years on a possession charge (the prosecutor was looking for a smuggling charge, which carries a life sentence in Turkey).  Conditions are poor, to say the least, in the prison, as Billy suffers many of the things you'd expect one to suffer being in prison.  Attempts by his family, his lawyer, and American government officials are for naught as Billy serves his time.  Shortly before his time in prison is up, Billy learns that a higher court has ruled that the possession charge he was originally convicted on has been reviewed by a higher court, and they have now decided to charge him with smuggling, increasing his term to 30 years, or, basically a life sentence, given the quality of life in the prison.  At this point Billy explodes in the court as the ruling is handed down, and he reacts badly, understandably so, calling the court and its' members a `bunch of pigs' (probably not the words I would have used, as they certainly won't endear you to your captors, but whatever).  Now a matter of life or death in Billy's mind, he decides he has no choice but to escape.  And try he does...eventually he does, returns home, and decides to write a book about his experience, one that becomes a movie one day, adapted for the screen by Oliver Stone...isn't this where we began?

Now first of all, I have to say, for the life of me, I just couldn't develop any sympathy for the main character.  Let's face it...he was a criminal, got caught, and sent to prison.  Here's a tip for the youngsters out there...if you are planning to commit a crime, especially in a foreign country, it's probably a good idea to research the consequences, specifically how much jail time is involved if you get caught (for instance smuggling drugs in Turkey will get you a life sentence).  The film seemed to spend a lot of time focusing on the brutal and sadistic conditions within the prison, and trying to give the audience justification for Billy's need to escape (that was the way I saw it), but again, he committed a crime, and got caught, so I still found it extremely difficult to feel sad for Billy.  Just because he was an American, he shouldn't be bound by whatever laws exist in the particular country he's in?  I don't think so...I did think Brad Davis did a great job caught up in forces he didn't understand.  I thought John Hurt was good as Max, a perpetually drugged out Englishman in prison with Billy, but I didn't feel he was Academy Award good.  I did think Randy Quaid was really good as another prisoner named Jimmy Booth, a constantly angry man whose entire existence seemed to be based on devising a means to escape from prison (his crime was stealing two candlesticks from mosque, a very serious, and stupid, crime, apparently).  So how much of the story was real and how much of it was exaggerated?  I suppose only Billy knows, but I think there is a clear message here, and it's not that people shouldn't visit Turkey.  No, I the message I got was don't commit crimes in Turkey, or any other country, for that matter.  Having to go to prison sucks, and I am sure the quality of life within these prisons varies greatly, but regardless, if you can't do the time, don't do the crime.  Pure and simple.  Ultimately, as far as prison films go, this is a gripping, sometimes harsh to view yarn, but not the best one I've ever seen.  One of the best, in my opinion, is Papillon (1973), starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, which, oddly enough, is also based on a true story.

Provided on this DVD is both the wide screen and full screen formats.  I've only watched the wide screen format, and while the picture is good, I felt it could have been better, maybe cleaned up a little, giving us a better tone throughout.  Special features include a theatrical trailer and a short featurette with the real Billy Hayes (nice perm, dude) on location of the movie shoot.

"ROXANNE is a marvelous reinpretation of CYRANO DE BERGERAC, and one of Steve Martin's best vehicles. It's witty, funny, comedic and, here and there, thought-provoking. Martin and costar Darryl Hannah, who plays the astronomer and love-interest Roxanne Kowalski, sparkle together. The rest of the cast is letter-perfect. Watch it for the romance, the scenery, the sight-gags, and maybe even the implicit commentary on how physical beauty and attractiveness colors everything that humans do and think. And, if men want to hear one of the most romantic lines of dialog ever, just fast-forward to C.C. Bales balcony speech: ""You see, I am and I will always be the one who loved you without limits."" Wow.",4.0

"I've always had a certain fondness for this movie and yet I've only just watched it beginning to end for the first time. Perhaps it is because this movie is comfort food for the eye. This is a pleasant pleasing romantic comedy. This is also something of a watershed moment for leading star and cowriter Steve Martin. For me Roxanne has always represented the cinematic moment when Steve Martin stopped being the over-the-top ""wild and crazy guy of SNL, and  The Jerk"" and admitted that not only was he intelligent but that he could respect his audience.

I never really thought of the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac as a comedy. I'd always thought of it as a swashbuckling romantic drama along the lines of the Three Musketeers. As a romantic comedy it makes more sense. Having tied Roxanne to the famous Cyrano play I will very quickly cover the bare bones of the plot.

Steve Martin plays small-town Fire Chief C. D. Bales an intelligent, resourceful and brave man with a confidence problem tied to his very large nose. Into his life comes Daryl Hannah playing Roxanne an intelligent astronomy student who promptly falls for the good-looking and vacuous Rick Rossovich playing Chris. CD assumes that Roxanne can never love a man with an outsize nose and therefore he lends his verbal skills to the inordinately shy Chris. This being a  romantic comedy there will be some confusion and some twists but romance will win all.

If there is one subtle complexity this pleasant evening's entertainment it is gal pal Shelley Duval as the not conventionally beautiful Dixie. Dixie is  was friendly and supportive and beloved by none. Love wins over looks just not always. And just in case you think this movie is about subtle complexities there is just enough physical comedy, slapstick and associated silliness to keep you in cheap laughs. Perhaps Steve Martin insisted on these last few easy giggles just in case there was not enough of his clever writing.

This is a movie for quiet relaxing evening. It is the cinematographic equivalent of a very well-made macaroni and cheese side dish - warm a little bit gooey but satisfying.",4.0
"Now we get to the second movie in the Resident Evil movie franchise.  While I would think that doing a second movie would be a little difficult to do knowing that there was 2 stories that occurred in the Mountain City of Raccoon.  There was Leon & Claire that had to survive through the city let alone, Jill Valentine had to go through the city herself.  Although the 3 had their own battles that they had to deal with and knowing how to deal with what would be put in from those games I think had to be a difficult decision.  Though we get some of the characters that we got to know from the games like Jill Valentine, along with a couple of the S.T.A.R.S. Mercenaries, though one of them was written differently for the game.  Not only that we get, my personal favorite baddie, Nemesis put in the movie, and he's just about just like his video game counterpart in Resident Evil 3.  Although the movie does pick up where the first movie left off, yet the Umbrella Corporation tries what they can to contain the virus but can containing it be more than they bargained for?

I like that there's more zombies in this movie than compared to the first movie, though it's in the city this time around so they could be able to pull that off, though at the same time they made the city almost just like in the games.  While the story itself is a little different than that of the games, just like with the first movie and there are things that are in the movie that the fans will be able to recognize as they watch the movie.  After all that, the features that come with this package, it's nice to see what was left out as well as some of the things that went into making the movie, which should be good if you like seeing what done to make the movie possible.  Overall I give 4 stars out of 5.",4.0
"RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE is the second film in what is so far a four-film franchise, and it takes the first movie and ramps it up by several notches. And, cripes, that T-Virus sure is a real mother. The sitch as this sequel opens is this: a zombie plague has scoured Raccoon City, thanks to the ill dealings of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's largest pharmaceutical agency and just possibly the most diabolical global entity, like, ever. Precautions have been taken. Raccoon City has been entirely sealed off, the sun setting on a population left to fend for itself, probably feed on itself. Throughout the city, measures have been taken to ensure the evacuation of Umbrella Corporation's key personnel. The scientist who invented the T-Virus, for one, gets out safely. But his young daughter doesn't. At sunrise, Raccoon City is scheduled for a tactical nuclear strike. Some really heavy sunscreen is recommended.

The story tracks a tiny band of survivors as they try to stay alive long enough to escape the city limits. It helps that this group is made up primarily of highly skilled operatives from the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) unit and also from an Umbrella strike force. It also helps that the scientist who invented the T-virus is willing to guide them to safety, provided they rescue his young child. The odds for survival increase dramatically with the arrival of Alice, former head of security for an underground Umbrella complex. But it's a slightly different Alice than from what we remember in the first movie. She's been experimented on by the Umbrella think tank and she now demonstrates super powers. Another survivor from the first movie figures in APOCALYPSE, except that he'd been tweaked and probed and genetically engineered into becoming the terrifying Nemesis program. And no surprise that even with a city apocalypse going down, there are still fiendish Umbrella asshats bent on pursuing their messed-up experiments - such as pitting the Nemesis Program and Alice against each other, in a backstreet brawl, just to see who'd come out on top.

Plot, sphlot. This is survival horror cinema, so one shouldn't expect too much verisimilitude or texture. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE was designed with crunching zombie kills and gory special effects in mind. Sexy Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr step into the fray as two uber-capable action heroes in their own right. But Milla Jovovich owns this franchise, and she again lends her fantastic looks and her palpable physicality. Milla is fearless when it comes to committing to her action sequences, and she performs a lot of her own stunts, including rappelling 60 feet down the side of a high rise edifice. She really anchors the film, drives most of the spectacular action set pieces.

Plenty of gamers complained that the first film strayed too far from the video game, and here's APOCALYPSE attempting to atone. Consequently, game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory), Carlos Olivera (Fehr), and Nicholai Ginovaef are introduced, and the hulking Nemesis program is the featured Big Bad. The character of Alice was, of course, originally invented for the film franchise. The lickers are back, as are the gore hounds. Plenty for our good guys to shoot to bits. And, as ever, no dearth of the shambling undead, including a pack of flesh-eating school children.

Mike Epps provides the comedy relief, but you should watch the movie anyway.

What I have is the 2-DVD Special Edition with tons of bonus material. Disc one has the feature presentation with the option to view it in either wide or full screen and three audio commentary tracks (including one with actors Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Milla Jovovich and Milla's unfortunate cackling - and they sure make fun of Germans a lot). Disc 2 has: 20 forgettable deleted scenes, 12 minutes worth; cast outtakes; ""Game Over: RESIDENT EVIL Reanimated"" - a six-part ""Making Of"" the film (focusing respectively on the stunts, the zombie choreography (the Undead Boot Camp), the sets, the weapons used, and the visual f/x); ""Game Babes"" explores the emergence of female action stars in cinema, showcasing Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory; ""Corporate Malfeasance"" is a featurette focusing on how the Umbrella Corporation bears real world similarities; ""Symphony of Evil"" is  a special effects montage; ""Poster Gallery"" showcases five submissions from the finalists of the online poster design contest; and there are movie trailers, including the theatrical trailer and teaser for RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE and the trailer for RESIDENT EVIL.",4.0
"Many reviewers ridicule the method used to try and smuggle the drugs in this movie, but back in the early 1970's (when the film was based) these kind of methods actually took place.  Yes, people are stupid for doing these things ... but it's hard not to have compassion for them when they are served lifetime sentences.
""Midnight Express"" explores one man's time in a hellish Turkish prison.  The tension of being caught and then beaten in prison are so well captured that you almost don't want to look.  One scene that comes to mind is when Davis is hung upside down and beaten so bad, you can almost feel it.
Davis performance is exceptional, yet did not give him the career you'd expect.  An excellent actor, who died at the age of 41.
The DVD itself is excellent too.  An impressive widescreen transfer, plus a full screen option thrown in for people who don't know the value of widescreen (ie. a pointless inclusion in my opinion).  The DVD also boasts a 1978 documentary of the film, and a trailer.

"After watching this movie a few times, I finally read the book and came to realize the movie is indeed only a partial recollection. The only really bad things that happened to Billy Hayes when he was in prison in Turkey were the incident where he slugged a trustee for self-defense after stealing a blanket and a couple guards practicing their strokes on the soles of his feet. The real Billy also did not call the Turks pigs and instead apologized for his mistake. By the end of the book, he was scheduled to be released in 1978, but escaped from an island in the Aegan sea on a dinghy, not impalling the head guards' head on a hook. From what I heard from Turks who saw this movie, the Turkish characters spoke an incomprehensible gibberish, but also most of the actors playing Turks were Italian, and in one case, the head guard was an American who just happened to play Bluto in the Robin Williams version of Popeye. One thing about the movie I don't quite understand: Who in the world was the American (Bo Hopkins) that takes Billy Hayes into his custody to hunt down the drug dealer, and then has him arrested after he attempts to elude the police, then he and the detectives in the case are not even in court during Hayes' trial? Any answers would be helpful",4.0
"The only word I can think of to accurately describe this film. Midnight Express at its' core is an expose not of the Turkish prison system but of the brutality that man is capable of. Based on true events, Midnight Express follows the life of American Billy Hayes, who is caught trying to smuggle a small amount of hashish on to his plane. Needless to say he is caught and sentenced to serve time in a Turkish prison. Billy endures endless torture both physical and mental during his tenure in the prison. There is one particularly beastly guard who looks like James Gandolfini from the Sopranos; anyway this guard loves to whoop up on the prisoners, especially the Americans. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions with plenty of twists and turns. The film score is nothing short of haunting. The use of sound and music in this film add a whole other level of horror to an already hellish situation. Some film buffs might also notice Randy Quaid in one of his earliest film roles as another American imprisoned with Billy. Overall, Midnight Express left me with a sick feeling. It challenges the viewer to endure countless acts of violence and brutality and yet still believe in the strength of the human spirit. A must own for any serious DVD collector.

"alright I'm Turkish. Just about a week ago I was questioned by a cab driver in washington dc based on his knowledge about Turkey-which was nothing but midnight express. I was disturbed and totally disgusted with his ignorance. How could a man in his sane mind could make judgements based on hollywood productions?
The Turkish hate this movie with a passion.any other viewers here should try to understand that Turkey is a developng country trying very hard to advertise itself and try to shed off the barbaric image the ottoman empire left it with.a movie like  the midnight express could evoke a lot of prejudice and hatred against Turkey -especially for those who could not even tell f Turkey was a bird or a country.
Leaving my patriotic emotions aside,As an artist I have to be totally impartial. It was well done. The acting was superb, soundtrack above the standards for it's time and the plot,totally striking.
Just remember,this is not a documentary,its an artistic interpretation of someone who has never been to the Tukish Jail at the time of the event-neither have I. I congradulate Parker  for his directing talents but totally hate him for his ignorance in research and his movie's possible effects on a newborn nation.",4.0
"Why Brad Davis did not receive an Oscar nomination, I can't understand.  Well, he DID kiss another man and even though Hollywood is filled with homosexuals, the industry is very homophobic.  What a shame.  This was a glorious performance.  Likewise, Davis' bravery in the realm of homosex in ""Querelle"" was also ignored by the Oscars.  In that film, he went ""all out"" having sex with men and tongue-kissing to boot!
Great acting in ""Boys in the Band"" was completely ignored in 1972 by the Academy, so I shouldn't be surprised at this particular snub. Women and homosex is excused, of course.
I recommend this film mainly because it warns people, who might break laws in other countries, NOT to take a chance.  Once you are stuck in a foreign prison, your country might not be sympathetic towards you, an American lawbreaker and embarrassment (remember, they have better things to do).
Americans have this notion that they are ""special"".  We have a warped idea of what it is being American.  People in other countries are NOT impressed by us.  We are considered the most racist country on the planet and we are embarrassed by our toothless racists that expose themselves to the world in the media.

You'll enjoy the scenes where he cleans the clocks of stupid men picking on his oversized nose - he does it with total style and humor. And the 20 insults (against his nose) that he comes up with himself are pretty funny.

A cute adaptation of Shakesphere's famous Cyrano - although the nitwits who make up the fire department in this little town are just a little TOO stupid for my tastes.

But this was indeed overall a charming and enjoyable movie.",4.0
"Merhaba I am Turkish and I very displeased at this film. I work at Turkish jail and it nothing like in film, we all very nice, there was this guy arrested for being Kurdish, and I break one leg for fun, and then he say, oh please don't break the other one, so I didn't. This is just more propaganda by trouble-making Armenians, they say there was Armenian holocaust, but all those Armenians don't know what they talking about, those 1.5 million people just got lost and the men no ask for directions thats why they disappeared.",4.0
"Reading some of these previous reviews is quite interesting in that in some of the critiques there is so much speculation as to what really happened to Billy Hayes in Turkey and what's a product of the Hollywood movie/money making machine. I've even read other reviews where some viewers are debating with others about foreign prisoner policies or lack of,etc.,etc. Only the real Billy Hayes knows how much info he has told the public. Some critics see his time spent in Turkey prison as a period of martyrdom. While others just remember his act that got him there in the first place as moronic. All I want to do is review this movie based on,well, the movie itself...No political debates, questions, agendas or issues here.
The movie was very suspenseful right from the get go. Giorgio Moroder's musical score,while such synthesizer work seems so outdated by today's standards now,adds to the intensity;eerie electronic effects,etc. Who can forget the famous Chase theme. The late Brad Davis was perfectly cast. You see his fine acting in the film as he transforms from a wide-eyed and naive, yet intelligent(or not so) American in a foreign land into a  violent, maniacal,and broken down prisoner who reaches subhuman level.  In fact, it's astonishing how another actor 20 some years later strongly resembles him in almost every way;Brad Pitt. Minus the fact one had black hair, the other is blonde. It would be incredible to see Midnight Express re-made with Pitt in the lead role...Randy Quaid was also memorable as the hyper and tempestuous cell mate planning the first escape. John Hurt's character serves as the voice of reason which is a contracdiction since he's mostly stoned throughout the film and in the same prison for his own crime. The cinematography is foreign (pun intended), gritty, grimy and has plenty of shady/sleazy characters from the consolate(actor Bo Hopkins),lawyers, and court system to the other inmates. The prison warden is nothing more than probably a criminal himself and fits every bit the stereotypical prison villain one can expect in a film who abuses his authority and relishes releasing his own personal brand of hell upon the inmates...The ending of the film is something else. Just as I felt the nervous intensity from the beginning, I felt it in my gut at the end !
Again, if the powers that be and Hollywood's listening,re-make this film with Brad Pitt and see what we get. Probably shadings of other characters he's played from the lunatic in 12 Monkeys to what we see now in his latest film The Mexican and other various films...Give me credit for the idea if it get's done (yeah, right).",4.0
"It's good with enough action, but I think they went a little overboard with the superpowers. But the additional cast who portray good guys does give it more fun to watch.",4.0
"I recently viewed all of the ""Resident Evil"" films for the first time... Dare I say, I'm very impressed! This particular film had a lot going for it. Milla Jovovich is absolutely stunning as the amnesiac heroine, Marco Beltrami's post modern underscore hits the nail on the head and Paul Anderson's vision of a world overtaken by Zombies is flat intriguing. The entertainment value of this film is through the roof (thanks in no small part to the amazingly emotional connection the viewer creates with Alice,) and the scripting is really pretty impressive!

So, why the four stars instead of five? I hate to say this... Special effects. The special effects in this film occasionally take away from the much needed tension (especially the fight towards the end of the film...) It's odd that they chose to CG the monsters in that manner, because it really looked quite dated. Aside from this, fans of the ""Resident Evil"" game franchise will definitely like ""Apocalypse"" best (for all of it's one liners and slo-mo action scenes, it captured the spirit of Racoon City in a way neither of the other films did.)

All said, though, this is a really great way to get your sci-fi/Resident Evil fix. (The opening sequences are filmed to delicious perfection with a thick coating of tension, a dusting of old school ""Alien"" and an undercurrent of flat out horror.)",4.0
"In 1987, the romantic comedy film ""ROXANNE"" starring Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah, a modern retelling of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", was a film that received critical acclaim and has been regarded as one of the Steve Martin's best work as an actor and screenwriter.

The film was directed by Fred Schepisi (""Six Degrees of Separation"", ""Mr. Baseball"", ""Iceman"", ""The Devil's Playground"", etc.)

""ROXANNE"" is an entertaining romantic comedy with Steve Martin in the top of his game.

Featuring clever writing, wonderful acting and Steve Martin carrying this film to incredible heights through a perfect blend of romance and comedy.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

To see ""ROXANNE"" in high-definition was actually quite nice.  The location in the Pacific Northwest shows us the mountain regions surrounding the area, sunshine, blue waters.  Now in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1, the film really does bring out the outdoor scenes and for an late 1980's film, the picture quality is actually pretty good.

The film does show its age because of the fashion (Daryl Hanna's leather boots and Fred Willard's Miami Vice fashion is so easily identifiable with the 80's) and musical styles presented and there are times that the film looks soft but for the most part, picture quality is clean.,

For a film that is over 20-years-old, you really can't go wrong with this Blu-ray release because currently,  it is the best looking transfer that you will ever find of the film.

As for audio, ""ROXANNE"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (English, French and Portuguese) and a Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital track.  The film is dialogue heavy and thus a lot of the film is front channel-based and there are no use for special effects or rear channels for this film, so expect to see mostly your front and center channels being utilized.  Audio is clear and well-understood and the scenes that showcase classical music was delightful to hear as well.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Unfortunately, there are no special features included. The Blu-ray disc for ""ROXANNE"" is BD LIVE enabled.

JUDGMENT CALL:

It has been well over 20 years since I first saw ""ROXANNE"" on cable and for the most part, watching the film again, I can say that it does hold up quite well nearly 23 years later.

Steve Martin was absolutely fabulous in this film and his role as an executive producer, main actor and screenplay writer must have been quite interesting because he manages to seamlessly make this film seem smooth.  How he took the storyline of ""Cyrano De Bergerac"" and wrote his interpretations for his character was a bit humorous and entertaining.

But when it comes to Steve Martin, it's all about delivery.  Martin owned this role.

There is one scene where he is encountered by a man at the bar who wants to fight him but after losing a bet in darts, Martin's character C.D. has to come up with 20 unique nose jokes.  Martin flawlessly pulls off over two dozen and you can tell by the talent watching him at the bar as they all watch him showcase his acting style, his quick wit but smooth delivery of his lines, they were impressed.

Of course, watching Daryl Hannah in her 80's clothing and hairstyle definitely made this film feel ""80's"" but thankfully for the High Definition transfer, watching ""ROXANNE"" in 1080p High Definition was quite nice.  Seeing her blue eyes and beautiful smile definitely made her one of the popular actresses of the 1980's and both she and Martin, both look incredible now as they were 23 years ago.

And of course, the film also features a good number of talent such as the popular Shelley Duvall,  ""Top Gun"" actor Rick Rossovich, Fred Willard, John Kapelos and emerging stars Damon Wayans and Kevin Nealon.

With a lot of positive to say about the film, the negative would be the lack of any bonus features.  Granted, this film is an older film but it would have been nice to see Steve Martin, Daryl Hannah or even director Fred Schepisi make some sort of comment.

And for a comedy film, there has to be a gag reel or something that could have been thrown in.  Not even the theatrical trailer was included and that is my only problem with this release.. the lack of any special features but the trailers for other films.

Overall, you can't fault the film because it's an entertaining romantic comedy that continues to stand the test of time and now it's available on Blu-ray ala High Def.  If you are a Steve Martin fan, ""ROXANNE"" is a film that deserves to be in your collection.  It's one of his best films (next to my favorite feat. Steve Martin, 1991's `L.A. Story') and definitely a film worth checking out!",4.0
"Midnight Express is the true story of Billy Hayes who is thrown into a turkish prison for trying to smuggle hash out of the country. During the five years he spends in the prison,he suffers emotional,physical and mental torment. The prison is run by a brutal guard played by Paul Smith who seems to have a good time beating the prisoners which makes him a symbol of cruelty. Among with Brad Davis' great performance as Billy Hayes is John Hurt and Randy Quaid who both deliver really great performances as well. Brad Davis I think was overlooked by the academy which surprised me because he displayed his character with so much emotion that you had to feel sorry not just for his character but also for him. Midnight Express is the kind of prison film that makes other prison films too hard to compare. The Shawshank Redemption was also a film I enjoyed but wasn't as gut wrenching or emotional as this film. Midnight Express is in my opinion a film that is too horrifying to ignore which means that this film  should not be ignored. It shouldn't be watched for entertainment value. That isn't why this film was made. Midnight Express I highly recommend.",4.0
"Midnight express is (by any standard) spectacular. A ""must see"", which grabs your attention from the very first minute, with its extraordinary sense of realism, and a good DVD image quality (dubble sided  disc, for two aspect ratio's. Nice idea) But what made this movie so well  known even amongs those who never got around to see it, is its famous, and  highly original sound track, made very succesfull issue as LP (and the  later CD). That is where the DVD dissapoints. Hard to accept, but all we  get out of the speakers, is a strait Mono track, in a movie which offers  one of the best in music originality.",4.0
"This was my first time seeing the movie, and I didn't read the book, although now I plan to. I found the movie fascinating and also difficult to watch for long periods. I had to leave the room a few times for several  minutes before I resumed watching. I don't think I'd want to go through the  horror and gut-wrenching experience of seeing it again, but I'm glad I did  at least once. It was unlike anything I'd ever watched.
The reviews that  dismissed the movie simply because they believe it casts a bad light on  Turkey are missing the point. Is the tale true or not? It's nearly  impossible to refute anyone's personal experience unless you've gone  through the same thing. By the way, I was in Istanbul and other parts of  Turkey last year as a tourist, and while the country is the most physically  stunning I've ever seen and the  individual Turks I met were kind, I didn't  care for the culture and I can remember thinking I wouldn't want to be on  the wrong side of authorities there.",4.0
"Steve Martin is C.D. Bales, a perfect catch for any woman except for one drawback. He has a huge nose. Everyone is hypnotized by it. No one can ignore it. The movie is a take-off on the play, Cyrano de Bergerac. C.D. works for the fire department and falls for Roxanne, an astronomy student. Because of his nose, he courts her through a friend. Romance and humor intertwine. The scene in which Martin enumerates insults about his nose is brilliant.",4.0
"I loved this movie when I was younger. It's still magical, but for whatever reason, it isn't the five star film I remembered.  That's alright because it's still a good date movie if you want to stay home.  My one big quibble is that the special feature section is so minimal.  The studios should really go back and give these classic old movies the proper treatment they deserve.",4.0
"It wasn't a perfect movie, but I cant understand the relentless bashing of it either. I thought it followed the plotlines (and characters/monsters) of the game a lot closer than the first (which I think was a good thing). Maybe I'm just an unashamed fan of the VG, but I thought this was the better effort of the series. It is what it is...a fairly cinematographic, fast paced popcorn movie.",4.0
"Steve Martin earned & deserved an Academy Award for ""Roxanne"", but Hollywood doesn't give Oscar to Comedians.  At least he got nominated for a Glob(e).  One of the great things about this movie is that there is no ""bad guy"" - you don't have to root for someone to go down in order for the hero to prevail.

The score is a tad dated.  It would be great if it could someday be redone.. the same music, different instruments.  Ditch the cheesy 1980's synthesizer and sax.  Steve Martin is a tremendous bluegrass fan:  How about the same music, played on bluegrass instruments?",4.0
Cyrano is the classic chick-plot of all time.  And nobody could retell it like it is retold here.  The sexual inuendo in places cost this one a star in my rating but otherwise this is a wonderful romantic comedy with a wonderful retelling of an age-old classic tale.,4.0
"Finally got around to seeing this and was very impressed.  The story is compelling, the performances are excellent, and the score is haunting, but ultimately it is Stone's tight, effective screenplay that makes this movie  work so well.  No, it does not give a very favorable impression of the  Turkish people, but given the circumstances of the prisons there at this  time, it is probably realistic.  The ""pigs"" courtroom speech is  absolutely true to how Hayes would have felt at that point.  A perceptive  viewer would understand the context of his speech and assume that in  reality not all Turks are pigs.  Context is everything.  Ultimately,  though, that doesn't have much to do with the point of the movie.  It  documents in painstaking detail the brutality and the suffering this young  man went through.",4.0
"Didn't anybody else find Hannah's performance here to be...lacking?  She just doesn't make it.  The last scene, in which her character declares her love for Martin's character, is almost unbearable for me to watch, she's so lame and unbelievable.  Despite her physical beauty, I can't accept that Martin's character would fall for her.  He's so full of life and she doesn't show near enough character to match him.  I don't think she's a good actress.

Sorry, Daryl.",4.0
"Resident Evil: DVD Review

Grade: B-

O.K.--I'll admit it. I stayed away from everything Resident Evil for a while, passing them off as lame movies, unnecessary books, and lack-luster video games. I really don't know what motivated me; it was just something I never bothered with. Boy, was I wrong. Although the first live action film--this one--definitely has it's problems, I am now what you could call, or as close as a living person could get to obsessed with the RE universe.

(Oh, and I'm patiently waiting for the Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles....)

Now back to the movie--yep, you heard me, it has its flaws. Alice is the head of security at a top-secret base miles underground called ""the Hive"", a secret, high-tech facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation. The scientists there specialize in bioengineering and viral weaponry; and one morning their T-Virus, a virus which revitalizes dead cells and has it's side effects, is unleashed on the unsuspecting workers there. Now a team of highly elite trained officers must infiltrate the Hive and find out what went on down there. They stumble upon Alice who can't recall who is she and what she is doing there; they bring her along anyway. They open the Hive, and almost immediately stumble upon the dangers in there...Did I mention the ""side effects"" that may occur are A: death, B: waking up again after dying, due to the virus revitalizing dead cells--there for reviving you, and C: after you wake up, you want to eat something, namely, people. And that means that our people down in the Hive are in serious trouble.

Now of course the actors play it cool, going through the clichd motions, and getting picked off one by one. Milla Jovovich, soon to be seen in A Perfect Getaway, is sort of bland is this movie (although she gets into the grove of her role in Apocalypse and Extinction, giving excellent performances), and doesn't really do much. (Well, aside from doing the Matrix on some wickedly awesome zombie dogs.) Michelle Rodriguez on the other hand seems to always have a dirty look on her face; when she's not shooting zombies, she's busy pouting. All the other actors that had potential die to early in the movie...

That brings us to the special effects: surprisingly varied, they range from awesome (the zombie dogs, which are a mixture of CGI and make-up, are realistic and ferocious), to mediocre--the Licker, a monster that terrorizes the group towards the end of the movie, looks straight out of the video-game, graphics wise. I would say they could have done way better, but the special effects group started work on the Licker late, therefore it wasn't exactly up to par. (They solved this problem in Apocalypse though; they started working on the Lickers during pre-production.) As for the zombies--they have a ton of detail, and it looks like they seriously put some time into them.  After sending the actors to a ""zombie boot camp"", they intricately placed their details, creating effective and creepy zombies.  Bravo to the special effects team on that--you need it after that horrible Licker.

Now I'll also admit--I was going to give this an even lower grade, but decided the positives-negatives canceled each other out. The positive? I loved the ending. Although it too obviously sets up for a sequel, I just loved it. It has a desolate, creepy feel to it, and it kind of assured me that the sequel would be better. The negative? The editor should have been fired. It almost seems as if whole scenes are left out; therefore the movie at times gets highly confusing. For example: Alice and Matt--an environmentalist who befriends Alice--are talking in a room. The next moment they are running from a horde of zombies! How did THAT happen? After examples like this happen at least three times throughout the movie, I got fed up. They should be happy they made the ending so good...

So, in the end, is Resident Evil really the best effort they could have given? The answer is no, but it still has its fun moments. Whether it's seeing the zombie dogs, getting scared by a random loud noise, or seeing elevators kill people in particularly gruesome ways, Resident Evil still packs a (mild) punch.",4.0
"Those evil, all powerful corporations just never learn.  Rule #1:  never, never go back into the secret, underground research facility after it has been sealed off because of cannibalistic zombies, rampant viruses, and a crazed, out of control, killer computer.  But in RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, the big, bad Umbrella Corporation does just that.  And baaaaad things are released into Raccoon City.  Very bad things.  And it looks like only Alice can stop them.

As with the original Resident Evil, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a monster-mashing, gore-filled zombie flick which is unexpectedly entertaining.  The pace is fast, the plot is thin, but followable (and even contains a few surprises), and the acting is typical for a monster movie...but then again, you don't watch monster movies for the acting.  The special effects are decent, if corny at times.

If you take this flick for what it is, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a fun, modern day B-movie, perfect for a popcorn evening at home.  My husband and I had as surprisingly good time with this.  And we are actually looking forward to seeing the next one!",4.0
"I really wasn't expecting myself to enjoy this movie as much as I did. It was a nice popcorn flick with good action. I found it to be quite entertaining.

I am usually very critical when it comes to movies. My views on movies usually parallels many critics but I found myself thoroughly engaged while watching this.

The first Resident Evil movie surprised me because I was mildy entertained by it but I did not enjoy it nearly as much as this one. Of course if you're expecting an Oscar-worthy blockbuster here you will be disappointed but if you just want some good ol' mindless movie-watching fun, I recommend Resident Evil: Apocolypse. The producers seem as if they really put some effort into making this movie an enjoyable experience and not out for the fast buck. Matter-of-fact, I really wouldn't mind owning this movie.",4.0

"__________________
This is such a good movie. Like other screenplays Steve Martin has written, it's based on a classic piece of literature. The scene (about 30 minutes in) where Martin's character comes up with 20 different jokes about his nose actually has more than 20 (count 'em), which is something we no-lifes notice while watching.
Daryl Hannah -- sweet, gorgeous, tall, talented, unemployed? That's a shame. Her performance in this movie is the best of any of hers that I've seen. A few years later she had a cameo in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" -- a truly great movie -- in which, alas, she had to play a stereotypical dumb blonde actress.
There are so many laughs, and so much sensitivity, that I'm not surprised at all that ""Roxanne"" is my sister's favorite Steve Martin movie. I love ""L.A. Story"", but have to give a slight edge to ""Roxanne"".",4.0
"Ravenous zombies - what more could you ask for on Halloween?  RESIDENT EVIL is chock full of monsters, blood, gore, and actually cool, creative decapitations.  Based on a popular computer game (which I have never played), RESIDENT EVIL is an entertaining monster flick for a cozy evening at home.

RESIDENT EVIL opens with a bang:  something has gone seriously wrong in a secret, underground research facility.  (Isn't that always the case?)  Red Queen, the computer that runs the complex, has gone mad, killing everyone in the place, and initiating a complete lock-down of the facility.  The only people on the outside who might know what is going on have no memory.  A crack military team is sent in to determine what happened.  But things go horribly wrong...

As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun.  It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath.  The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers.  The plot is pretty loose and full of holes, but I really didn't care; I was having too much fun.  The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.

If you enjoy this sort of thing, you will really like RESIDENT EVIL.  My husband and I did, and it was just the thing for Halloween.  But seriously, couldn't the Umbrella Corporation, who owns the research facility, see this coming?  I mean, they named their master computer Red Queen.  It was in the cards.

"This second in the trilogy is good, but as many of my friends warned me, not as good as the first.  You have the zombies, demon dogs, etc. as well as a monster who has 'very familiar eyes', but it seems a little dark and shadowy, which seems to rob it of some intensity. It feels more spooky than action packed. Perhaps because they're still stuck in the city fighting in and out of the buildings it just seems too cramped, and too much like the first. I did like it though and it's good enough to stand on its own without watching the first in the series.

"This isn't an in-depth review of the movie, just a review of the Blu-Ray transfer.  You either like zombie movies, or you don't.  If you don't, don't bother with this one.  If you do, I recommend this.  Anyhow, what I'm concerned with here is the video quality and, to a lesser extent, the audio quality.  Both are excellent; however, I'm irritated by Sony's stubborn use of MPEG-2 transcoding rather than Microsoft's VC-1.  Both Sony Blu-Ray's that I own (Casino Royale and RE: Apocalypse) use MPEG-2 compression; so, I assume that Sony just doesn't want anything to do with Microsoft (See: HD format war).

Honestly, the DVD transfer of this film is top notch for that medium; so, unless you don't own RE: Apocalypse, I wouldn't recommend snagging this one unless you just HAVE to have it in 1080p.  The DVD version on my Oppo looks excellent.  But if you can find it cheap on Amazon, you won't be disappointed.",4.0

Our favorite genetically enhanced female weapon (courtesy of the Umbrella corporation) has been selected to face off against another type of genetically altered human weapon to see which type would serve best for the Umbrella weapons division and military application. But the fun doesn't stop there. They also threw in a hundred thousand Zombies running around the now infected Raccoon City! What more could one ask for? Oh, and our small rag tag group of humans have to somehow escape the now locked down city before dawn before the place gets sanitized by a nuke. Enough pressure for one movie? Oh Ya! I'd buy that for a dollar!

"A film that people like or dislke, I found this movie very entertaining dispite some flaws-production/storyline- that has been pointed out by prior reviews. The blu ray transfer was more than adequete. And, unlike many blu ray releases has all the extras that were included in the 2 disc standard version.",4.0
"In the past I was never one to get my hopes up about a video game made into a movie...this series pleasantly surprised me(sans the latest one Extinction which left much to be desired) But Apocalypse had great pacing, great nonstop action, a little bit of everything for an action/horror style movie. Mila is great as always. I love Bluray, so crisp, and sharp, pounding audio, love it on my samsung lcd hdtv and surround sound home theatre system.",4.0
"After Sony and Capcom rejected zombie genre director George A. Romero's script in 1999, Director Paul W.S. Anderson was selected to take over the reigns of the Resident Evil production which was somewhat inspired by its video game counterpart as well as the Disney fairytale, Alice in Wonderland.

Overall, Resident Evil was an entertaining movie from start to finish as it had a little bit of everything, including a foundation for a sequel (which turned out to be 2004's Resident Evil Apocalypse).  I especially liked the scene transition using a digital schematic of the Umbrella Corporation's research facility known as the ""The Hive.""

Check it out!  But if you are a diehard Resident Evil videogame player, you will need to divest yourself first of Resident Evil cannon in order truly enjoy its cinematic interpretation which clearly stands on its own.",4.0
"This was my first time watching a blu-ray movie and although I saw a difference right away in clarity and color, I thought to myself it wasn't THAT much of a difference, that is until I saw the standard definition clips in the bonus section.

While the difference is not as HUGE if you're using an upconverting DVD player, it is different nonetheless and is noticeable. No type of technology will smooth a scene (or movie) meant to be dark and grainy by design, so I won't hold it against Blu-ray (or any HD format) yet. I'm waiting for another 6 Blu-ray movies to arrive and will update this review once I get to see them.

As far as the movie itself, I mean, it's a videogame based movie, so don't expect ""Gone with the wind"" plot and depth. It's an action movie for the sake of action with a cast that is not known for their acting (with a few exceptions). If you're a fan of the videogame, it's great to see the characters show up in the movie and I also liked the continuity from the previous movie. You get to learn some more of what happened in-between. If that seems like an obvious trait for a movie to have, you're not too familiar with movies based on videogames [laughs]...

Overall, it's good for a rental and don't forget the popcorn.",4.0
"Unfortunately, Barbra Streisand got a hold of an absolutely classic Pat Conroy novel and sensationalized her role to position herself for an oscar. While the main storyline is intact, so much of the novel is missing from the film that the viewer is truly cheated. I am not a fan of Babs, but I will give her credit for an excellent acting and production job. It's sad, however, that it had to come at the expense of this momentous story.
There is no one that could have been casted for the part of Tom other than Nick Nolte. He is fabulous and portrays the role of the 'southern male' as well as anyone could. Anyone with a heart for the South should read the book, and then see the film, if it comes on cable.",4.0
"Though Barbra Streisand kind of gets in the way of her own movie, The Prince of Tides does have some expertly compelling sequences, most chillingly the flashbacks that seriously do justice to Pat Conroy's epic  novel.  Dealing most significantly with the inner child, and the  revelations that can free us, the book and the film successfully engage you  with a rich sense of time and place.  The characters who populate the film  sometimes seem from two different worlds, but I think that is part of the  point.  Kate Nelligan and Jason Gould will surprise you with unusually good  performances, and of course, Nick Nolte does some of his best acting ever  in this film -- the role suits him; even its grander touches seem so - so -  Tom.  The score, by James Newton Howard, swirls symphonically around the  action of this movie, and is achingly beautiful.",4.0
"This is not a horror movie.  This film does not compare well with horror movies.  This is an action movie with zombies.  It compares very well with other action movies.  Starting where Resident Evil ended, the bullets start flying and the zombies start chomping immediately (do watch RE before this one).  Although the script is hardly award winning, the movie delivers much more than you would reasonably expect from a video game based zombie movie.  The actors are capable enough, and even if you find them stiff and generic, it's okay - most of them don't survive very long.  Sadly, the comedy relief guy isn't funny at all and he does survive the whole movie.  Also, the martial arts and special effects are good overall (except for the CGI Dobermans which are awful).  Somehow the film avoids being predictable and sets up the last part of the trilogy nicely.  Whether or not you've played the video game (I haven't), Resident Evil: Apocalypse is sure to satisfy cravings for a fast-paced action movie with sexy, gun-toting, butt-kicking babes if you can forgive a few rather forced script elements (like main characters strolling through a graveyard totally oblivious to the risk this involves during a zombie uprising!)",4.0
"This 1st Resident Evil movie directed by AVP director Paul W. S. Anderson was actually pretty darn good. Much better than the next movie in this trilogy, Apocalypse. (But the next one, Extinction, looks the very best!)

But this 1st movie was a thrill ride with solid acting and good action sequences, some never seen before, which is always a good thing. And it ends with a shocker! Leaving the movie watcher wanting more.

Milla Jovovich does her best acting thus far in this movie, carrying the movie that most action women can't do. She didn't do the 2nd movie justice, and didn't look as good either. But then, the whole 2nd movie was a mess. Bad B movie.

This is a B-movie that looks and acts like a grade A movie.

And the third one - Extinction - coming out this September looks like the biggest and best one thus far. Looking forward to it.",4.0
"This is a great sequel to the original. Although it didn't seem as dark and scary as the first, it made up for it in action. The movie picks up where the first one left off. As our heroine has escaped the hospital she finds a devastated world. She must find her only surviving friend and do what she can to bring the Umbrella Corporation down. She finds out more horrible truths about them and is assisted by a unlikely allie. Both movies complement each other nicely. I definitely recommend you add this to your Horror/SciFi collection. A must for anyone that owns ""Resident Evil"". I am looking forward to the third movie in this set.",4.0

You've already got the basic story line from other folks and apparently this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' type. Maybe if you can see the movie while putting aside the game you'll have a better time. Just sit back and enjoy the story and the action. You'll do just fine.",4.0
"Its an average blu-ray, but I love the movie itself. I guess I am a Milla fan.",4.0
"Ok, If you are a die hard original RE fan you should really go see this movie.. Although it does not stick to the original story line as in the Playstation version of the game, It does however touch on some of the events.  I rated it 4 stars only because I thought If they actually sticked with the original story, they would have made for a really good movie.  You know.. Creeping around an old Mansion and finding trap doors and having zombies fly out at you.. Im so addicted to the original game.. that it is somewhat sad.. The game just rocks..

  Anyways, getting back to the movie, if you love zombie movies and played alot of Resident Evil.. this is a must see... It's definetly filled with action and gives you more of an idea on how the T-VIRUS came about, and how evil the Umbrella Corporation can be.",4.0

"I recently watched this again after getting my 5.1 on and was suprised at how entertaining it was.

Here are some reasons I found to like it:

1. Sinister corporate paranoia - The idea that things could go terribly wrong when the activities of large, greedy corporations are left unchecked is not exactly far-fetched. The creepy goings on at the Umbrella Corp present a currently relevent scenario.

2. Hot chicks - Milla & Michelle are worth watching anytime; but especially when they do the tough-girl thing.

  Milla looks particularly nice when semi-nude.

3. Delivers the goods - When it comes time for action, suspence & zombie attacks, this flick is fun.

4. Industrial setting - If you like that asthetic, lots of cement and steel for you. Industrial music too!

 While not going down in history as a genre classic ( it's not doing anything inventive or original ), it's actually a pretty good time for the monster movie crowd. What it lacks for in substance, it makes up for in atmosphere, brisk pacing and visceral thrills.",4.0
"While I love that they are doing movies for the Resident Evil, and that they have chosen Milla Jovovich I was left slightly unsatisfied with this movie. I saw the first one and completely enjoyed it from start to finish. With this one I wasn't sure if they were trying to not spend as much money and give a few cheap shots during the action. I am not sure if anyone else notices the changes in the lens in way like what was done in moments in Collateral damage. If you wish to explain why they do this by all means please write me a comment. Where the action was done with normal shots I enjoyed each and every stunt, shot, and explosion. Overall the acting was decent just what is needed in an action movie, but all I have to do is remind myself that I am not watching it for academy preformances. Overall I did enjoy the movie even with my personal annoyance at the shots, I was glad about the stunning ending that they left us with. one more important note I left in my head as I watched the movie, a note that everyone should leave in their head... that in a series the second movie is the bridge between the first movie to the third one so basically go easier on it, it did it's job succesfully and I will be going to the theatres once again to see the third and adding to my shelf once it is released.",4.0
Yes I did,4.0
"Resident Evil: Apocalypse has made some big changes ever since the first Resident Evil and trust me they are worth seeing. This movie is full of scary parts and humorous moments and great action sequences that trust me you will never forget. I was a little disappointed though on how this movie was not as scary and sinister as the first But many people jumped at many various parts of the movie including me.

Alot people have been talking about the zombies lately. I would have to say they were not scary...they seemed to be alot weaker as if you could push them over. I took it as kind of a joke and sometimes it makes you want to take pictures of the zombies then laugh later. But new creatures have emerged and are even more sinister like the ""Nemesis"" and the ""licker"".

Second the addition of ""Jill Valentine"" was simply very intelligent but you did not get to see her in full action. She was a little too much of the ""sidekick"" but you do see her kicking zombie [...]!!!

The visuals were amazing. The story was very good and you always wonder what will happen next. There is also the addition of new humorous moments that make you laugh by a new actor in the movie. The fight scenes were GREAT. THIS IS DEFINELTY A MUST HAVE!!!!!!",4.0
"Anyone who has watched ""The Claim,"" with Milla Jovavich, and then the ""Resident Evil,"" movies, would have to shake their head a few times and say, Is this the same actress?  Well, yes it is.  And I like both.  In the Claim, a retelling of Thomas Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, you see MJ give a performance that should of at least netted her an academy award nomination (and she can sing!).  But the Academy, being the sink hole it now is, ignored that wonderful movie and the performances in it.  Fast forward things a few years, and Milla is kicking tail in better than Tomb Raider style.  A business decision on MJ's part?  Who knows?  But Hollywood can be cruel to women as they age.  For my money, it's clear MJ can do anything, and if B-movie Superchick is her choice, then enjoy the ride.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the kind of movie that critics hate, and movie goers love.  It's fast, it's furious, and don't try to make much sense of it (Example: the motorcycle crashing through the church window.  But hey!  It LOOKED great!).  Devil dogs, zombies (very lame ones, who fail the Romero zombie shuffle test), evil corporate scientists, and a band of heros out to save a little girl.  That's all you probably need to know.  This particular chapter of the RE series is probably closer than the original as far as aping the game, with various moments in various rooms where something hideous awaits.  As genre work, this movie is pretty good, with one star missing due to zombies being used as only background noise. Check it out!",4.0
"Horror flicks aren't my favorites, but Resident Evil was good enough, I love the Resident Evil's games they are so scary as ""hell"",the cast isn't so good, I don't think Milla Jovovich is a good actress(see UltraViolet aka:UltraMediocrity to know what i'm taking about) but her acting wasn't that bad in this one, Michelle Rodrguez was fantastic(i hate she dies in this movie, a reason why i dislike Residen Evil: Apocalypse),the suporting cast was really really bad (except Michelle) is like you see the American Pie band fighting with zombies , the direction wasn't that bad too, i never heard about Mr. Paul Anderson in my whole-life, the story well is good not so original but with some excellent twists, visuals are good no more no less, the zombies aren't so scary like you think but the monsters looked really good,i don't think Mr. Romero gets angry if he see  Residen Evil,a good movie nothing spectacular but if you compare Resident Evil with Super Mario Bros. The Movie, Street Fighter, House of Dead, Alone in The Dark,Doom... then you will have a worth oscar winner movie, i love the DVD, has a lot of really good material but then if you are looking a rental this a excellent option or even if you are fan of Residen Evil games  you must see it, worth the rental or buy(if you really like it).

"Muchos fans se quejaron de la adaptacion de la historia del videojuego a la pelicula, sin embargo es necesario crear un guion muy diferente para una pelicula que finalmente fue hecha como un negocio, esto tomando en cuenta que esta pelicula no es de tipo B. En un juicio personal creo que fue una adaptacion muy buena en la cual solo toman los temas principales de la historia original y actualizan el ambiente del laboratorio, ademas seamos realistas, una corporacin multinacional tan grande como Umbrella merecia  un lugar mas digno, no creen?

Personalmente me gusto mas esta pelcula que su continuacin, en la segunda se fueron mas por el lado comercial y taquillero, obviamente la primera tambien lo fue, pero no tanto como la segunda.

En resumen es una muy buena pelcula comercial de Zombies, cuenta con buenos efectos y ese par sustos que nos hacen brincar en el momento menos esperado y lo mejor de todo... tiene a Milla. ;)",4.0

"This movie had me going for a while. At first I thought that they would base is on the acclaimed capcom resident evil. Thought that they would base it on the frist game in the series. If you really wanna know where it fits in the series, it's sort of like a prequel to the events that unfolded. The mansion in the movie is not the one in the game. It takes place at a different mansion but takes place during the first game. This movie left me shocked most of the time what with the countless surprises and consistant 'have to hurry' flow. It's the perfect begining to kick off the series. The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is becuase the zombie effects could've been a littl better. But, other than that, that's all.

"In 2002, audiences and critics alike were surprised by the success of the video game inspired hit ""Resident Evil"".  Though critics and even some moviegoers didn't feel the movie was worthy of receiving a sequel, even though the ending was left wide open and a sequel was needed for some sort of resolution to the story, the studio execs were clearly listening to those that enjoyed the movie and decided to buck the critics and released ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"".  The same people that despised the first film were bashing the release of its sequel with just as much passion; however, upon it's release the film managed to silence many of its attackers.  Not settling for merely making a sequel for money alone, writer Paul W. S. Anderson (the writer/director of ""Resident Evil"") crafted an even bigger, better, and more action packed thriller for the follow-up, and succinctly silenced the nay-sayers with a sequel that ties up all loose ends from the original film, serving as an excellent addition to a budding franchise.

""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" begins directly where ""Resident Evil"" left off, starting with a flashback sequence that serves as a refresher course for the audience so that all are on the same page when the action really gets going.  Surviving the zombie attacks in the underground compound of the Umbrella Corporation, Alice (Milla Jovovich) arrives in Raccoon City, located right next to the compound, and discovers that she is too late.  The entire city has apparently been overrun by zombies, with most of the city in ruins, Alice begins searching for any non-infected survivors.  She finds a few companions that are willing to take the fight to the zombies, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), well-armed and ready for action these compatriots set out to rid Raccoon City of the evil unleashed by Umbrella Corporation.  However, Umbrella Corp. has a surprise for our heroes, a nasty mutated form of zombie known as Nemesis.  With supplies becoming drastically limited, it appears that time is running out for our heroes, and humanity's days could be numbered.

As I stated earlier, ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" is simply a better film than its predeccesor, in terms of acting, storytelling, pacing, and action.  To be fair, ""Resident Evil"" is merely the opening chapter to this much bigger story that is told in ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"", and in truth, neither of the two films hold up on their own.  Director Alexander Witt brings his valuable experience as a much respected 2nd Unit Director from his previous film experiences, ""Gladiator"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" to name a couple, giving the material a more mature, polished appearance that the original film lacked.  The special effects, including the practical and make-up effects, are all improved in ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"".  A very good decision was made in having the Nemesis monster not be just another CGI character, but be a physical man in a suit, it is with the Nemesis character that the make-up and practical effects team really shined.  The acting and storytelling were much improved from the original film, and the addition of Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera from the video games was an especially nice touch.

Overall, ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" is a very solid, zombie thriller that doesn't stand up well on it's own, but when coupled with the first film, the two make for a very entertaining thrill ride of zombie mayhem.

""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.",4.0
"Video games have been entertaining kids, teenagers, and adults consistently for about the last 25 years.  From Pong to Madden, Pac-Man to Tomb Raider, there is not a single doubt in anyone's mind that though most games have been created for entertainment purposes only, and that the graphics have significantly improved through every generation of gaming.  There are some games that standout from the rest in terms of almost movie quality experience within the game, from intense stories, stunningly realistic graphics, and for the most part solid voice acting, many of today's video game franchises have felt like they are movies that players have full control over.  Such franchises are extremely successful, some examples would be; `Silent Hill 1-4', all of the `Tomb Raider' games, and the controversial `Grand Theft Auto' franchise.  One of the most popular video games with that cinematic quality would have to be the `Resident Evil' series.  With its eerie and creepy storyline and music, dark and dangerous environments that are loaded with evil zombies waiting to kill you, and the great voice-over actors used to bring your favorite characters to life, it is clear why this franchise is one of the strongest franchises to this day, even after having 3 sequels and a prequel game released in the series.  Many of these video game franchises have been so successful that even Hollywood has begun to take notice, recent Hollywood movies based on video game franchises have been pretty much hit-and-miss in terms of loyalty to the source material and interest from the general movie-going public.  The failures would have to be ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"", ""Alone In the Dark"", ""Mortal Kombat"", and ""Bloodrayne"", the successes have basically been between two franchises the `Tomb Raider' franchise starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft in ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Tomb Raider:  The Cradle of Life"", and the Milla Jovovich thrillers ""Resident Evil"" and ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"".  It just so happens that this review is for ""Resident Evil"", look for future reviews to feature my opinions on both the good and bad adaptations.

""Resident Evil"" begins with a paramilitary commando team invading a house that appears to be mostly vacant except for a strange woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich).  Upon further searching of the grounds, it appears that all is not as it seems, and that this house is really a cover for a secret underground facility set up by the evil Umbrella Corporation.  Though Alice doesn't recall what has happened in the recent days, except for the bits and pieces she receives via flashbacks, she quickly begins to understand that there is definitely something awry with this facility.  A fact that is proven to be correct by the existence of zombies that have begun hunting the paramilitary team.  As if the zombies weren't enough to contend with, it seems that the facility's defense mechanism has been activated and the facility itself is hunting the commandos.  Now, all are in a race for their lives to escape the facility without letting any of the zombies make it to the surface.

Writer/Director Paul W. S. Anderson really had his work cut out for him when releasing this movie.  With previous video game adaptations failing at the box office, many movie-goers and critics were highly skeptical that any video game franchise could translate well onto the big screen.  Understanding that his biggest asset would be to not assume that everyone knows the source material, i.e. the video game, Anderson crafted a story that stays true to the video games, even feels like it could have come from any of the video game installments, yet also stands on it's own as a separate creation.  The actors are all very talented, and all give solid, realistic performances that serve to raise the movie up from being a simple video game adaptation and/or zombie movie into a truly suspenseful thrill-ride that doesn't require any knowledge of the source material so that all movie audiences can walk right into the theater and be on the same page in terms of what's occuring in the movie.  The special effects work for the most part is very well done, a few scenes are a little weak, but I understand that the studio might not want to risk breaking the bank on a video game franchise that isn't a guaranteed success at the box office.

Though I enjoyed ""Resident Evil"", I must admit that upon my first viewing of the movie I wasn't as enthralled by it.  This has mostly to do with the fact that there is a wide open ending to the movie, there is some resolution, but for the most part the story is left open and screaming for a sequel.  Since I saw the movie within a few weeks of its arrival on DVD, there had not been any announcement made regarding a future sequel.  Without a sequel the story is incomplete, and therefore a let down.  However a year later Columbia Pictures announced that they had begun production on ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse"" and that the basic story written again by Paul W. S. Anderson, would pick up directly where ""Resident Evil"" left off.  Needless to say, this made me happy and so when the sequel came out on DVD I rented both movies and watched them back to back.  By doing this I was treated to a complete story that is truly too big to fit into one movie and the need for two movies to tell one story made sense, and I was no longer frustrated with the first film.  With all that being said, if you are wanting to watch ""Resident Evil"", please keep in mind that you need to rent the sequel at the same time or shortly after viewing the first film so that you will get the complete movie experience as it was intended to be.

"I went to see this film when it first came out and I was syked since I love the video game.  I was wanting to be scared to death but that didn't happen.  I didn't even get a shiver.  The film is done as a action film, not a thriller so don't expect to piss your pants in fear.  The action scenes are decent and the gore level is up there...some of the CGI is a little corny but Jovovich is enough to make you forgive the defects of the film.  It's fun and entertaining while not living up to the hype I placed on it.  I give it four stars because for what it is, an action film with a beautiful star, it pulls through.  It just doesn't have the same feel the video game has...it doesn't do the game justice in that respect.  But if you want to see a bunch of people shooting zombies and rabbid dogs then this is for you.",4.0

"It seems that one cannot swing a dead cat without hitting a zombie these days.  In this ultra-modern zombie flick, Milla Jovovich plays Alice and takes a train down the rabbit hole to battle human and dog zombies and an evil computer, the Red Queen (off with her head!).

This is one of those love-it or hate-it movies.  I loved it.  This is one of the best game-based movies out there.  Sure, the zombie thread is standard fare (a virus causes a zombie plague and a group of people fight to survive), but there are good special effects.

The movie is very fast-paced, mindless and filled with action, good sound effects and soundtrack.  Not surprisingly, this movie is quite violent and depicts a lot of gore.

On the extended DVD, there are some interesting extras.  I thought the piece on the makeup for the Zombie Dogs was fun.",4.0
"This is a great movie for all of you gamers out there. I enjoyed it. It wasent all that bad. I am gonna talk about the dvd aspects of it. I AM GONNA TALK ABOUT THE DELUXE EDITION.

  IMAGE:

The 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen image looks brillantly,hi-tech,smooth,sharp, and clear. The picture quality is not as good as the SuperBit DVD's video only when it comes to shadow-rendering. Had the SuperBit disc not existed, then this one would be great for showing off your expensive new TV.

  SOUND:

The state-of-the-art Dolby Digital 5.1 sound design is tremendous. Sound effects ricochet around the room courtesy of five very active channels and an overactive mix. In fact,the subwoofer isn't made just to thump,rather,the sound designers created a low bass feed that thumps creatively,pulsingly,so you won't hear/feel a continous boom but a mix of booms that will rock you to your bones. However,since everything is so damn loud, you might have to constantly adjust your volume settings in order to hear the actor's dialogue and to avoid blowing out your speakers. There's also a DD 2.0 surround Spanish track, Optional English,French,Portuguese,and Spanish subtitles as well as optional English closed captions support the audio.

  SPECIAL FEATURES:

The original Special Edition had a decent collection of extras. The Deluxe Edition is a simple expansion of the Special Edition, so it's up to you if you want to buy it.

The first extras are two audio commentaries. From the first Special Edition we get and audio commentary bu Paul W.S. Anderson. Milla Jovovich,Michelle Rodriquez and producer Jeremy Bolt. They share a lot of laughs about the movie while they discuss what was done to create each scene that flickers across the screen. This is actually fun,enjoyable commentary even though the commentators are talking about a dreary,dreadful enterprise. The other audio commentary features members of the visual effects team, and as expected, this is a technicalminded and occasionaly boring track if you're not a total tech wonk.

Next up are eleven featurettes. The featurettes have names that are self-explanatory. The eleven featurettes are

"well i have to admit they did a great job for a sequel to resident evil.

if your into resident evil or if you like action/horror flicks then this is a must see.

i enjoyed this movie they had more money to spend in making it compared to the first one.

in short this movie takes off where resident evil left off and shows a virus breakout onto the city of raccoon.

now i don't want to reveal to much ill try to keep it short so as i said above the virus was released due to the fact that umbrella scientist wanted to go back and reopen the hive to see what happen to the hive.

they underestimated the outbreak of the virus with in the hive which in turn they couldn't contain it and was released onto the city.

alice was awaken as well as nemisis an alternate plan of umbrella to see which is stronger and be more viable as a bio weapon.

that is about all i will say if i told the whole story you wouldnt want to see the movie.

the actors did a great job once again bringing it to life as well as some comedy in the movie as well.

i enjoyed this but i liked the original better anyway if you collect resident evil items then this is a must have as well as a must see.

i rated it a four star due to the fact that some of the special effects just didn't fit in place with the movie as well as they did what they could on making nemisis real but with todays technology i feel they couldve done better.

the pace of the movie is nonstop and the feel of the movie was great as well as the sounds effects were great also.

the other con to the movie was the film angle of the zombies or how should i put it they zipped them in and out persay its hard to describe once you see the movie youll know what i mean.

now the other con is the zombies themselves before i saw land of the dead i thought resident evil zombies were great and made perfect but when i saw land of the dead and george romero zombies well im sorry romero wins hands down.

i feel that they couldve done a better job with makeup and effects on the zombies but it looked like they spent alot on the lickers in the movie so that mightve put a crimp in there budget and they had to let some things go as far as in detail.

overall its a great movie and a must see and turn out the lights grab some popcorn get ready for some good fun.",4.0
Still a classic...,4.0
"I remember going to watch the first installment of this series with my old friend in the cinema. And I have to say it was really great and alot of fun, even if some things were a little questionable. A little while ago I watched ""Resident Evil - Apocalypse"" on DVD. And I found it to be very good, but it just wasn't as good as the original. Allow me to elaborate a little...

""R.E - Apocalypse"" picks up from the ending of ""R.E."" Basically, we find that Raccoon City is under siege by a terrible plague that brings the dead to life (surprise!). We are soon introduced to some new characters, one being Jill Valentine (played by Sienna Guillory). Now when I saw Jill for the first time she looked exactly like the Jill from the games - except here she has black rather than brown hair! It's a minor thing of course, but obviously sufficient attention wasn't given to the appearance of characters. Anyway, Jill's ruthless and good with a gun, and that's all that matters. Later on we also meet Carlos Olivera (played by Oded Fehr. Carlos was from the third Resident Evil Game). He's a leader and a great fighter, but this Carlos is much older than the Carlos from the game. Nemesis is pretty well done but his face just looks slightly different from what I remember. And the Nemesis in the movie has some pretty massive guns, which is true to the games as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, all the human characters trapped in the city must escape Raccoon City before dawn or they'll all be turned into Nuclear Pulp. The storyline is similar to the games but it's not particularly original. Overall characters get 7/10 and the storyline gets 6/10.

The monsters in ""R.E - Apocalypse"" are well done, but the zombies are not as gruesome as they were in the previous movie. Those creatures with the massive tongues are pretty well done and the mutant Dobermans are great. I've already talked about Nemesis, so I'll continue...all creatures and monsters have unique characteristics and are pretty ugly for the most part, so I'll give monsters and creatures 8/10. The zombies are not always completely convincing, but the zombie kids were awesome! No doubt about that...

The structure of the film is a little disjointed at times and not really condusive to an action film, but it's forgivable as the action scenes more than compensate for this. The explosions are big, the conflict violent and complex, and the drama convincing.  In this respect I'll give ""R.E - Apocalypse"" 8/10 for action and drama, but 6/10 for the structure. It's just what I felt, so don't take it as an attack on you if you enjoyed the stucture. Conversely one could say that the disjointed structure merely heightens the drama, so perhaps structure deserves 7/10. But it's your choice and opinion that inevitably matters.

I think the setting of a chaotic city is fascinating and the environments are nicely done. Well, perhaps I should say the environments look like they've been ravaged and destroyed. There were plenty of zombies, lots of broken glass and abandoned vehicles, blood spatters and finally empty streets. The environments are very convincing and deserve 9/10. Perhaps the directors could've used filters in some places to enhance the film and its tension, but perhaps it would've made it more of an Art Movie, which it definitely is not! So that comment is just an aside from me...

One thing I found to be funny was Stefan Hayes' (or Yuri Loginova's) extremely dodgy Russian accent! At times he got the accent nailed, but there were instances where he sounded like an American or an angry European! Look, it didn't bother me much and he doesn't speak that much in the movie. All I can say is that I've met Russian people, and if you think THAT's Russian, well...it's not I'm afraid. It's not hard to miss his poor accent, it's extremely noticeable.

Overall ""Resident Evil - Apocalypse"" gets 75% according to my percentage system. It's fun and entertaining but is extremely far fetched in some cases (an example of this is when Alice arrives in the nick of time to save Valentine (et al) by smashing through a stained-glass window on a motorcycle, then landing and back-flipping off. The bike then ramps and she fires to shots that hit the gas tank, causing the bike to combust and killing some of the long tongued creatures. I'm sorry, she may be super, but that's a steaming pile of goat s***) and is flawed in many places. Don't get me wrong, I'll watch it again, but it's no classic and certainly not totally well done. And if you think that's wrong, ask a stuntman to backflip off a bike, ramp it and blow it up without killing himself. I rest my case. So it's a cool film, but nothing I would call special. Buy if you like, it's a 50-50 for me...",4.0
"From all the reviews I've read for this movie, they're pretty mixed in opinion. Some people Have been ranging on about how the movie sucked and how ""scantly dressed"" the female characters (I.E., Jill Valentine and Alice) are and ect. But really, the reviews --- for the most part--- could not be more far from the truth than the Miami Dolphins lost in Baltimore. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is the coolest movie of late summer 2004, only second to ""Spider-Man II."" It's that great of a movie. Contrary to belief, ""Resident Evil"" had a major scare factor for me, I still cannot will myself to watch the Claustrophobic-filmed movie that left me with a sense of hopelessness for the characters as they were attacked by the former ""Hive"" employees of the Umbrella Corporation. So you can believe that when I heard ""RE:A"" was on Television (7-2-05) I had a pretty hard time willing myself to watch it. I was that scared of it. I had watched enough for the first movie to understand the sequel:

- [The Umbrella CORP. has reopened the hive after capturing Matt (Eric Malbus) and Alice from their narrow escape from the hive upon sealing it to prevent further contamination. Both have been subjected to laboratory experiments with the T-Virus under the orders of men named Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen - Tomb Raider), but only Alice is left partially unscathed through the entire incident. However, Alice's attempts to keep the T-virus from escaping the underground facility were foiled by the Umbrella CORP when they reopen the HIVE and released the T-Virus and the lickers along with it. Thus creating mass hysteria within the walls of Raccoon City whose citizens have fallen prey to the deadly virus and are locked inside the city when it reaches the city limits.

Jill Valentine (from CAPCOM's Resident Evil game series, played by Sienna Guillory) a S.T.A.R.S. operative who was suspended for her accusations against the Umbrella CORP., her partner Pyeton Wells (Razaaq Adoti), along with whether reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt), take refuge in a church after Pyeton is bitten by one of the recently undead at the city gate and are met with more trouble. Their saving grace happens to be ""PROGRAM"" Alice (Milla Jovovich!!) who has been genetically enhanced by the T-virus and Anti-virus, armed to the teeth with guns of every kind and superhuman strength to boot.

The newfound group of survivors make their way through the city toward a hopeful exit before Raccoon City is sanitized by a Nuclear Missile strong enough to reradiate the virus and everything else. They're then contacted by Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), the creator of the T-virus, who wants them to head to the school where his daughter Angela ""Angie"" Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur; ""Evelyn - 2001"") --- whom he designed the ""RED QUEEN"" after ---- is hiding out after the van she was in was hit with a Semi truck. Right behind them S.T.A.R.S. elite Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and Nicholai Sokolov (whom was a villain in the game. ---- played by Zack Ward) and the wandering Raccoon City resident pimp L.J. (Mike Epps) who also get a call from the so-called ""Dr. Doom. Unbeknownst to the group as they approach the school, the Umbrella CORP. has unleashed their ultimate Bio-weapon ""PROGRAM"" Nemesis (from Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Played by Matthew G. Taylor and not Eric Malbus) monitored by Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann), whose primary objective is to kill all the S.T.A.R.S. members that were still alive and battle Alice for superiority of sorts.]""

---------- Apocalypse deals heavily with Alice regaining her forgotten memory after she is captured and subjected to tests and the secondary star of the movie ""Nemesis"" who was her friend, Matt Addison. While the movie deals with the subject of the undead, the plot is strictly character driven in the every way possible; You actual care about what will happen to all the people who survived the outbreak in Raccoon City. The scare factor in the movie for me has diminished somewhat after I conquered my fear of watching it but it still holds some kind of fear over me when it comes to all the Undead scenes which are truly something to be scared about for the ""most"" part. Milla Jovovich's character Alice kicks Jill Valentine (who really isn't given much to do in the movie) to the passengers seat and really kicks major ass in this movie, the action scenes in this movie are a sight to behold, its practically nonstop through out the entire movie but does nothing to dissipate the movie's twisting plot.

Alice's stunts are the coolest ever--- from the graveyard battle, the 100-Foot dash down City Hall (which Milla did the last of the stunt herself) to her battle with Nemesis, the action for this character is undeniably the best ever and better than her exploits in the first movie. Jill Valentine, however, manages to hold a special place in my heart and basically gets to do some pretty awesome things herself (Fighting the undead to some wicked handgun fights) but her range is basically limited since the movie is focused on Alice. The comic Relief provided by Mike Epps' character ""L.J. ,"" is actually pretty funny and does not kill the atmosphere of horror/action in the movie.

Oded Fehr does pretty a pretty good job with the limited character Carlos Olivera, he's never too macho and his character is quite likable (much like Nicholai was). Most of all the music is well fitted and plays best on the most important parts of movie overall. Best of all, Resident Evil: Apocalypse deals heavily with the video games in only a way the fanboys of the games would recognize. All in all this movie was up-to-specs and majorly different from the horde of Horror movies concerning the Undead that came out in 2004. There are indeed, plot holes big enough to stick your finger through but this does nothing to diminish the movie's high-rate enjoyment. Purchase this movie if your a fan of Milla Jovovich or the Resident Evil series, but consider this movie with an open mind. This movie contains brief scenes of nudity, mild-swearing, gory scenes, frightening images, and nonstop action violence (Written by Paul Anderson, Directed by Alexander Witt). FYI: The female protagonists, Jill and Alice are not ""scantly dressed"" they're quite covered with clothing for combat and easy mobility -----[a 5 out of 5]",4.0

"These movies were both good sci-fi/ action/ horror movies that are still inferior to the Blade trilogy. So if you want to have the best sci-fi/ horror movies of the 2, Blade's better. If you want to have the classic, check out the Alien Quadrilogy, but if you just want to have some fun, buy this set. They're both good, solid movies with good suspense and great action and special effects.

Resident Evil (# 1) is about a group of soldiers that must destroy a virus before it has a deadly effect on the world.

Resident Evil Apocalypse- Alice played by Mila Jockavich has to help fight the undead and has to rescue a missing girl.

Both movies have good action scenes where you'll be like:"" wow! That was cool!!"" but the 2nd one is better with better action and more memorable stuff. I recommend them as rents to everyone and buys for absolute die hard funs. You'll just have a good time watching them.",4.0
"At the end of the first movie we were left with a bit of a cliff hanger.  In this one we see just how the cliff hanger came about and how it is resolved.  Racoon City has been ravaged by the T-Virus and its ability to animate dead tissue.  The city has been walled off from the rest of the world by the Umbrella Corporation.

Umbrella's interest in the city is varied.  Can the city be reclaimed?  Can the virus be contained?  But it also provides a chance for proper field testing of other projects, particularly Project Nemesis.  Through all of this we follow a handful of survivors as they try to stay alive long enough to find a way out of the city.  In the background a third party is pulling stings for his own benefit to locate his daughter who was left behind in the city.

The film is full of action and fighting.  There is less suspense than in the first and most of the monsters and hazards are straight from the first movie.  But it is the characters and what has been done to them, and how they handle it, that provides the real story in this film.  Needless to say there is another cliffhanger/opening at the end to pave the way for a third movie.  Most of the action happens at night so the sets are dark.  The action is fast and between the lighting and the speed, the fight scenes are often uncomprehendable.

If you liked the first movie or the games, you will probably like this one as it is not just a rehashing of previous stories.",4.0
"This movie is more base on the video then the first movie was. I have to say the action is better on the second. The woman name Alice doesn't feel or function like a human.

Theirs not much blood in the movie compaired to the first movie and mutant lickers don't look as scary this time. That's why only four stars.",4.0

"I feel that both of these films are somewhat underrated.  They were hurt by critics who sort of missed the point and by video gamers who expected them to be carbon-copies of the games.  They are, simply, very good zombie movies - lots of campy fun, great action, and even some genuine scares.  They're just fun to watch, and one of the big reasons for that is Milla - who looks great and is just perfect for this role, simultaneously strong and vulnerable.  (An earlier review said these were among her first films - in fact, she has been acting since 1991, when she famously appeared nude at age 14 in ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"".  She is a veteran actress with nearly 20 films to her credit.)

It is true that these films don't do much that's new with the genre - if that's what you're looking for, see ""28 Days Later"" instead.  But the Resident Evil films do the traditional zombie genre as well as any film has recently, with great special effects (these were big-budget films), good acting and a lot of action.",4.0
"This review is really aimed more at the UMD version for the PSP. If you want a review of the movie, there are plenty of those here...

After placing the UMD in the PSP, it's immediately obvious that even at full volume, the built-in audio for the PSP just won't cut it for movies. The dialog is barely audible, while the explosions, gunshots, etc. are blaring. To combat this, try a couple of things:

1. Access the movie menu and increase the volume output

2. Turn off the volume limiter

3. Use some external speakers or headphones

4. Turn off the EQ - EQ should be flat

I used some speakers for the movie, and the experience was great. I hadn't seen the movie before, and it looked great on the PSP's screen. Of the PSP's UMD titles available, this is one of the better ones.",4.0
good movie but it keeps stopping towards the end don't no why,4.0
"I have played almost every Resident Evil game that's come out from the first to the latest and greatest Resident Evil 4.  When this movie came out I was pretty hesitant.  Would they do a remake of the first game or would they create an entirely new movie?  And which would I rather they did?  Having seen this movie and the second movie's attempt to incorporate actual video game parts and movie parts, I must say I'm relieved they didn't remake the first Resident Evil movie.

Instead, they created new characters and created a semi-backstory to the events of Resident Evil the video game.  And, also surprisingly, it works pretty well!  What helps is that we have two cool actresses, Michelle Rodriguez and the always enjoyable Milla Jovovich.  But what also worked for this movie is the tension and suspense that built from the very beginning to the exciting climax.

At the beginning of the movie, we have fully clad men and women ready to kick ass but through a series of events, they end up losing lives and most of their ammo.  That is when the true Survival Horror that the video game stands for begins.

Now granted this movie is a rip off of many different and better sci-fi and horror films from Alien to the countless zombie films that have been made.  But what it lacks in originality, it makes up in style.  The action and violence is pretty stylized and it was fun to pick up some RE connections.  You're not looking at an Oscar-winning movie of course, nor is it as good as some of the zombie movies out there (28 Days Later, both versions of Dawn of the Dead, etc) but for what it is, it is very well done.

And, for whatever you can say about the movie in a negative light, Paul Anderson handles the subject matter much more deftly than Uwe Boll could ever do with his own Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead films.  So far, Resident Evil stands tall as the best and, sadly enough, most faithful video game movie yet.  That's not saying too much, given the competition, but it's still a fun, mindless romp through familiar territory.  And it could have been a lot worse.",4.0
"it was sad and happy, held your interest.",4.0
"I read a review when this movie was released. It claimed that the direction was schizophrenic. Well I decided to see the film and prove that critic wrong. He was right. It was in so, so many ways a great film. The flashback of the rapes handled deftly. It could have been perfection, though...with a little editing. The movie poster needed to be edited. We had ""A Star is Born"". It made money but wasn't very good. This movie is not a love story. The ""love story"" was a contrived by-product of a harrowing psychological tragedy. What we get is Barbra in Daddy's arms again. Enough already. After crossing what are questionable ethical boundaries and having sex with Mr. Wingo, there is this cheesy romp to the cabin in the woods to somehow legitimize this ""relationship"". Edit: Barbra and Nick f**k like animals in the doorway. Cut: to Barbra crossing the street knowing he'll return to his wife. No romp in the woods! The movie would stay hard and dead serious. Also, the pan away in the last frames. ""Lowenstein, Lowenstein"" Bullcrap, Bullcrap  How many Fanny Brice, Yentyl, Daisy Gamble, Dolly (I think) pan aways have we seen. It lost it's appeal. And she's only there by proxy, ""Lowenstein"" Those are the two major reasons I can see that the Academy snubbed her. It was definitely a time when harder movies were in vogue. She got in her own way even when she attempted to get out of her way. It could have been a great film that wasn't a Streisand star turn. She has star turned enough. Barbra's part could have been smaller and much more effective. She might have come across as a temptress, a slut, desperate, but she would have won an Oscar and made a truly Great film for its time.",4.0
"Would you like to know why this one wasn't a waste of time like the first movie?  One reason: Paul Anderson didn't direct it.  Mr. WS Anderson seems to have a knack for taking it upon himself to helm larger scale films with infinite potential and make total crap out of them (which he finally managed to steer away from when AVP rolled around), but since he did not direct this installment, it turned out all right.  He did write it, and that I can live with, because his scripts are very visionary and he is a wonderful writer, just not the best filmmaker in the world.

I've rambled on about him long enough, now let's talk about the movie.  Just a day after the events which took place in Resident Evil, one of the two survivors, Alice (Milla Jovivich), has been taken to Raccoon City hospital and quarantined, where she has been experimented on.  Meanwhile, scientists have ventured back into the hive, where they manage to release the hord of zombies still roaming around down there.  Just thirteen hours later, the city is infested with them, and Alice, who has escaped the facility, must escape with another group of survivors, including STARS special againt Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr).  However, this proves to be quite a task for them, as they are not only hindered by mindless, flesh-eating zombies and lightning fast undead canines, but Umbrella Corporation has also unleashed their newest weapon, a 7 foot hulking monstrosity with incredible firepower, code-named Nemesis.

While edgy and seemingly pointless in a few spots, Resident Evil: Apocalypse proves quite an advantage over its predecessor.  The acting is quite well done, the writing seems planned out well and is whitty while sticking to the main points of the movie {kudos to Mr. Anderson), and the zombies are looking pretty juicy!  Not only that, but we are treated to a couple fairly graphic munching scenes.  I was also a little relieved the zombies remained slow, because if they had been very fast (ala Dawn of the Dead '04), there would seem to be no hope, as they've got the humans outnumbered by about a zillion to five.  But, what really stole the show was Nemesis, portrayed by the hulking 6-foot-7 Matthew G. Taylor.  Taylor really lended his performance to Nemesis in this movie, and personally, that is what I felt made this movie worth watching.  Nemesis was just plain cool to watch, and any oversized mutant zombie/human/cyborg decked out in a leather trench-coat-like battle suit with a massive rail gun and an enormous rocket launcher is always fun to watch kick some ass.

All in all, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not fail to deliver the chills, thrills, and cheap laughs that horror/action fans today have come to expect.  It even made by heart race a few times.  Saw it and theaters and bought the DVD, and still enjoy it.",4.0
"""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is to be recommended to those who enjoy good action films. The movie has some breathtaking action and fight sequences that are nearly non-stop (Along with the unnecessary blood and gore, which seriously detracts from the film). The best thing about the film is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory. They can look incredible and kick serious behind at the same time. Their beauty and guts give the film a great boost! Fans of films like ""Aliens"" and the ""Terminator"" trilogy will truly enjoy this one, while others may be turned off by the graphic violence. Whatever your view, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a non-stop action epic that is sure to entertain. Grade: B+",4.0
"I liked this movie. I'm a big Pat Conroy fan Nick Nolte a former college football player was exactly the way I imagined Pat Conroy would be his accent, his southern charm, athletic good looks.

The action and suspense is incredible! There were a few times I actually caught myself holding my breath as they made there way through the hive in the first one. The actors all reallly went full throttle with this one. The dialogue, although a little bland at times, feels really genuine coming from the actors.

"Let me start out by saying the only reason I watched this film is because of Milla Jovovich. (Alice) Period. Ever since I seen her in ""The Fifth Element"" she is now on my must see list. Brains, brawn and beauty are her traits that cannot be matched. But now that I see Sienna Guillory (Jill Valentine) I might have to rethink my reasoning.

""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" continues on the path of the popular video game genre. This film is the second in the series of Resident Evils. The always-curious Umbrella Corporation must open the Hive! Of course this leads to unleashing the T-virus again. Raccoon City is built above the Hive, so the virus spreads faster than oil in water. The Umbrella Corporation cannot stop the virus so the decision is made to quarantine the city and nuke it. But what a better situation to try out their new prototype fighting machine Nemesis.

  A rouge group of cops and civilians roam the streets. They are looking for a way out of the city. When they cross paths they decide to join forces with Alice. But wait, the inventor of the T-virus is looking for his daughter. He strikes up a deal with Alice for their freedom if they can find his daughter. This action packed film takes you on a roller coaster ride through the streets of Raccoon City. All hell breaks out killing zombies and devil dogs. If you liked the first Resident Evil film then this film will not disappoint.",4.0
"The R rating explanation at the beginning of the movie says it all:  ""Rated R for non-stop violence.""  They got that right.  It is easy to see the PS2 video game elements in this movie.  It flows very well and I personally enjoyed this sequel more than the original.  The addition of Jill Valentine to the mix was an inspiration.  To tell you the truth, she's hotter than Milla.

In this episode, the contagion has broken out in Raccoon City and the population immediately falls victim.  Umbrella Corp isolates the city and ultimately unleashes Alice, who has become a project in and of herself since the last outing.  Umbrella takes advantage of the situation and unleashes Nemesis into the city for a trial run.  Ultimately, he is pitted against Alice.  There is a surprise at the outcome of that match.

Meanwhile, Dr. Ashby wants Alice and company to locate his daughter who was in the process of being evacuated when hell broke lose.  In exchange, he promises to get them safely out of the Raccoon City.

There is a lot more characterization here than in many horror films.  RE is very imaginative and the movie makes use of the rich history created by the game.  Good entertainment for the horror fan.",4.0
"If you watch the movie without ever having read the book, you will be fine.  It is a well-written, well-acted production.  If you've read the book, you will be a bit disappointed in all that had to be left out.

I realize that when making a movie out of a book, it is not possible to leave everything in the movie...mainly due to time constraints.  However, when key points/characters in the book are downplayed or changed in the movie, it takes something away from the story.

This is definitely worth watching, but read the book as well.",4.0
so I ordered it. I had read the book and have seen the movie when originally released. It was a nice rainy afternoon movie and I was glad to experience it again.

"Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez

Ok that's most of it.

But this film does have the best feel of a movie adapted from a video game. The framing of the story as it progresses using 3D computer animations to show where the various characters are in ""The Hive"", plus the point-of-view (a la ""Preditor"") shots that the central computer ""Red Queen"" sees, give a real gaming ""techno"" gloss to the proceedings.

The music score by Marylin Manson works great. I detest that guy's personna, but I am forced to give him credit here. He did make me laugh once when he said in an interview that at a multi-artist gig he felt he had succeeded if at least he made a few Alannis Morriset fans throw up.

Anyway, Resident Evil is a great techno-thriller-zombie combo.

"My family recently moved to Beaufort, SC, where this movie is set, and I wanted to see the location scenes.  I had also read the book and wanted to see how closely the movie matched the book.  Great settings and acting.  However, the language and story line is not for young children, obviously according to the rating.  Not exactly like the book, but few movies are.

"I watched the third (and hopefully final) installment of the Resident Evil series last night (Resident Evil:Apocalypse).

 You should see it if you want to see the most expensive (tens of

millions) and well done violent zombie destruction - huge monsters with

rocket launchers- exploding helicopter machine gun violence - fashion

models with dual machine guns - even a good nuclear explosion - ever put

in a movie. In addition, all the heros are really fashion models

(really, they are.). There is also no dialogue. Really. Not even a

little. Just screaming, barking of orders and commands to ""LAUNCH!!!"".

 The best part about the movie is that the plot is so horribly

unbelievable it borders on comically insane. Characters that were

formerly captured and imprisoned suddenly show up fully armored, healed

and ready to save the day. The story is not even cohesive in any manner,

and is so absurdly indigestible as to be insulting. Suspension of belief

doesn't even begin to cut it and at some points in the movie I was

forced to yell ""OH COME ON!!"" in disgust. Deus Ex Machina literally

rains down from the sky like a hurricane. It was clearly written by a 12

year old, and a poorly educated one at that.

 But the explosions are great. Especially the nuke. Highly

recommended. A+++++",4.0
"I was kept very entertained throughout the entire movie, I hope there is a sequel (from the ending it looks as though they have planned for one).  I thought the first RE was scarier and perhaps a little more gory than this one, but this is way more packed with action and racing against time type plot with some suspense.  All in all I'm going to buy the DVD, so I liked it enough to watch again and again! And I don't even play the video game...but then again I love sci-fi movies.",4.0
"I can't remember a time when I didn't love Resident Evil.  No other series of video games can even come close to matching the complexity of the story behind RE.  For years, I thought that an RE movie would be truly awesome, and lo and behold, they made one.  Although none of the original characters were involved, I still relished every second of it, and when I heard there was going to be an RE2 movie, I was estatic.

Now, don't get me wrong.  The visuals, the costumes, the characters, the fighting...all are truly awesome in the movie.  There are plenty of surprises, lots of zombies, and even some comic relief.  All in all, the movie itself was quite well done. My issue is with the plot itself.

As all of you hardcore RE fans know, 'Nemesis' is the title, and the subject, of the 3rd RE game.  The second RE game does deal with the scientist's missing daughter, and with a reporter, but the similarity ends there. RE2 (the videogame) follows Leon's and Claire's seperate stories as they try to escape the city: Claire tries to rescue the scientist's daughter, and Leon and the reporter are looking for the G-virus, the new and updated version of the T-virus. Also, the second game brings in more enemies and all kinds of things that would have made for an excellent movie.

I'm thrilled that a third movie is being made, and I hope it follows RE:Code Veronica a little more closely than ""Apocalypse"" followed RE2.  ""Apocalypse"" is still an awesome movie, but fans, be ye warned: the plot might make you a bit angry.",4.0

"This review is for the video version I taped from cable some years ago. I won't go into all that much detail about the movie save to say that it hit the spot for me. I cared for the characters and I felt for their terrible situations. Susan Lowenstein (Played By The Great Barbra Streisand) saves Tom Wingo and by the end of the movie the two are able to return to their troubled, yet bearable lives.

While the book no doubt is fuller and even better, I feel the movie more than held its own (Granted, I Have Yet To Read The Book). I loved the supporting characters like George Carlin and Gould, the real-life son of Barbara Streisand. Streisand was incredible! She showed that she can indeed direct a top tier movie with a top tier cast. I only wish that they had made a cinematic sequal (Like They Did For Godfather & Jurassic Park) because I wanted to know what happens to the characters 10 & 20 years later. What are Tom Wingo's daughters like in the 21st century?

See this movie on DVD and I'm certain most people will like it. I did.

"People, if you want fleshed out characters and other cinematic niceties, why on earth would you even watch a movie like this?  It's meant to be an adrenaline rush, a cavalcade of fights and wow special effects.  Who cares about Alice's past?  We get enough from the first movie to fill us in.  This movie delivers what you should expect from this kind of moviemaking.  Milla Jovovich kicks butt in this one, which I think overall is better than the original, which seemed to be nothing more than an extended video game.  This time around we get Alice paired up with the likes of Mike Epps, Oded Fehr, Sienna Guillory and others.  Thomas Krestchmann who was so good in THE PIANIST makes an interesting villain.  There's lots of explosive action and twists and turns.  Its dark ending squeals for a third installment.  So relax enjoy this movie's mindlessness and appreciate the craft that was necessary to pull it off so nicely.",4.0
"Paul Anderson to me is a guy movie director: he doesn't make 3 hour long character studies or big period pieces, he just wants to have 90 minutes to show people kicking ass and blowing s*** up. Story may be very one dimensional, as are its characters, and dialogue may be hokey, but if I turned off my brain, I actually could enjoy this.

Resident Evil the first film was essentially a prequel to the first Resident Evil game which took place in the Spencer mansion. The movie was written to provide a prologue to the game even though there's Resident Evil Zero but oh well.

After the events of the first film, Alice, having woken up from some experiments done to her, she awakes to find Raccoon City looking decimated(kind of like RE2 and 3). Umbrella wants to know what happened in the Hive so they open it's huge doors, bad idea. The ""zombies""(they're not called that in the films) attack the scientists and start to overrun the city. The city people then go to the city's only exit, but someone contracts the virus and turns into one of them. Umbrella decides that it's too dangerous to have the virus this close so they do the next best thing to get rid of it: nuke the city. What follows is a group of people trying to escape without getting infected or killed and rescuing the T-Virus creator's daughter.

The plot is basically Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. There's no mention of William Birkin, Leon, or Claire. It does have Carlos Olivera and Jill Valentine from RE3(the latter also being in the first game). Not an important thing but Jill is HOT. Oded Fehr plays Carlos with a badassness and Milla Jovovich is quite capable in the movie-only character Alice. The big creature is the Nemesis, who transformed from Matt from the first movie. He looks like the game's character and has a rocket launcher and mini-gun.

Instead of Paul directing the sequel, the reins are given to Alexander Witt, a long-time second unit director but first time head director. He sometimes has a tendency to have the fast editing syndrome that plagues a director like Michael Bay with fast shots. This makes the fight with Alice and the Nemesis kind of weird too watch cause he's so damn slow yet it's shot like he's going Bruce Lee on her.

They're making a 3rd one with Paul returning as director. Seeing as how Resident Evil 4 just very recently came out, I'm wondering how it'll have its plot turn out. And here's to having Claire, Chris, Ada and especially Rebecca in the next film. But as for this one, give it a shot since it won't do anything bad and may enjoy it(except if you think the movie sucks).",4.0
I saw this movie years ago and really enjoyed it. Then a couple of weeks ago I read the book and couldn't believe all the stories that were packed into that book so I wanted to see the movie again. There is no possible way to squeeze all of that book into a movie. It would have to be a mini-series. All in all though the movie was as good as it could have been I think. Definitely worth watching.,4.0
"I haven't read the book, so my review is based solely on the movie.
I avoided watching it for a long time because I had read so many conflicting reviews. I now realize that every negative review I read has one or both of the following in common: The reviewer hates Barbra Streisand, or the reviewer thinks that, if the movie doesn't follow the book exactly, the movie is bad. Occasionally, someone will mention something else, such as a dislike of Nick Nolte or of George Carlin, but most of the negative reviews are based in those first two biases.

Fortunately, I admire Ms. Streisand, and I understand that a movie must, by its very nature, differ from the book it is based on. In some cases (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Fidelity/dp/B00003CXGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Fidelity</a>, for example--wonderful movie, terrible book), the movie is better.

In this case, the author of The Prince of Tides co-wrote the script, so he had every opportunity to make sure that the story he was telling was true to his book, even if it wasn't a blow-by-blow exact replica.

I am so glad I saw this movie. I feel as though my life is enriched because of it. From the opening moments, I knew I was in very capable hands. The acting, directing, photography, dialog--everything in this movie is among the best there is. There is not one false step in this movie.

A lot is said in finely nuanced facial expressions and through body language--the kind of acting that is a notch above ordinary fare. Some of the topics dealt with are quite intense, and yet somehow Barbra Streisand as a director manages to handle them deftly, neither overdramatizing them nor underplaying their significance. This movie deserved every Academy nomination it got, plus one for director, and should have won far more than it did. Kudos and many thanks to Barbra Streisand and Nick Nolte for this gem.",4.0
"I have not read Pat Conroy's book but I plan to.  You will note that he wrote this screen play.  This movie was quite intense.  I did have a problem with the psychiatrist (Barbara) sleeping with her patient.  Barbra's wardrobe would have been professional, had the skirts not been short. I also had some problems with the way Nick Nolte's character was played.  I lived in South Carolina for 20 years and found many of Nick's traits to be outlandish and not typical of a southern man.  Yet, Tom Wingo (played by Nick) wasn't just playing a southern man; he was playing a severely traumatized man.

I gave this movie a 4 star rating because I was awestruck by the way in which Barbra Streisand played various facets of the psychiatrist role - cool and professional at the beginning, tough as nails to protect the life of her suicidal patient, quiet and analytical with Tom, asking the right questions, putting the pieces together (Savannah's ""splinter that festers"") and, finally, showing so much compassion.  The scene where she held Tom when he cried was priceless. In this fantasy world, Barbra held the person who was hurting.  People who hurt that badly need to be held.  This probably doesn't happen a great deal in real life because of professional boundary concerns or sexual harrassment worries.  There are many Barbra Streisand movies I have not seen, but her acting in this movie showed so much versatility.  I don't think any another actress could have portrayed love, compassion, sorrow, and loss with such intensity.",4.0
"This film is good but overdone. It could've had a simpler plot and it would've been stronger.

Nevertheless, its worth watching...",4.0
"It almost seems a prerequisite now for certain movies to spawn all kinds of aftermarket merchandising, specifically video games (usually sucky ones at that).  But to make a feature length film based on source material taken from a video game?  Seems poor prospect (who remembers 1993's Super Mario Bros?  Or how about 1994's Street Fighter?  Man, those were some awful times), but then again I come from a time when video games were pretty simplistic, and had little or no story.  Nowadays, the technology has allowed for extremely well developed storylines within games, and the likelihood of seeing the transition from game consoles to the big screen becoming more and more common.  I mean, look at it like this, if a game sold how many million copies, you pretty much already have a large fan base more than eager to watch a film based on said game.  A built in audience...how can you go wrong?  Well, if you deviate from the storyline, or screw up various elements or characters, you may end up with a fairly rabid pack of angry fans looking for blood...Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004), sequel to 2002's Resident Evil film, was written by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon, AVP: Alien Vs. Predator), and directed by Alexander Witt, a man who has a ton of 2nd director (this is the guy responsible for filming shots of less importance, such as inserts, crowds, scenery, etc.) credits to his name, but makes his directing debut here.  Returning in her role as Alice from the first film is Milla Jovovich (as far as I can tell, she was the only one who made it into the sequel).  Also appearing is Sienna Guillory (Love Actually), Oded Fehr (Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, The Mummy), Mike Epps (Friday After Next, The Fighting Temptations), and Matthew G. Taylor (Gothika, Detroit Rock City) as Nemesis.

The film begins with Umbrella agents in full biohazard gear opening up The Hive, with predictable results (The Hive was a ginormaous, underground research facility that was sealed due to contamination in the first film).  This leads to the T-virus (the contaminate that has the ability to re-animate the dead) to spread into Raccoon City, forcing the Umbrella Corporation, owner of not only The Hive but the city as well, to quarantine the city, sealing many uninfected residents with all kinds of walking dead, many vicious mutations seen in the first film, along with a few new ones.  Alice, joined by a small band of survivors, now trapped inside the city, makes a deal to retrieve the young daughter of a scientist in return for safe passage out of the quarantined area.  Only problem is, besides the legion of hungry undead roaming the streets and hideous, nasty, bitey creatures on the prowl, the Umbrella Corporation has ideas of their own, seeing the situation as a perfect opportunity to test out their latest bio-weapon, Nemesis.  Oh yeah, there's also plans to nuke the city...time is running out (along with their ammunition), for the small group, but they do have an edge, namely, in Alice, as she is more than she appears...

Now you don't have to see the original to enjoy this sequel, as the makers of the film provide a certain amount of back-story at the beginning, but you probably should to get the full flavor.  I really wasn't expecting a lot seeing as how this was a sequel and we all know sequels rarely meet the level of the original that spawned said sequel, so I was pleasantly surprised when the film turned out to be pretty good, well, good in the sense that it's a movie based off of a video game.  And that's what I think people should keep in mind, especially those disappointed at the lack of substance within the plot.  A majority of the plot actually extends from the first, setting things up for this picture, which is heavy on action, light on nearly everything else.  I thought the actors did a pretty good job (that Sienna Guillory is one fine, hotsy totsy momma, playing the role of Jill Valentine).  I especially enjoyed Mike Epps as the urban civilian caught up in forces way beyond his control, relating some truly funny lines in a completely realistic manner.  I normally despise comic relief characters, as they're often played so ridiculously over the top that they distract more than anything else, but that wasn't the case here.  The one aspect I disliked the most about the film was the excessive, epileptic, herky jerky camera work and quick cutting, meant to heighten the tension during the more action filled scenes, but it just served to annoy the heck out of me.  This type of direction can be effective in smaller doses, but it's used too often here, and may cause some viewers to reach for the Dramamine.  Also, I thought it odd that every time the undead were shown, their shots were often marred by jittery cutting, as if to highlight something (I don't know what), but it made me wonder if it was done to draw away from the detail, or lack of, concerning the make up of the characters.  There were quite a few characters in this film, each seeming to have their own, little storyline going, but then they're unified nicely once their goals become shared.  The special effects are very slick, and the action rarely slows down, and there's lots of guns, gunfire, explosions, things getting blown up (blown up real good).  I thought the film a little short (it does list a 94 minute running time), but the ending sets up for a possible sequel.

I won't bother listing all the special features as Amazon details them nicely, but I will say the picture and audio were excellent.  This is a two disc set, the first DVD containing the film (both widescreen and full screen format), along with some special features, with the 2nd containing the bulk of the extras. 3  stars

"Barbra Streisand's second film as a director is also her most successful, most well-liked, and by far her most oscar-nominated.  It isn't hard to see why, as the film tackles the near-universal topic of dysfunctional family life, and how it ends up effecting other families as time goes on.

At the same time, this film has many controversies and flaws to it.  Many fans of the novel condemn Streisand for totally changing the story around, and attempting to make the movie more about her character, Susan, when originally her role was not quite as central.  It is also (agreeably) criticized for implying that revealing a secret repressed with just magically make everything better.

As far as flaws go, most of them come in the form of bad casting and unrealistic performances.  The biggest miscast was Barbra's son, Jason Gould, as her son, wannabe football player Bernard.  He comes across far too dorky and does not have the proper body to be completely believable as a football player.  The other major problem is Barbra Streisand's performance as a psychiatrist.  It has to be said that the way she acts is extremely unprofessional behavior for a psychiatrist.  Real psychiatrists don't get confrontational, talk to their patients like they are stupid, yell at their patients, and certainly do not become friends with/date their patients.  But you could argue that that is just something you need to suspend disbelief on.

Those flaws mentioned and ranted about, there are plenty of strong aspects to the movie.  For one, the photography is just stunning, with some stunning scenery, sunsets, and even Barbra Streisand herself, looking very lovely, and difficult to take your eyes off of.  Another strong point, perhaps what saves this production, are the fantastic performances.  Nick Nolte, Kate Nelligan, and Blythe Danner especially give truly raw performances as complex, emotional, and not always likeable people.  But nobody, not even Streisand and her son, gives a terrible performance.  Finally, the storyline is very involving and heartbreaking, and even the romance between Nolte and Streisand, while a little more prevalent than it should be, is very touching.

Though nominated for many Academy Awards, it isn't hard to see why it won zero.  When watched today, it has the feeling of a Lifetime tv-movie, and I'm sure the Academy felt that what could have been a raw, educational look at psychiatry and coming to terms with your past was made into not much more than a soap opera.  But still, this is a very engrossing film that, love it or hate it, will stick with you.  Not destined to be a classic, but good nonetheless.",4.0
"I have seen this film a number of times, realized I wanted a copy to keep. While Pat Conroy's books are too often ""over-written,"" including PRINCE OF TIDES -- I still love this particular book, and the script for the film -- brava to Streisand. And Nick Nolte is marvelous!",4.0
"Not too bad for the most part, though the ending is pretty unconvincing. The cynical, distant Nick Nolte goes to NYC after his twin sister (played by Melinda Dillon) there tries to commit suicide. He begins seeing her psychiatrist (Barbra Streisand) and through flashbacks we learn about the demons of his family's past - all of which he's learned to suppress his whole life. Conveniently Nolte's wife (Blythe Danner) takes up with another man while Nolte is falling in love with Streisand; at the end he returns to his wife though he still loves Streisand. Nolte is excellent in his role, and as is often the case when he's on screen, his persona dominates every scene he's in; Streisand is fairly bland in comparison. The movie begins to show its weaknesses after Nolte and Streisand fall in love: where the movie should be exploring their love and ""obligations"" in a hard, meaningful way, it only goes soft and paisley romantic. Why Nolte goes back to his wife, why she even wants him back, is hardly touched on; instead we get the throwaway lines, ""You love her more,"" says Streisand; ""No,"" replies Nolte, ""just longer."" Not a whole lot of substance there.",4.0
"As far as shlocky zombie films go the R.E. franchise is my favorite. I did perfer the first one.
As a ""Torontoian"" I have to say it was fun to watch if a bit hard to suspend disbelief I found that I had to keep telling myself ""that's not Toronto City all It's Racoon City City Hall... or that's not the CN Tower in the background, pretend it's not there.""
I think that dispite what the reviewer said the visuals were well done, I enjoyed the fact that ""real"" effects were used where it was not ablsoutly nessisary to use CGI ie. Milla Jovovich's (Alice) stunt double running down the side of city hall and Milla doing the last 60 feet herself, this was all done in real time and not on a blue/green screen nor CG.
If you expect Citizen Kane from this movie then perhaps you aught to rethink you choice in Genre. It's a *Bleeping* horror/action/sci-fi flick for goodnessakes not high art.
The DVD special features are fantastic also 3 comentaries, the one with Milla, Sienna, and Oded kept me chuckling Milla has a fantastic sense of humor.

"First of All, I've never played any of the games except the first one, and that kicked my ass... I am one of those weak little players that gravitates toward RPG or tetris games... <so sad...>.

I've heard that the movie was better for people who haven't played the games, and must agree. I was told more about the storyline (What, I'm not telling you- What, are you too lazy to play the game?!) and it was quite different with other characters and whatnot.

Overall the visuals were decent and it ""didn't get boring"" at all. The only thing I didn't like was the final fight scene where the cameras were switching back and forth and it was a bit disorienting.

Nemesis was wonderfully portrayed but should of had a bigger part. His rocket launcher was also very entertaining...

THE FILM WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE, BEST ACTOR FOR NICK NOTLE AND BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS FOR KATE NELIGAN - UNFORTUNATELY, MISS STRIESAND WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR BEST DIRECTOR, WHICH SURELY IS A MISFORTUNE BECAUSE IT WAS SHE WHO COAXED THESE MARVELOUS PERFORMANCES FROM THESE ACTORS.  WATCH IT AND LOVE IT.",4.0
"In only her second directorial effort (after ""Yentl""), Barbra Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis.  She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well.

The 1991 movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. Granted, she does make herself rather beatific even in her high skirts and flimsy blouses, but such expectations come with Streisand as she basically plays Tom's savior. At the same time, it is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay. Melinda Dillon has little to do as Savannah except look traumatized, which she does well. And in a not too subtle display of nepotism, Streisand's son, Jason Gould, sullenly plays the doctor's son, a musician-in-training who is coached on the finer points of football by Tom.

The movie is not without flaws. First, there is a critical scene where Tom confesses to Lowenstein (as Tom calls her) what exactly happened in his childhood that none of the Wingos have been willing or able to share with anyone else.  Because of Streisand's effective juxtaposition of the long-ago violent crime with the present-day therapy session and Nolte's superb work, this is an especially powerful sequence. It feels climactic in nature given the depth of the catharsis we have been presented at that point, but the problem is that it comes about 45 minutes before the end of the movie. It is around this point that the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein following a tense, pretentious dinner party with Jeroen Krabbe holding court as her psychologically abusive husband, a world renowned violinist out to humiliate Tom. Consequently, we are given a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Luckily the film recovers toward the end before any serious damage is done. Special mention should be made of the beautiful cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt, who perfectly captures the burnished aura of the lowlands of South Carolina, and the symphonic, often swooning score by James Newton-Howard. It's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together.",4.0
"This movie is one of Barbra Streisand's best, plotwise, direction wise, and most importantly acting wise. Her and Nick Nolte's acting is great, making this a very lovely movie in every single way. Except adaptation-wise.
I do respect the fact that if the book were to be totally copied it would have been endless, but still, there are many points in plot and dialogue that are a lot stronger than that of the movie
Still this movie is wonderfull, and even though it does not give the book its total value, it is one to see.",4.0
"Many novels are difficult to project on the ""silver screen"" from the printed page. For those who have read the book, I think it is true of Conroy's, The Prince of Tides. The truth is that you just can not build the story lines because of time restraints, etc in a movie that you can throught the printed page. I agree with several other reviewers that if this work were a miniseries it may have been able to follow several very good story lines from the book that were left out or only made mention of in the movie.(I think it would have been a great series).
All that being said, I still think it is movie worth the time of watching. It is touching. It is funny, It will pull you into the lives and loves of the main characters. The story line is true to the novel, although it is not as full as I would have liked. I thought that Nick Nolte was wonderful as Tom Wingo the story teller of the book. He captures well the southern fire of the lead character. In my estimation, this is the best acting job that I have seen Barbara Streisand do. She was passionate and compelling. The supporting cast was also very good. The movie contrast well the power of love's ability to build up and to tear down. A good movie to watch by yourself or with your family.",4.0
"Dont get me wrong, I loved this movie. There were just a few details that I didn't exactly like. Well not a few, there was 2 details. 1 - There was too big a portion of time missing when Jill and Carlos rescued Alice after she got like ""revamped"" with the mind powers and what not. There was like this gap thats left for our imagination to fill. the 2nd thing I didn't really like though it wasn't that big of a deal was the look of the Nemesis. I found it had a very corny look to it - like it didn't look real enough I found. All in all - damn good movie.",4.0
"The events of ""The Prince of Tides"" play out in such a fashion that one tends to forget how soapy and melodramatic they really are. What begins as one man's emotional awakening to the events of his past in an attempt to help his sibling generates into a run-of-the-mill romance easily found in the pages of any Harlequin novel. And yet, through acting zeal and its abidance by the rules of tearjerkers, this film actually pays off in a weird sort of way.
At the center of the story is Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte), a middle-aged Southern football coach with a wife and three children. The film's calendar art opening sequence serves to show his childhood in an appealing light, yet his adult life is anything but enjoyable. His wife is estranged from him, put off by his humorous approach to serious situations and by his unwillingness to discuss the pitfalls of their marriage. When his mother, whom he clearly despises, informs him that his sister Savannah has attempted suicide again, he heads off to New York City, where he will meet with her psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand), to help her unlock the pain in Savannah's subconscious.
The story's change in setting and story is the decision point for audiences, who can either accept the drama and enjoy it, or groan at the segue from the suicide angle to a romance storyline. Once in New York, Tom begins revealing events from his childhood to Lowenstein, who listens with a caring ear, perhaps more caring than the ethics of her career would allow. As their relationship begins to deepen, Tom reveals more to her, including a carefully guarded secret known only by his two siblings and mother, as well as his feelings for her.
A heads up of what to watch for in this movie: its well-structured plot, which, despite its melodramatic subject matter, weaves a fine web of love, hate, revelation, and the courage to overcome hardships. The romance that eventually takes flight between Tom and Lowenstein is run-of-the-mill, from their shared family discord to their realization that it cannot last forever. Even still, these aspects are given some vitality: Tom agrees to help her son become a football player, and later antagonizes her haughty celebrity husband at a dinner party in one of the film's most memorable scenes. The bittersweet ending has been done countless times before, but it's helped by the fact that we have come to like the characters and can appreciate, if not comprehend, their situation.
Even more interesting is the way in which Tom slowly begins to break down. As his resolve begins to fade, he breaks into new emotional ground, letting go of the hardships he has been holding inside all of his life. His family life is revealed in gritty detail, all of which provides reason for the attitudes he holds to presently. And when it comes time for him to break down and face his torments, we believe in his emotion because of his experiences. This is the kind of character we can come to care about deeply, through his many realizations and reawakenings.
Kudos to the cast, which is stellar all around. Nolte shines as Tom, giving a powerful performance full of convincing emotion and forceful dialogue. Streisand's role as Lowenstein is good enough, better than most give her credit for; she gets the job done in front of and behind the camera with serviceable results. Add to this a supporting cast that includes Blythe Danner as Tom's wife, Kate Nelligan as his mother, and Streisand's own son, Jason Gould, as her character's son, and you have a truly becoming cast that adds zest and freshness to the script.
Some may not think that this is enough for ""The Prince of Tides"" to work, but in a way, it is. With a story that jumps from place to place, much like that of a soap opera, the cast is able to chew on the material with terrific gusto, making the changes of pace, setting and story easier to stomach. It's not a completely original piece, yet there is an appeal in its cliched romance, and a strong depth of feeling behind its characterization and human story. On this, the movie is a success.",4.0
"I loved the book, I loved the film. I think Streisand beautifully captured the essence of the book's emotional intensity. For me,the scenery in the film was exactly as I'd imagined it based on Pat Conroy's descriptions. HOWEVER, having waited eagerly for the DVD, was very disappointed to find no special features of note (unless you call trailers and filmographies 'special features'). I know I've seen a 'Making of...' somewhere before and assumed that it would be included in this addition. As thrilled as I am to own this movie on DVD, don't buy this thinking there are extras. You'll be disappointed.",4.0
"This is a dramatic, moving movie with great characters and wonderful plot development. Barbara Streisand plays a wonderfully real psychologist who seeks to help Nick Nolte's character deal with his troubled past in order  to help his future. It is very moving and will leave you thinking about it  a week later.",4.0
"Picking up the dvd today I had some anticipation that this would be just as good as the first one. I saw this in the theater and it enjoyed it then. This is better than the first movie, which I thought was good. Good story, good acting, good action!

If you are a fan or at least familiar with the video game storyline you will easily pick up the references in this chapter. The first movie was a prequel and this one is taken directly from the source. Watch carefully and you will get them all.

As a movie, this is your big action popcorn movie with some sci-fi in it. If you are a zombie fan you will find there are some tense moments but nothing like Dawn Of The Dead. It only lacks in the tension put out by the game where you can't see beyond a closed door. Other than this setback it is action packed and will keep you going!

Jill valentine makes her first appearance straight from the Resident Evil 2 finally. She adds a nice compliment to alice from the first film. The subplot of Umbrella starts to also come full circle. Very Good! Go rent it or buy it!",4.0
"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS FILM AND I'M A MASTER AT THE GAMES SO IT WAS FUN TO HAVE MORE GAME ELEMENTS IN THE MOVIE. HOWEVER THE DVD BOASTS OVER 6 HOURS OF EXTRAS WHICH IS'NT TRUE. THERE ARE 3 COMMENTARIES AND MAYBE ABOUT AN HOUR OF BEHIND THE SCENES FEATURETTES. FOR ME, A BIG SELL OF A DVD IS WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS A COMMENTARY, THIS ONE HAS 3, BUT I DON'T THINK HAVING 3 FEATURE-LENGTH COMMENTARIES  JUSTIFIES THE ADVERTISEMENT OF MORE THAN 6 HOURS OF BONUSES. I FEEL THAT COMMENTARIES ARE MANDATORY AND THE SPECIAL FEATURES SHOULD BE ALL THE GOOD STUFF WE SEE BEHIND THE SCENES. A GREAT DVD TO HAVE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE GAMES, BUT A BIG LET DOWN AS FAR AS THE SPECIAL FEATURES GO.

  --- JULIEN RAFAEL",4.0
"First, I haven't picked up the DVD yet so I can't comment on the extras, although from reading the product description, it looks like it's gonna be really cool. I did see it in the theaters twice, so my comments will focus on the movie itself.
I was a big fan of the first movie, even though the storyline and the characters didn't have anything to do with the game series. The second one not only has all the elements that made the first one so cool, but now it actually takes place in Raccoon City. So, now you get a real perspective of what the game might actually look like in real life. Nemesis is just bad ass, definitely the coolest part of the movie. Milla Jovovich spent some long hours in the gym, because she is seriously toned. Sienna Guillory (Jill) is real nice on the eyes too, with her hourglass figure and tight fitting clothes. There's more Zombie creatures, too. The dogs are back, and while there was one licker in the first one, now there's a bunch of them. There's a lot more zombie people, too. Of course, also there's Nemesis. The action is pretty awesome too. You know how in the trailer they show Alice running down the side of the building? She also manages to kill four or so guards at the bottom without skipping a beat. There's also more humor in the movie. Mike Epps plays the wisecracking token black guy (as much as I hate stereotypes, that really is his character) and manages to pull off the bulk of the comic relief. I was very pleased with this sequel.
Now, I would have loved to give this movie 5 stars but I just couldn't, for 2 reasons. First, I was disappointed to hear that Paul Anderson wouldn't be back in the director's chair for this one. I'm a huge fan of Mortal Kombat and AVP. It was hard for me to picture the movie done by anyone else. Nonetheless, I gave it a good chance. My synopsis is, this director is just not as good. During the fighting scenes, the cameras were shaking like someone was making a home movie. Very annoying. Plus, it was hard to see the details on the zombies because the cameras were blurred when they were being shown. Not very high quality.
Second reason is what happens with Nemesis at the end. Alice has a final fight with him and, well I don't want to give it away but the way they wrote it was very cheesy and sappy.
Overall, this one is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the games, or a fan of the first movie, or even just a fan of horror/action flicks in general.
By the way, there will be a third movie! It's going to be called Resident Evil: Afterlife and prodution is scheduled to start in 2005. I don't know about you guys, but I'm really psyched.",4.0
"Like one person said on here, the movie is great, but it seemed to be missing something. I wished the film focused more on the lickers, zombies, and Nemesis. Although it did a good job covering two of the three but it still seemed like the movie still could have done better. Was there a tighter budget compared to the first film?

Anyways, I thought the story was about average for a film of this type. Nothing that will really surprise anyone.

As for the characters, Milla Jovovich's character does steal the show but as we quickly learn, she is kind of the center of the movie. The acting though is just great! Definitely worth mentioning.

Overall Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a great film. But it just seemed like something was missing. The movie could have been longer and focused more on the zombies, lickers, and Nemesis. But for what was given on the silver screen, it is satisfying. The DVD has a plethora of extras on it as well so you shouldn't get bored with it. Definitely worth a look if you are a fan of this kind of stuff.",4.0
"Not oftern does a sequel surpass the first.  This IS one exception.  More characters from the game appear in this one, and there is a lot of action.  It's non-stop, a rollercoaster ride into hell and back.

Cast performs well.  The critters are great.  In a year full of good zombie films, this one stands out on its own.  The plot is more complex than the first.  Project nemesis is in full throttle and our heroes now have a new enemy to battle as well as the flesh eating ghouls.  For horror fans, lotsa blood and goo.  For actioneers it's even better.  lottsa fun.  Eat popcorn, press play, enjoy.",4.0
"Ok, what horror movie has a good script??? This is one of the ""good"" horror game-based movies I've seen, yet this falls short on revealing game antics. For those that have fans of the game for more than 6 years, will be dissapointed, yet will respect it for being Resident Evil, itself. The game series is ""perfect"" compared to the movie. This fairly deserves a 3.8/5. Recommended for any Resident Evil fan.",4.0
"I enjoyed this movie from beginning to I think the end or was it the beginning.  This film was terrific and I loved it except the end was not really the end, instead it positioned itself as chapeter two of ?? don't know how many more, but I hope it will be released soon. Don't like paying for a whole movie and finding out it is not the whole one. The Movie was done well, and lots of the same and more from the fist flick.  Yep, it is worth buying.",4.0
"I enjoyed the first resident evil film because of the action but where was the gore from the games. The zombies didn't seem that hungry to me. They were supposed to be ravanous flesh hungry zombies but that wasn't what you see. For instance take the bloke who gets pinned down in the lift. You see loads of zombies clawing at him but when he becomes a zombie later, he has some lacerations and a few chunks out of him. Does that seem like ravanous zombies to you? If that had been a george romero film, you can guarantee that there wouldn't have been anything left of him to get back up. Except maybe a skeleton. Where as Resident Evil Apocalypse was better than i thought it would be. The blood flowed much more in this film. The zombies took more detailed chunks out of their victims (if you were pinned down in this film, there would be nothing left of you as these zombies really are hungry. Check out the poor woman who gets it in the school. You don't see her again. Gee i wonder why?) and the lickers were better too and it was scary during parts too. The intro to jill was cool. You don't need an intro to her character in this film as you already know her from the games and the game that she used that dress in was Resident Evil Nemesis (which i believe this film was loosely based on)where she popped a zombie's head as soon as she saw it. Alice is better in this film as she can seriously kick ass. Both zombie and nemesis. The intro of the original s.t.a.r.r.s team was good, even though they didn't last very long. The ending was very good too as alice, the zombies and a special character turns against their creators at umbrella. About time they got what was coming to them. Look forward to R.E 3. More blood, more guts and most importantly more glory.",4.0
"Lets just pretend there is no such thing as the first movie, and this is the only one.  This movie had everything, even a little cheesy-ness now and then (not a good thing.) This is the reason why this is 4 stars, not 5.  The zombies were great, Nemesis was great, the lickers made A HUGE improvement from the first (wait, there is no first, remember) and the charcters were all great in their own way.  Check this movie out, the only thing missing is Arnold.",4.0
"I was surprised at just how good this movie was!  I am really glad that they turned it into more of a political and psychological thriller instead of just us having to watch Alice and Co. run around killing mindless zombies.  I really liked the underlying political statements that were made concerning corporations and media control.  This flick is great for those seeking a slightly more ""intellectual"" movie, and for those who simply want to sit back in their stadium seats with some buttered popcorn and have a good time.  I hope the next one will be even better....",4.0
"After eagerly awaiting for the sequel due to the open ending of RESIDENT EVIL, and being teased by realistic ""ad"" trailers I was ready to see Apocalypse.

This movie did not disappoint, in fact I may boldly state it is the best action/horror movie I have yet watched. Mila Jovanavich is again compelling to watch in the lead role as the sole survivor from the first movie. (Well technically she isn't the SOLE survivor, but don't want to provide more spoiler than neccessary to whet Amazonians appetite.

She had already been through hell surviving the HIVE, the awakens to discover the whole of Raccoon City fallen prey to the virus. Quickly she joins a small, determined group of humans who make a deal with an Umbrella scientist to be able to leave the quarantined city in return for rescuing his daughter.

The action in this movie is intense, yet being a Resident Evil movie there are some genuinely creepy scenes as well. Although APOCALYPSE is heavy on action and special effects there are characters here as well including Jill Valentine from the video game.

In fact I barely played Resident Evil so my memory was foggy, but friends confirmed that as the little I remembered led me to suspect this movie stayed really true to the game. One criticism I have heard is that it lacks the story that the first had, to which I reply hey it's a video game adaptation movie not Shakespeare. In other words this movie delivered exactly what I expected and much more, the fact that it was filmed obviously in Toronto, where I grew up was just that much more of a bonus.",4.0
"This movie was great. I DO play video games, so I may be biased, but no completely. This is the only video-game turned-movie that i like. Final Fantasy was not good. Acting was good. Reason for my 4-star rating was because the script could have been done better. I say this because I don't remember hearing or knowing that the main character's name was Alice until the end credits.

By the way in response to  Mr. Robbin's review, he said:

  ""Except for one part, Milla, your no Jackie Chan, so that kick move off the wall, w/o the explanation presented in the second movie, was just uncalled for; a little too over the top.""

I have to disagree because during that scene, at first she doesn't know how she does it, but she remembers the captain telling her (due to amnesia) that she's  highly trained operative to guard the mansion.",4.0
"HOLA soy cubano y hablo espaol.

El filme esta bien ,pero creo que no debieron usar a Jill Valentine pues esta se sale del contesto historico del juego ,o sea, ella en tiempo y espacio no le correspondia estar alli ya que de esta forma no concuerda con la historia de RESIDENT EVIL NEMESIS.",4.0
"This movie is excellent. The critics don't seem to like it much, but most people who have seen it say that it's awesome. If you liked the 1st Resident Evil, you will really enjoy this one. It has a lot more action and Milla Jovovich does a lot more fighting. You see, they did something to her, Alice. She hardly feels human anymore.

The really good thing about this movie is that it does not just focus on mindless zombies. In fact, after the first half of the movie, the zombies have a minimal role. The movie shifts its focus onto the Nemesis project, or Matt from the first movie. And the climatic fight between him and Alice was really cool with Toronto's old city hall as the backdrop. Torontonians will recognize familiar locations throughout the movie and you can even catch a glimpse of the CN Tower if you look closely.

On the downside, the movie does little to explain a lot of things that happen and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks. For instance, we never know why Alice comes crashing through the stained glass window or how she knows what is on the other side. If the Nemesis creature could be mind controlled, then why wasn't Alice. And why were zombies coming out of the ground in the graveyard.

Overall, this is an awesome movie. Great action and great fighting. And an interesting ending that plants the seed for a 3rd movie... I'm thinking about seeing this one again!",4.0
"So yeah, this movie basically has very little to do with the Resident Evil game series we all know and love. Granted, there are zombies. Lots of zombies. And zombie dogs. And there is *a* licker. No tyrants. Boo. But, we can't have everything jammed into one movie, can we?

Basic plot is that the Umbrella underground lab known as ""The Hive"" has had an outbreak of the T-virus, and everyone was killed. Milla Jovovich 's character awakes with no memory of what has happened, and is forced by Umbrella-sent commandos into the Hive to see what went on down there. Chaos ensues.

Milla did a decent bit of acting in this movie. Granted, the outfit was an obvious ploy to get fanboy response, but oh well. Eric Mabius did an excellent job as supporting lead, especially towards the end. (god bless those candid muscle shots) Michelle Rodriguez was also very believable in her performance.

So, if you've got a free afternoon and need some decent entertainment in terms of action, suspense, and zombie-popping fun, go for this flick. It's not like the games, but I guess we'll have to gag and bind Paul Anderson for him to do a *real* Resident Evil film.",4.0
"This movie was far superior to the first one. What bugged me about the first movie was that it had zero to do with the games. However, Apocalypse delivers where the original did not. It has all the action of RE games, as well as some memorable characters from RE3. More importantly, you get to see Raccoon City in all its glory. There were two parts of the movie that bugged me, though. The first was a horrible line of dialogue from Jill Valentine: ""I'm good... but I'm not that good"", refering to Alice's fighting abilities. The combination of sub-par acting on Jill's (I'm not sure who the actress is) behalf and poor writing on Anderson's made it utterly corny, and I felt it took away from the movie. Another low point is a really bad fake accent by Nicolai. He hadn't even enough lines to deserve an accent, so it escapes me why they let the actor (who I didn't buy in the role after seeing him in Titus, anyway) use one so awful it feels like he's really just joking around. Those aside, I still really enjoyed this movie, and if you are a fan of the genre and are willing to set aside realism for the sake of entertainment, I would definately suggest for you this movie.",4.0
"I'll make this short and sweet, This is a very good movie but it should of been beter. The acting was OK of corse the story was great  and the fight seens were ok. THE PROBLEM, The problem with Resident Evil Apocalypse is that the camera views are awful. When you watch a fight seen you want to see the fight at a good angle and on many different angles. The views were so bad it's almost hard to describe them  but think about seeing a fight seen and the whole time the camera's focused on the person's chest the entire fight there's kicking and punching but you can't see much of the kicking or punching. SO GO See the movie if you love the game series or want to know the second part of the story, the movie won't let you down completely but those camera views are gonna start to get to you while watching.",4.0
"I actually enjoyed movie.  It was a pure fun pop corn flick.  I was impressed how they summed up the first movie in a nice way that didn't take long and wasn't corny.  Jill was done extremely well, sense she is big shoes to fill.  Awesome fight scenes hands down, the only bad thing is the fact that some of the moves went by way too fast.  Such as the grave yard scene: even thought there was some awesome kicks, some of it went by way too fast.

The characters were pretty decent.  Jill, Alice, and Carlos kept their parts pretty good, and the new addition of Terri added some ""classic scared citizen"".  However, L.J. was put in there to add some humor to the movie like Rain did in the first, yet I feel added too much black man stereotypical humor.  And Nicholai was a flat out embarrassment to the original Resident Evil 3 game, I mean he was a good person, which kinda flattens any chance of him being cool.

There was some questionable scenes, such as when Terri was told to go to the second floor, why was she seen going down the stairs?  Or like when Alice was able to just look at the man through the camera and killed him, that was very corny, but then again, Alexia from the video game had similar powers, so I guess no need to be super shocked.  Also, the topless zombies, what a horrible way to add ""sex appeal"" to a movie, especially sense they really served no point in the movie.

But other than some minor flaws, it's a perfect Friday night flick if you're looking for a fun action horror movie.",4.0
"After seeing Apocalypse, the story picks up where it left off with Alice leaving Umbrella H.Q. and finds Raccoon City a trashed, urban ghost town! For those who expected the R.E. flicks to be 90% accurate, forgot they're loosely based on the videogames.

As Apocalypse begins, key players from the Umbrella Corp. are no longer a mystery behind their environmental suits as the T-virus spreads. The zombies are out on the loose, eating and infecting people as they go. The Umbrella Corp. enforces a quarantine lockdown when lovely (Sienna Guillory) Jill Valentine arrives. What was lacking from the sequel was the length of time Jill spent at the police station in light of that same scene from RE2 confronting the zombies and trying to figure out where they came from. Less suspense, gore, and blood didn't prevail after the sequel's predessor. But more zombies and more action earned my approval.

Milla Jovovich looks as tough as Xena: Princess Warrior with guns a blazing on a Harley. As for director Paul Anderson, he was supposed to direct this sequel but, fell back on his word and chose to do ""Aliens v.s Predator.""

The most shocking scene was our heroes in the graveyard and the dead reanimated by the T-virus coming out their burial lots in the shades of George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead."" Who was that man in the rubber ""Nemesis"" suit?

Yet Resident Evil has reinvented the zombie genre for a new audience of moviegoers. The purists can say whatever they want to say in retrospect of their zombie films of the 70's. Please remember we are in the year 2004, and today's zombie flicks contain some of our current event themes.",4.0
"I didn't care for the first one. I thought it was too slow. This one however revived the series. As the rating board says on the movie, in fine print under the R rating ""Non stop violence and gore"" need I say more?
It was a very good movie. My only problem is I hate matrix type movies and James bond type of movies, meaning: Impossible feats that not only leave you saying ""yea right"" but also are so outrageous they are laughable at best. Ex: she runs down a building on a rope. I thought that was not only impossible, but way cheesy. Movies need to stay away from the Charlie's angels mentality! You begin to stop taking it seriously when you see too much of this. Another nit-pick I have is the fast camera battle sequences. ITS ANNOYING! we all know the scenes. Where the camera moves so fast all you here is grunts from the battle, and a snippet of gore. Hold the camera still you moron!
Anyway, awesome movie.",4.0
"This movie is awesome!! Much much better than the first. The action gets started right away and hardly stops. Now...if your a fan of the game, your gonna come to realize that this movie has more in common with RE3 than anything else. Anyways... this is the plot:

  We leave off with Alice in the streets of raccoon City...which has been completely destroyed by zombies and the sort due to the Tvirus leaking. However, RE:A picks up a few hours before that happens. Umbrella. the evil corporation behind everything, goes to pick up its high-tech employees. one of which being Dr. Ashford. However, his daughter, also being transported to a safe place, her car gets hit by a truck and we see that she is barely alive. Now here is where things get bad.

  You remember the Hive right? that huge lab underneath Raccoon City? well the good people of Umbrella decided to re-open it thus they get attacked by the zombies in it and the virus spreads out into the city. NOW re go to the conclsion of the first movie. They show Alice wake up and go into the city. meanwhile. another person Jill Valentine, is also trying to escape the city and a few other people join in. some last a few minutes some last awhile until you know that they are bound to die.

  The movie itself features quite a few creatures. Of course, the zombies are back in and they look the same as the first movie but this time they move a little bit faster? also the zombie dogs are back and they actually put up a little bit more fight this time unlike the first movie where like 10 of them get killed with like a clip of bullets. Also, the lickers, yes i said lickerS, make an appearance. These look much better than the totally CGI one of the first movie. The fight scenes move fast but are done well. The character of Jill could have used a little bit more depth but its wasn't bad considering the director was making his debut.

  In closing, they basically have to find the girl cause Dr. Ashford said he could get them out. However, to complicate things, Umbrella decided to send in a little...re-inforcement"" in the form of NEMSIS, a huge walking tank almost complete with a rocket launcher and a helicpoter mini-gun capable of firing 6000 rounds a minute! and he's also immune to almost every type of ammo lol.

  The movie like i said is much better than the first. there's more action, more comedy lol although a little out of place sometimes, the acton is cool, and the movie is a managable Hour and 30min long. If i had to change anythig it would be:

  Perhaps the indepth of jill, the way NEMESIS is ""killed""

  Go see this if your a  fan of the first movie or the games but please don't go in expecting academy award performances this all about guns, actions and death lol",4.0

"RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE begins almost immediately where RESIDENT EVIL ended. The movie gives us a few details surrounding the incidents from the first movie:  Umbrella people opening the Hive which unleashes the zombies infected with the T-virus, Umbrella rounding up their top scientists to evacuate from Raccoon City, what exactly happened to Alice and Matt Addison after they escaped the Hive, etc. Then the fun really begins. The movie jumps around quite a bit as it follows several different characters in several different places scattered throughout the city who don't start meeting up with each other until about half-way through the movie. Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera (heroes from the Resident Evil video games) have major roles in the film, teaming up with Alice and a few other stragglers as they attempt to escape the city before Umbrella nukes the place to kill off the T-virus before it spreads any further.

The movie has a lot of action and even though this is a zombie movie, it's bascically an action/espionage movie with a bunch of zombies running around instead of a simple horror movie. The licker from the first movie has a brief appearance (with some kin), as well as a couple of mutated dogs, and a creature called Nemesis.  The film isn't as gory as the first movie, though there is a lot of violence.  There are also a few unnecessary swears and a shot of a nude Alice in a laboratory.

I enjoyed RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE.  I've never played the video games, but I was surprised by the way the first film was done and I was excited to see this sequel.  In many ways, RE:A is a better film than RE.  My biggest complaint with the movie is that it sets up a third film which makes the movie ten minutes longer than it could have been. But then again, I'm excited to see the third installment and see how everything will come together in the end.",4.0
"It was the most watched trailer from May 2004-July 2004. The first movie was the most critically acclaimed zombie movie for excellent makeup and extreme sucess of a game to movie transition. RE:A has again, showed the audience that the Resident Evil series has great potential on another media. RE:A, unlike the first film, describes in depth the sinister acts of the Umbrella Corporation, the larges commercial entity in the world. Alice, the main character, has survived but it changed because of T-virus cells implanted within her body. She is now the strongest warrior ever imagined. The film also succedes in linking the 3rd game with well known characters such as Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera. This movie is kickass, with women wearing short skirts, gigantic monsters with a handheld mini gun, and zombies galore. I reccomend it to all Resident Evil fans, Zombie fans, and espcially the action die hard fans. They will not be dissapointed",4.0
Love the movie but hard to watch in some parts.,4.0
"This film from 1999 already in some ways feels like the product of another age.  Using only practical effects, no CGI, it tells the story of Joan of Arc and her quest to liberate France.  Was she a saint anointed by God to save France, or a delusional young woman, the film offers no easy answers.

I enjoyed it both as a historical war film complete with sieges and brutal battles and as a character study of St. Joan.  I'm no expert and can't really speak to the historical accuracy of the film but I do want to praise Milla Jovovich's acting.  She conveys a woman who is simultaneously driven and committed, with no uncertainty or doubt but who is also completely out of her depth.  She's no superhero, she makes mistakes and disregards reality too much, she almost defies reality by strength of will, but can't quite.  One great scene opens with a close up on Joan gasping, it pans back to show her holding her banner, standing defiantly before an enemy castle.  It's only after a minute that someone comes by to point out she has an arrow in her leg.  Joan seems to notice if for the first time...

It has flaws, but a lot of them are due to the filmmaker not wanting to offer us easy answers.

"I have been playing the game since I was eight years old, and I hoped they would make it into a movie quickly. When they did, I had to see it the very day it premiered. Back then, I thought it was the greatest zombie movie ever made.(Dawn of the Dead 2004 stole that title)

It wasn't much like the video game, but it was good. I wasn't expecting it to be good. It was low budget, and the trailer was just an unorganized mess. But I was wrong. It was a great film, and had one of my favorite scenes in movie history. The laser scene.

I'm glad they fired that idiot Romero from this movie. I've read his script. You can tell that he's never played the game before they hired him to do the movie. He based his script off the first Resident Evil game, and he ruined it. Chris had eagle friends? Jill left for the mansion first? Rebecca was always with Chris? No!!! He ruined the whole thing, and his style of zombies is pathetic.

Paul Anderson did a great job with this movie. People call him a bad director. I've yet to see a movie he's done that was bad. Can somebody tell me what movie is so horrible that nobody likes him?

Although the zombies weren't fast, they did make fierce and vicious sounds. I liked that.

So this turns out to be a good movie. Better than anything Romero made.",4.0
"Personally, I'm into video games, though I've never played Resident Evil. A lot of people knocking the movie say that it doesn't stick tightly enough to the video game story line. Oh well!
I liked this movie a lot. It's one of the first horror movies I've seen in awhile that actually left me a little jittery (followed by 28 Days Later which is a better movie). The dialogue wasn't spectacular, but the storyline and cinematics were excellent.
This is almost more an action flick than it is a horror movie, which is quite fine by me. The action sequences are excellent and well choreographed. The special effects were also good and believable.
Don't go into this movie expecting it to change your life or move you, but it will definately entertain you.",4.0

"Okay, everyone.  This is a movie based on a popular video game.  Enough said.  Now, as a movie, it is a fast-paced, roller coast ride of a film.  We're not talking HAMLET here, folks.  Director Paul Anderson keeps the action fire hot, and the cast play their roles as one would expect in this kind of movie.

The visual effects (for a non video-game fantatic like me) are well done, and there are some jump out of your seat moments.  Milla Jovovich, who was so good in FIFTH ELEMENT, has a rubber face that displays a wide range of emotions for a basically undeveloped character.  Michelle Rodriguez overdoes the tough girl part, but is effective nonetheless.  Eric Mabius gives Matt both a tough and sensitive edge, and redeems himself for BLACK CIRCLE BOYS.  Martin Crewes as Caplan is quite good, as is James Purefoy (A Knight's Tale) in the role of Jovovich's undercover lover.  The monster dogs, zombies, laser killer and chief monster are all well done, and the movie's apocalyptic ending certainly leaves room for the upcoming sequel.

I enjoyed this much better than MORTAL KOMBAT, so I'm looking forward to the sequel.",4.0

"Resident Evil is a nitroglycerin packed horror film that is based on Capcom's best selling horror videogames with the same name.  Before the story begins the audience is introduced to the Umbrella Corporation that produces 90% of every home's household products.  However, its large profits are derived from military technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry, which is unknown to the public.  The story begins with Alice (Milla Jovovich) waking up with temporary amnesia caused by gas released by the Hive's supercomputer, the Red Queen, as a defense mechanism.  The Hive is a secret underground research complex with an exterior design similar to the form of a virus, which hosts over 500 scientists.  Alice learns through a group of special operatives working for the Umbrella Corporation that she is also a special operative and something has gone wrong in the Hive.  The mission of the group is to find out what went wrong and turn off the Red Queen that has seemed to run amok.  As the group enters the darkened corridors of the Hive they enter a nightmare that submerges them into an agonizing reality of hellish creatures that want to nourish.  Resident Evil is a fast paced horror tale where the unknown is known, yet the moment of surprise will cause nerves to twitch involuntary as it offers a creepy cinematic experience.",4.0

 First of all, this plot does not resemble the same story as the first video game, but I did enjoy this movie.  It is based on the same principal.  The train is from the ""Resident Evil 2"" video game.

  Everyone in the offices and laboratory of the Umbrella Corporation is gassed with a biohazard substance. Those that tried to escape in the elevator are killed.
  Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up naked in the shower. The room looks like a suite. She has no memory of how she got there. She is still under the side effects of the nerve gas. A red dress is laid out for her on the bed. She walks around the mansion. Another man, Matt (Eric Mabius) is there in the same situation. Suddenly, soldiers bust into the place. They take them downstairs. They see the Umbrella rooms and the underground Umbrella Train.
 The soldiers are James Shade (Colin Salmon), J.D. (Pasquale Alcardi), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan (Martin Crewes) and Spence (James Purefoy).
  Alice was a soldier too, but her memory is only coming back in bits and pieces.
  Their mission is to get to the Hive which is deep under Raccoon City. The Hive is a top-secret research facility, but getting through it will not be easy. You have biohazard zombies and other horrifying surprises.

  The cast also includes: Heike Makatsch and Jaymes Butler, Jason Isaacs.

  Screen Gems (remember them from television in the 1970's?) presented this film which is now part of the Sony Pictures Entertainment company.
  The audio commentary is really cool to turn on the second time you watch this film.  The video game is discussed.

"First off, I was very angry when I saw the teaser trailer for RE2 on their website. The reason for my anger is that it's the same commercial that was made for the Original!!! It was put together as a quick promo for the original and got lost in translation somewhere along the lines. Notice how no new footage was show except for the last shot of the first? Now, marketers took it, added the title Apocalypse to the end,and used it. Talk about cheap! Now, onto the movie itself...
This movie in my opinion actually has a chance to be great... a slim chance. Under the direction of rookie filmmaker Alexander Witt, we may be in for a rough ride. Paul Anderson has returned for the script, goodie :-(, and Mila is back as Alice. The plus side to this movie is that it contains characters from the RE series including Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliveria. But most of all, the main reason this movie looks remotely good, it that Nemesis will finally make an appearance. The greatest, scariest, toughest bad guy to ever appear in a video game will be on the screen.",4.0

"For all those that think the first movie was upsetting....well.  For one, the reason it didn't go with the storyline of the Games was because they were basically showing how it all started.  *shrugs* Most wouldn't figure that out....and blood and gore...sure that's all good.  But just because it doesn't have enough blood, guts, and gore doesn't make it a bad movie.  It's the storyline that makes a movie good.  I'm all for blood, guts, and gore......but I also look at the storyline.  Sure...it could have been a bit better, so could other movies as well.  That's how the creators strive to make a movie better.  I'm a big horror movie buff...and I've seen all old movies that didn't have all those ""gorey and special graphics"" and they were all good as well.  Welp, that's all I guess.  I'm looking forward to seeing this movie myself, specially if Nemesis is in it... (Is a big fan of RE games.)",4.0
"I have never played the games, nor do I know much of the story behind it. Perhaps that is good, because I won't like many reviewers be lamenting that it differs from it. Although to be honest, even if I did know the games I doubt I would care. I realise that movie versions of books and games differ, and as long as the story is good that's all that matters. I enjoyed this film, it wasn't a 'hide behind the sofa' film, but then these days, what is. We start with a bunch of people in an office slash science lab being killed. We do not know why but this grips us. We then cut to Milla Jovovich lying naked (covered by a shower curtain) in a bathroom. She doesn't seem to know where she is and gets flashes of memory. The action kicks off from there with SWAT like operatives storming the place along with a man who says he is local police. The action keeps on giving from there. People die in a myriad of ways, and you don't get a zombie here or there you get them BOOM all at once. I'm not sure if this is good or bad. One the one hand it makes the task of escaping (which they must do in an allotted time or be trapped forever) all the more impossible. On the other it's not a big shock when we see them all again, and again. The big creature wasn't scary, or rather, it was if we believed it to be real but I didn't. The dogs were scarier in that sense because they are more believable. I liked that the film had strong female characters. Now, I am no feminist but frankly, I'm sick of whiny, girls who want the man to rescue them. From the beginning, I knew Alice would kick booty, I mean the woman wears a pretty little dress, with combat boots. Michelle Rodrigez is a tougher chick but she also shows she has feelings and therefore doesn't feel one-dimensional. It's an interesting film with nice little twists. The soundtrack is both good and bad because it is by Marilyn Manson. I say that because as it's by him the film is labelled as a worthless teen flick, which is not the case. It's good because - and while some of his music does suck - the tracks included in the film are good. Not too gory, this again is both a blessing and a sin. It's a zombie film so we expect lots of gore but the fact not much is added makes it not just be about blood but has to have a plot too.

"Hello, I am a huge fan of the R.E. series (video games).  They were really freaky and fun to play.  The movie though, was a little disappointing.  I still love the movie, but it didn't follow very much of the game and the zombies were not scary looking!  The action is really good though.  I don't recall bein HIGH or anything, but i remember seein some of the same zombies in different scenes.  They die and then they come back for more later in the movie.  That was pretty strange.  Plus, there was barely any gore in the film.  Movies with zombies, mean movies with a ton of BLOOD AND GUTS!  I just saw the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD in theaters, and it makes R.E. look like a kiddie movie (rated G or PG).  The musical score of the movie, done by Marylin Manson, was AWESOME!  That kept the movie in a steady state of COOLNESS!  The acting was good too.  I love watchin Milla (Alice) runnin around (...)
  I really hope APOCALYPSE is goin to be good.  It should be, with NEMESIS in it that is.  (...)  In this next round of FUN, Jill is also joining in, and some other people, who i forgot about.  (...) this [may] be one of the best sequels ive seen in a while.",4.0

"I've seen a lot of Joan of Arc movies--I herd voices telling me this one was probably the most down to earth!

I wasn't sure whether to buy this movie or not, but after watching it--taking a chance it might be good--I was (thoroughly and pleasantly) surprised. Certainly, this rendition of Joan's story isn't your usual, bubbly, gushy, lathered on glop of over acted piety, that inevitably leaves the viewer feeling sandblasted, empty, and wondering why the pope himself doesn't hear voices too? Perhaps his eyes aren't as dreamy as Leelee Sobieski's. The Messenger is a hard--gritty--rendition of the French peasant girls rise to glory and her premature death by execution. And while its Joan (Milla Jovovich) doesn't have a soft tear stained face that could melt every Burgundian heart in the room at her hearing, Jovovich's insane expressions convincingly convey the pain, internal struggles, and feverishly pitiable attempts of a simple farm girl as she stumbles to weed out the reality of what she sees from the imagined. I easily found myself laughing with Joan's captains as the spunky French girl, with a fuse as short as the bob haircut she sports, charges recklessly into battle, like a whirlwind. While the musical score isn't anything to go scouring youtube for in the hopes of downloading, it doesn't fall completely flat (just into the background),The Messenger's cinematography is excellent, with diverse camera angles, shot that make every scene feel extremely real, and acting to bring down the chapel; not to mention a stunningly vivid burning at the stake finally that leaves us feeling as seared as Joan. I would definitely recommend this film, even though it is not considered as historically accurate as 1928 French film, it's an all together less staged take on the story of Joan of Arc.",4.0
"Just as expected, delivered as promises.",4.0
"Let me say straight off that I have never played Resident Evil (I don't get the time). I found this movie to be great fun with a shocking opening. I can't believe the opening isn't listed as being scary. I mean think about it, you're just getting ready to go home and the fire alarm goes off, you try to leave but you're sealed in and about to get dosed with Halon gas. I watched the opening sequence and it chilled me, because at the time you don't know who's deliberately killing the workers. Then we meet Alice (BTW no-one names her) who suffers amnesia. From then we get into the Hive and the horror that awaits.
I enjoyed this movie and found it moderately jumpy without being a gorefest (I don't like proper gore flicks). To the reviewer who asked why Milla is running around in a red evening dress, I have to ask: Did you watch the movie? It's made quite plain that she puts the dress on because it is laid out ready on the bed and she doesn't get the chance to change.
So it didn't go everywhere like the game, well to be blunt, that works in a game but in a film, it would look patchy and disjointed. All in all I liked this film, Milla is sexy and kick..., Michelle is moody and tough and the sounndtrack rocks. Can't wait for the sequel.",4.0
"This was a taut, chilling, and surprisingly effective zombie kill fest.  The opening with the lethal lock-down of the complex by the super-computer is at once coldly methodical, and deadly.  Milla as the heroine has transformed markedly since her Fifth Element days, and does an admirable job as the anesthesia victim.  This film really moves along at a great pace, the Marylyn Manson soundtrack kicks it up a notch along w/ the action sequences.  A deadly virus is released in an underground research complex, the host computer kills all the scientists rather than risk external exposure of the virus.  A security detail is dispatched to ascertain what went wrong, but are themselves targeted by the newly animated dead.  One of the better of its breed to be sure, very polished and gritty at the same time.  It works, recommended.",4.0

"...the commentary is even more entertaining than the movie.  Suprisingly, Milla comes off very immature and annoying (""can I just say? can I just say?""...), which are personality traits that I wouldn't normally associate with the model stereotype.  Because she's a sex symbol, I somehow can't help but be amused by her obnoxiousness (i.e. the ""gas controversy"" when she collapses in the shower).  Michelle points out her favorite weapons and ""sick"" scenes, while joking about Eric Mabius's pepper and yogurt binging.  The James Purefoy comparison to James Bond is equally funny at the right moments.  Although the commentary group's timing can be off, the facts concerning movie production are also appropriately balanced (i.e. the Alice in Wonderland analogy).  Overall, they just seem like a fun group to make a movie with- you can tell they enjoy eachother's company. There are many memorable lines and scenes that become the joke subjects of the actresses, director, and producer.  If you haven't been a fan of commentary yet than try it out on Resident Evil, where getting drunk on set and nude shots are better than stupid color grading.",4.0
"Reading through these reviews, I think what a lot of people really wanted to see, was a documentary. So yes, I must say straight away, that there are a lot of historical inaccuracies in this film both with regards to 'Joan' and her life, and also with the general story, costumes/weapons, etc.

By all accounts 'Joan' was not the crazed character that she appears in this film, instead being more quiet, pensive and humble, but I did find the fanaticism to be an interesting take on her; especially considering all the frustrations of being a low-born woman,obstructed by hierarchy and the male society as well as frantically trying to come to terms with these visions (something that becomes more apparent near the end of the film). Perhaps the director took it too far and she becomes seemingly a bloodthirsty zealot, but such fanaticism created a dynamism about the film which did help translate some of the emotion and passion to the viewer. I also enjoyed the visions that she suffered in the film despite them being inconsistent with those documented historically, as they did have the impact of making one think about all of the possibilities and whether 'Joan' could perhaps have merely saw what she wanted to see (even if such a conclusion (as would perhaps be logical based on this film)does not seem coherent with her own written accounts). So yes, it was nice to have a thinking point. Beyond this, the actual film was fairly slick, with great action scenes,evocative and impressive visuals, and a strong soundtrack. The performance of 'Joan' was strong, if not a portrayal that everyone would have wanted.

In conclusion, if you're expecting a strictly accurate telling of the life of 'Joan', maybe you should give this a miss. For others who fancy seeing a thought-provoking yet action-packed and punchy film, this one may be worth seeing.",4.0
"The story of Joan of Arc is one of the more intriguing stories from France. A female peasant who grew to power in a time when women and peasants didn't have a lot of opportunity to advance their social status. Ultimately, the movie isn't the most historically accurate movie, but it does get most of the major points correct and the battles take place in the correct order.

Milla Jovovich does an awesome job as the star of the movie and you really grow attached to her character throughout the movie and start to root for her. If you are looking for a movie that has decent acting, a good story, and great action sequences, this movie is for you.",4.0

"This film has a rather original - and perhaps not always convincing - take on the character of Joan of Arc, played here by Milla Jovovich as being somewhat shrill, or even hysterical at times. One reviewer wondered whethe she was really a Saint inspired by God (but then why would God necessarily take the French's side?) or whether she was ""plain bonkers"". Luc Besson, often original - regardless of whether tou likeor not what he does (and a lot of people tend to not like it - seems to have gone for some mix of the two.

This tends to somewhat summarize LUc Besson, his style, and this film in particular. It is spectacular all the way, from the battle scenes - as gory and ""realistic"" as you might expect - to Jeanne's ""voices"", pictured as if in some kind of fantasy or even a horror film. You like it very much or you dislike it just as intensily, or, you like perhaps some of it - the battle scenes are rather good, although they may perhaps feel a bit ""overdone"" -(and ""over gory"" in particlar), but then this is about personal preferences and since none of us were actually there, it's rather difficult to objectively appreciate whether scene A or scene B is ""realistic"" or not.

Now, to what extent is this film historically accurate? Here also, reviewers have tended to go to extremes. In fact, the film is generally more accurate than the average film we are used to watching, whether Troy, Brave Heart, Gladiator, Robin Hood (both the older version with Kevin Costner and the one with Russell Crowe), Kingdom of Heaven. However, everything is definitly NOT historical. The Director has taken a number of liberties, as Directors always tend to do. For instance, the beginning of the film, where the farm of Joan of Arc's parents is attacked and her sister gets into trouble, to put it mildly, is one of these inventions. Is it a howler? Not necessarily, unless who require each and every of your films that take place in Antiquity or during the Middle Ages to be as historical accurate as possible, but in such a case, there are hardly any that you will really like. On the other hand, there are also a lot of cases where Luc Besson has stuck to the historical record as much as possible.

After the ways in which the ""wicked English"" were rather mistreated in both Brave Heart and the Patriot (Mel Gibson in both cases, I'm afraid), some reviewers have been wondering whether, yet again, the English were being somewhat portrayed and caricatured as ""the baddies"", and were somewhat annoyed at it. In particular, some may have wondered whether depicting the English as insulting Joan and treating her as if she was a witch while also behaving as what could be seens as a cowardly manner, was not tainted with some unpleasant undertones of rench nationalism. This is, of course, a film done by a French Director, something than could fuel such a suspicion until one remembers how superstitious people were in the 15th century and on both sides (and how superstitious most of them were well before and well after). A young and (supposedly) inexperienced maiden leading to war seasoned warriors was simply unheard of at the time. That she was successful and brought victory a couple of times at Orlans, where the six months old English siege was finally broken, and went on to win a convincing victory at Patay and to escort the Dauphin to be crowne in Reims with her army, could only be a tremendous boost to the flaging morale of the French, who were clearly losing the war before her arrival, and, on the contrary, make the English wonder if the she was not Heavenly inspired, since all her enterprises seemed to be successful.

Besides, for those who might still doubt and wonder whether the Director is being biased, it is possible to check through the sources. Jeanne, regardlss of whether she was ""inspired"" or not, clearly presented a HUGE problem for the English Kingdom of France and the Duke of Bedford in particular, simply because some, in both camps, could believe that she was inspired by God, and therefore successful. This is alo why some much effort was put in by the English, once she was captured by their Burgundian allies, into having her handig over to them. The English could not afford to have her ransomed by the French because she had become a symbol. Moreover, they needed to destroy this potent symbol, hence her trial for witchcraft and her execution in Rouen.

The most interesting question of all is, of course, whether she really was ""inspired"" or not. The French Dauphin (an excellent John Malkovitch) and, even more so, his stately and scheming mother-in-law Yolande of Aragon (an excellent Faye Dunaway) certainly chose to believe so, and it clearly suited their interests. The Catholic Church made her into a Saint, but only in 1920. The French have made her into a national heron and she is now one of the symbols of the Far Right nationalist party in France. Interestingly, some revisionist French historians - but not Luc Besson who did not take this kind of risk - have wondered about who she was exactly and whether she really was ""divinely inspired"" or not. The starting point here is that it is highly unlikely for this young teen-ager to have really been a little sheperd girl for at least three reasons. She knew how ro ride. She wore armour and seems to have also known how to fight. She also has no problems in making herself understood at Court once she arried at Bourges, at a time where country folk in France spoke a wide range of dialects and languages - as opposed to Court French.

From there, you can start imagining all sorts of conspiracy theories, one of them being that she might have been a bastard half-sister of the Dauphin soon to become Charles VII and that thewhole thing was set up by Yolande of Aragon who knew of her existence and might even have been in charge for her upbringing.

Finally, another strong point in this film is the cast of characters. Some have liked Mila's performance. Others have hated it while still others have excused her by saying she was just doing what she was told and that is why she sounds and often appears shrill and hysterical. Granted, she was not, at the time at least, the best or the most professional actor you could think of but she coul have done a lot worse. Other actors are probably much better in their roles, such as Vincent Cassel playing a yound Gilles the Rais or Tcheky Karyo in the role of Dunois, commander-in-chief of the Fenech army and the bastard son of the Duke of Orleans (and therefore the cousin of Charles, future Charles VII). The other actors playing the French captains are rather good also, in particular La Hire, historically known for always swearing and who, to avoid being told of by the young girl, did a huge effort not to swear when she was around, or Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, or the duke of Alenon. These hard and seasoned captains all somehow deferred to Jeanne, however grudgindly, and this is also rather surprising and interesting coming from them. All had much more experience than her. Some were even royal kins. Most behaved more like mercenaries, or at least warlords, happy to kill, burn, loot and rape, but their all obeyed her commands, at least to a certain extent. In itself, this is yet another hint that there was something extremely unsual with Joan of Arc, whatever version you chose to believe.

So, at he end of this long review, and despite its limitations - I should have also mentioned the piece where Joan wrestles with her conscious played by Dustin Hoffman as being possibly the worst of the whole film - I believe this very entertaining and spectacular film, which is also more conventional that it may look and feel, is just about worth (a slightly generous) four stars.",4.0
"Let's get a fact straight first: We know very little about Joan of Arc, anybody who pretends they know her story and even her personality need to go back to the controversial historical records there is of her. Most of them are non-contemporary records, meaning they've been written way after her supposed death (imagine recounting WW2 40 years after it happened). Those records are also tainted by the era and personal beliefs of their authors.
Beware of the figure that has been created by the Church and the governing bodies of France over the centuries, France and England had been at war often and endlessly, heroic figures are part of the propaganda efforts. Even today her figure is used by very patriotic groups in France. By the way, I'm French.

This is why some reviewers totally miss the point of the movie, this is not a historical movie, this is the exploration of a mythical character. And as such, it's a great movie. What could be the psychological profile of an individual convinced she's been called by God to wage a war? Does that ring a bell for anyone in our times of religious fanaticism surges?

"I have always viewed Joan of Arc's story with incredulous awe.  The fact that an illiterate girl through her complete faith in God was able to lead France in reclaiming their country is unprecedented.  The irony here is that the Catholic Church was responsible for her burning at the stake.  I mean it wasn't enough that they burned her alive by rubbing tar all over her body to burn her more effectively, they also had to torture her before she was burned.  An then to make up for their mistakes they make her into a Saint.  This movie reflects the power of women and how men are threatened by their strength.  It is a beautiful as well as tragic at the same time.  This is one of the best films I have viewed in regards to the life of Joan of Arc.",4.0
"The Messenger, 1999 film

This story begins in 1420 when there is war from the English invasion of France. Joan asks forgiveness for her sins - again. She converses with `him', who tells her to be good and take care of people. Joan is happy like any care-free child. She finds a sword in the grass. Then wolves run past her! Her village is attacked and burned by soldiers. Her home is invaded. Her older sister Catherine gives her a hiding place. Murder, robbery, and rape follow. [That grave is too shallow.] Joan will live with her aunt and uncle now. Can she forgive her enemies? Did God save her for some higher purpose? In Chinon the Dauphin waits. There is a message from the Maid of Lorraine, a peasant girl who wants to fight for France. Is she a fake? Simple people believe in her, it could be good for morale. Joan comes to meet the Dauphin. She avoids the fake. [Cold reading?] She has a private message to deliver. She wants to ask the King of England to leave France in peace. Or else.

Joan rides to Orleans to defend the city. The people gather around. Joan has a new plan to attack the English. ""So that's it!"" The English reply with a simple message: never. Joan rides to rally the French. ""Follow me to victory!"" They do. They raise a bigger army before attacking the English. ""Bless them all."" Joan speaks to and inspires the French army. ""Follow me!"" Joan leads an attack and is struck by an arrow through her chain mail. The next morning Joan recovers and calls for another attack. Joan has a new tactic with an old tower to break into the castle. The French break down the gates and invade the castle. ""We won."" A glorious victory! But the English are forming on the other side of the river. Joan tells them to ""Go Home"" now in peace. Or be buried in the field. The British retreat, Orleans is free. It's a miracle. The Dauphin is crowned in Rheims. The holy oil of Clovis is used to anoint Charles of Valois the king and ruler of France.

There is another battle before the walls of Paris. Where are the reinforcement from the King? Has he lost interest? The costs of a big army are high, diplomacy is cheaper. ""France belongs to God."" Can they stop Joan from attacking the Burgundians? Joan is defeated and captured in front of the city gates. The Duke of Burgundy visits her. British gold is the high bidder, Joan will go to Rouen for trial as a heretic. The Bishop asks her to answer questions. Will Joan see her visions again? Did she see what she wanted to see? Joan is questioned at her trial. Her answers are popular with the people. Can they convict her? What is she had been sent by God? Joan never killed anyone, she said. As expected, she is found guilty of heresy and other sins. The College of Paris agreed with the judgment. [Corporate flunkies?] Will she recant her beliefs? She uses an ""X"" as an signature. ""Take her away."" This is a trick to absolve the Churchmen from her condemnation. Dressing as a man in jail condemns her. Can she save her soul?

Everyone knows what happened in the market square when Joan was nineteen on May 30, 1431. Five hundred years later she was canonized as a saint. [This is more than posthumous rehabilitation.] This is a very good story if slow and talky in spots. You can compare it to the earlier version with Ingrid Bergman, if you can find the video. The movie does not go into the political background of France and England. Later in the 15th century the English were involved in the Wars of the Roses. France defeated the Duchy of Burgundy in the early 16th century.
Note how Joan was wounded with an arrow in her upper right chest, but at the end of the story she had a healed wound on her upper left chest. Continuity?",4.0
"A few unfortunate lines of dialogue aside, it's hard to see why Luc Besson's epic was met with such derision - it's full of some terrific film-making, the battles are the right size, the story's well-told and Milla Jovovich comes over surprisingly well as someone caught somewhere between God's will and psychosis. The inclusion, two hours in, of Dustin Hoffman as her conscience to address her own and the audience's doubts as to whether she is driven by divine guidance or self-delusion is an inspired touch that is completely unexpected in a mainstream epic on this scale. Unfortunately, it's also the point when the film almost crosses the line into Monty Python - the dialogue's just too funny too often, and somehow the notion of a 15th Century French Catholic peasant girl's conscience manifesting itself as a 62-year-old New York Jewish actor in a cowl doesn't seem overly likely. Curiously, these scenes work better on a second viewing when you're not caught so off-guard by them.

On a narrative level, these scenes do help punctuate the back-and-forth nature of the trial, but it would have probably been much better to have her in her cell talking to her unseen visions. There are still some compensations. The trial is well-handled, and Timothy West avoids the kind of ham that usually marks his cinematic turns (cf Cry Freedom) to give a surprisingly good performance as a mainly decent man trapped in an impossible situation, very similar to Ray MacAnally's role in The Mission. It's not a flawless film by any means, but it is one of the better and more ambitious 90s epics and one that's long overdue for reappraisal.

Columbia's DVD includes the European cut of the film (some 10 minutes longer than the US version), featurette Beyond the Icon, isolated score track and teaser and full trailer.",4.0
"Ok,This Isnt bad movie at all. If you enjoy horror Thrillers like Blade then you will enjoy this one. Full of good special effects and music and actually a well balanced storyline. Full of nightmaric creatures such as Zombies and Hellish Dogs and even a top-secret creature known as a Licker in the video game. If your not into Horror Thrillers this may not be a movie for you...but if you are this is a great movie that I myself think could be better but good enough to earn my support! Please check this movie out! and if you have played the game seriers definantly check it out If you haven't already!  I Give this one 4 and 1/4 stars.",4.0
"'Resident Evil' is amongst the two best Sci-Fi/Horror movies I've watched. (The other being 'Event Horizon' also directed by Paul W.S. Anderson)
The story is true to the game; a deadly virus has escaped in a secret facility called ""The Hive"", deep underneath Racoon City. The computer controlling the facility goes berserk, killing (?) everything & everyone in the facility.
An elite military team is sent out to investigate, and thats where the movie begins, accompanied by some awesome Marilyn Manson music. And there is barely a pause, until the great ending.
The only reason for the 4 stars is that the movie is not scary enough. The zombies just don't scare you.
But, Milla Jovovich, in a red mini-dress throughout the  movie, is stunning; she is great in the action scenes, and so is Michelle Rodriguez as Rain.",4.0
"The Messenger is currently airing on cable TV, and I will confess to being so amused and intrigued by the chunks of Luc Besson's big bellyflop that I was seeing in Cinemax's edited and cropped version that I went out and bought the DVD in order to give this film a proper second look. A decade ago, following the fantastic one-two punch of Leon and The Fifth Element, Besson suddenly seemed like the greatest popular moviemaker in the world. So, back then, I went to see The Messenger with sky-high expectations that were only bound to be disappointed. At the time, the movie seemed not only a pointless retelling of a story that has been filmed countless times but, worse yet, a mere star vehicle for Besson's then-girlfriend Milla Jovovich.

Ten years later, during which Besson, sadly, has been unable to recapture his earlier promise, but during which Jovovich has actually proven her chops as an actress sans Besson, The Messenger really does deserve to be reconsidered. It turns out to be a smartly-mounted, crisply-edited medieval war movie, more entertaining than Braveheart and others in this genre, and its light, humourous style actually seems prescient in terms of some of the less reverent historical epics that have been produced since. John Malkovich, who, back then, just seemed old and miscast as the Dauphin of France, now somehow seems spot on, a most knowing parody of his own egotistical image, and Jovovich, despite her technical limitations, is full of energy and fire and, as always, looks fantastic. There are even amusing echoes of Besson's more seminal work, with the story bearing striking similarities to that of The Fifth Element (beautiful girl suffused with a higher power saves medieval France instead of the world) and Tcheky Karyo providing a bemused sort of Leon to Jovovich's Mathilda on steroids. Besson's Joan of Arc may not be a candidate for cinematic canonisation, but it's a terrific movie that never deserved to be burned at the stake.",4.0
"I like the action in this movie and all the cast. Too bad things have not changed, just better weapons & more Religion.  Blu-ray is the best way to own any movie, best picture and sound.",4.0
"Resident Evil is a movie version of what is called ""Survival Horror"" in the gaming industry.  The ideas and a number of scenes are directly inspired by the Resident Evil Games.
Milla wakes up, naked in a shower and has no memory of the past.  She is in a large mansion.  Soon she is beset by commandos who claim she is one of them and that they work for the Umbrella Corporation.  In the mansion is an underground train station that leads to a large underground research facility that is in trouble.
In the facility, known as The Hive, the team is trying to shut down an AI computer that killed everyone in the facility.  Aside from the killer AI, there are plenty of zombies and even a monster.  The team must defeat these and get out before the facility becomes completely sealed.
Milla's character is central to the movie and she slowly regains her memories as the plot advances.  We come to know her better and feel sympathetic for her.
All of this is bound up and painted with classic elements of horror and action and blended so well you don't really notice the switches.  Camera angles, stunts and atmosphere really push the viewer's buttons and keep the fear and adrenaline running.
As the film nears its conclusion, the viewer tries to guess just what is going to happen and how it will be resolved, but the surprises keep coming until the final scene.
Very fun with a minimum of blood and gore for this type of movie, but with plenty of action and spookiness.",4.0

"this movie has a totally warped view of joan of arc...not inaccurate...but still strange.  the action is top notch, and the story-telling is amazing, but this cannot break free of it's anti-religious creaters.  this is a great movie...but not everyone will think so.",4.0
"There are many filmakers who have eagerly taken on the telling of the tale of Joan of Arc. I am not only impressed with the performance of model/actress/singer Milla Jovovich, but I was entranced by the strong force behind the goal of Joan in this version. Sticking with her troops when the chips where down, she is portrayed as a devoted woman full of motivation. Whether or not her story is true, it can inspire anyone who hopes to push their ambition past obstacles.",4.0
"The story of Joan of Arc is a myth and legend beyond religious belief and war stories, it is a true triumph of the human spirit.  Anything you set your mind to can be accomplished no matter how strange or outlandish it may be.  And Joan did it, to be glorified for all eternity for her bravery.  This movie came under some flack for some overdramatics and a bit of choppy story flow, but it fleshed out Joan for who she really was and how she was used as well as abused by the higher powers of heaven and earth.

Milla Jovovich plays Joan, a simple, illiterate peasent girl who came from a farming town in Lorrain, France out of no where.  In this movie, often ignored by other biographies or cinematic undertakings, we see how she was affected by the toils of war when her sister is murdered by English soldiers.  We also see how with a child's innocence she loves God and wants nothing but to find joy within going to mass and prayer.  Perhaps it is because of these reasons that she has her first visions as a young girl, innocent of the outside world and looking to the church for answers.  At age 19, she leaves her hometown to see the Daulphaine of France, played with the dignity and hauting ability that only John Malcovich can portray.  She seeks an audience with him to tell him that she has been chosen by God to lead his army against the English in the 100 Years War and see him rightly crowned as the King of France.

It has often been debated why it was that Charles believed Joan, and this movie offers some insights to more practical reasons rather than a true miracle.  Heavily influenced by his mother in law, played with kind of a creepy, witchlike appeal by Faye Dunaway, Charles has always doubted himself.  There was always a question about his lineage and his right to rule.  There was also a myth about a maid from Lorrain that was sent by God to lead France into victory.  She says it is what simple people believe; and, what the simple people believe is what will give him strength and power.  Also, according to myth and legend, when Joan was presented in the court to Charles, he had an impostor sit upon his throne.  If the maid Joan was truly of God, then she would pick him out of a crowd as the true Dauphaine.  Sure enough, Joan chooses correctly.  Joan and Charles would retreat into another room for a private conversation that only the two of them would witness.  Charles would emerge, according to witnesses, excited and amazed.  Did Joan perform a miracle?  Rather, Joan reassures him that she believed enough in him that he should be the true king of France.  Joan is given her army, and they would march onto victory.

The tide quickly turns for Joan after Charles is crowned.  The church as well as the crown are fearful of the power Joan has over the people and her inflating ego.  What would she attempt next?  They begin to clamp down on her, and as her next war attempts would result in a disasterous failure, she is jailed and found guilty of being a heratic.  Joan is burned at the stake for her crimes.  Some say that her heart, as it was pure, did not burn.  Hundreds of years later, she was canonized as a saint.

What is the morale of the story?  There are hundreds if not thousands of morales.  Perhaps the most telling of situations is when Joan, in her final days behind bars, is confronted by Dustin Hoffman, her own doubts.  He asks her what her sins have been and how she got into this place.  Her sins were pride and vanity.  Maybe she didn't really hear the voice of God.  Maybe she was just a nutcase who happened to be in the right place at the right time.  Maybe she was the fall guy for a botched military movement, a weak king, or a patriarchal society.  Whatever the reason, Joan was a hero.",4.0
"I admire Besson's interpretation of the story of Joan of Arc. Being a huge fan of The Profeesional and The Fifth Element, I couldn't help but like The Messenger. I remember when I first saw it in the hotel room I stayed at in Asheville, North Carolina. I was astounded. Everything about the movie was good. The battle scenes, for one, were good. Not as good as Braveheart, but they were all right. I love good music in a movie as well. The Messenger's was good. Excellent actors and actresses to play the parts. You couldn't help but like Joan's colleagues in war. Especially the big guy whom Joan always reprimanded for swearing. But there were some things that I wasn't too happy about. Now I knew that Dustin Hoffman's ""The Conscience"" was either an evil spirit or the devil himself, but I'm still leery about the boy who grew up to look like Jesus. I wasn't sure whether he was a good spirit or a bad one. Also, I didn't like the fact that Saint Michael didn't appear to Joan. Although, Saint.....I forget. And I'm Catholic. Anyways, that saint did appear to her in the chapel. She broke through the glass and revealed herself. And lastly, the portrayal of Joan as being mentally ill. It was kinda cool in the fact that you got to see the psyche of Joan, but Besson probably has her turning in her grave right now. But, all in all, Besson still managed to show Joan as the heroine she was.",4.0
"I thought Paul Anderson has done a really good job at directing this movie, and 2 of the cast members doing a funny audio commentary with one of the director's producing buddies.

I would have given this 5 stars, if the movie wasn't too short and extended by 10-20 minutes.  But I definitly gotta catch the sequel whenever it comes out.",4.0
"Divine Message or Hysterical Delusion?

It is 1425, and France is a corpse-strewn battlefield. Since 1337 the land has been ravaged by the Hundred Years War between the English, the French, and fickle barons and dukes willing to shift their loyalties for gold, titles, and land in Perfidious Albion, north of the icy Channel. English soldiers, brigands, and madmen roam the countryside, burning, looting and pillaging everything in their path.

It is a time of frenzy; it is a time of ecstatic vision.

It is a time in which the messianic Joan la Pucelle, later known to history and fate as Joan of Arc (played in wide-eyed wonder by the gorgeous Milla Jovovich), emerged, born into an ensanguined world and bearing the word of God Himself on her lips to the future King of France, the hapless Dauphin Charles.

It is this fiery, faith-driven, brink-of-madness world which Luc Besson attempts to conjure up in the uneven ""The Messenger"", which shares a little of the fevered madness of its wild-eyed heroine.

What is the true nature of the Divine? How does He talk to His servants? How do you know the voice of God is really the voice of God---and not something else, something malignant, the voice of a demon or possibly madness? To his credit, Besson plunges deep into this dilemma, and the opening sequences in which Joan's young visions come heralded by unearthly winds and a vision of a glowering, leering (and ultimately aging, decrepit, and senescent) Christ are unsettling and horrible, suggesting that the source of her zeal may not be divine in nature.

Besson has always had a flair for visual artistry, and ""The Messenger"" is no exception. The imagery, assisted by veteran cinematographer Thierry Arboghast (who worked with Besson on ""The 5th Element"" and also served as Director of Photography for the lush ""Ridicule), is rich, striking, captures the feel of the 15th century battlefield, and throws the viewer into battlefields and siege trenches fertilized with gore and muddy pastures turned into rancid abattoirs with the blood of the dead.

The battle sequences are handsomely mounted, vivid, compelling, and brutal, particularly the Siege of Orleans. A sequence introduced by a shot from a trebuchet (a piece of medieval siege artillery) is at once remarkably faithful and dramatically awe-inspiring.

Fashion model Milla Jovovich does a fine job with a challenging role, and makes ""The Messenger"" her movie; her expressive face says more with a glance or a turn of the mouth than lesser actresses could with 100 pages of dialogue.

John Malkovich is at his purring, brooding best as the Dauphin; Faye Dunaway brings history to life as the devious Yolande D'Aragon; Tcheky Karyo provides the heavy weapons support and uniformly stolid jawline as the phlegmatic, doubting, faithful Dunois; Vincent Cassel seems to be having the time of his life as the laughing Gilles de Rais; and Dustin Hoffman has a shadowy, skulking, gloriously contemporary little part in tempting, tormenting, and confusing Joan.

For all of its pageantry and scope, this is a decidedly intimate little film that has far more to say about the nature of Faith and Things Larger than Oneself than it does, necessarily, about the historically enigmatic and ambiguous St. Joan.

This ultimately makes Besson's sins (all those of excess, the very best kind) forgivable, because this final inquisition between Joan and her hooded tormentor makes the film so much more accessible to all us, beset as we are by our fears and doubts.

The final question, once all the fire and blood and plunder and ruin of ""The Messenger"" succumb to night and silence, is this: do we hear the voice of God because we finally allow ourselves to listen---or because we so desperately want to hear?

"After watching the movie on the cinema, I was waiting for the DVD edition.. Before checking out the extras, here is the story:
  The movie tells that, in The Hive, an underground Umbrella Corporation laboratory, a computer who controls the whole laboratory, called Red Queen, killed everyone down there when she found out a virus was released inside. To prevent contamination outside The Hive, Red Queen closed every way out of The Hive and killed everyone. After that, a team is sent to ""turn out"" the Red Queen. What will they find? That's what you'll see... (See more about the movie in my Resident Evil - Movie Showtimes Review)
  It's rated R because of Sci-Fi/Horror Violence (zombies, blood, this kind of things you see in the games), language (some f-words, s-words...) ande brief sexuality/nudity (you can see Milla Jovovich's breasts and vagina, real quickly).
  The 5.1 Surround Sound is really good, and so is the image (Widescreen). The main menu is animated, there are the Scene Selections, audio in English and French, caption in English and French.
  The main extras are:
  - Making Of: A basic Making-Of.. How were the main scenes made, some things are said about the Red Queen corridor... You know, it's a Making-Of...
  - Scoring Resident Evil: Tells about the movie sountrack. How was it to be working with the antichrist superstar Marilyn Manson and the classic musician Marco Beltrami? Was it easy? Or was it really hard to mix both styles?
  - Zombie Make-Up Test: It's basically some zombies running around the screen.
  - ""My Plague"" Music Video by Slipknot: It's the video of the main song in the movie soundtrack. It mixes and Slipknot show with movie scenes...
  - Cast & Crew Commentary: Paul Anderson (director), Milla Jovovich (Alice), Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) and Jeremy Bolt (producer) make a very interesting and funny audio commentary.. Lots of humor, one of the greatest commentaries ever in my opinion...
  - Costumes: A basic movie explaining how were the costumes created, how did the cast and crew felt about them...
  - Set design: The name tells everything.. How were the sets designed, what was the most difficult...
  It's worth a buy if you watched it and liked it. If you didn't watch it, just rent it, and see if you like it...",4.0

A very well made historical film about a very controversial character. Excelent acting.,4.0
"Best:
1) The story of Joan of Arc is fascinating and this version is probably the most accurate that we'll ever get (since we have only sketchy information in the history books).
2) There is plenty of gritty battle action with blood and body parts flying.
3) The wide assortment of of medieval weapons used (catapaults, gravity cannon balls, multiple arrow shooters, boiling oil, maces, flails and decapitation devices) were more varied than any other movie. That alone makes this one a classic.
3) The movie explores Joan's later doubts about her voices/visions being from God very well. They use a imaginary devil's advocate character (played by Dustin Hoffman) to allow her to argue with herself. In the process, we're given a lot to think about ourselves.
Worst:
1) Milla Jovovich over-acted at times, especially when the camera was close to her face. That made her character a little scary. (Who knows, however, what the real Joan was like).
2) The only special feature is a very worthwhile 25-minute documentary about the actual historical events surrounding Joan of Arc's life. It would have been good to to have even more background information on this fairly complicated story.
Recommendation:
The low amount of special features is the only reason I don't give this DVD 5 stars. The movie itself is so rich that it requires repeated viewings to catch everything. Both men and women should find something to like in this epic.",4.0

"I really enjoyed this movie after playing the playstation game,
this DVD is absolutely crystal clear and beautiful as is the soundtrack.  The special effects are very good, and I enjoyed watching the very well dressed but incredibly stupid special hit team get their collective butts kicked by zombies and monsters.
I am retired special forces and watching small units in military action in both war and horror can be a hoot.  I found Michelle
Rodriguez to be disgusting in her cheap imitation of that incredibly ugly rapper ICE T. She continually tried to look out
the top of her eyes while tilting her head down while scrunching
her face up like ICE T.  She tried talking like him, and rolling
her head around like him, and tried to be so macho while failing
miserably.  She was uncontrollable and left the unit at times to
solo recon which is a cardinal no-no in that type of situation.
Aside from that this movie is a one dam good zombie stomping movie and the end leaves you dying for the sequel which is coming
in 2004.  I highly recommend this movie to any horror buff who
likes a well made movie.",4.0
"I was a bit worried this movie would be nothing but another bland horror attempt, but thankfully Resident Evil is far more. It has the visual effects, the soundtrack, and the acting to really shine. The story is complex enough to keep you guessing, but simple enough to let the action flow. Resident Evil is the truly first good horror movie in quite some time.
The visual effects of RE are quite unique. A beautiful mix of all CG scenes with live action really puts that video game fill into it. The often overlooked fact is that as a RE gamer, you usually have at least in part a lot of info on the world around you. You know things you couldn't otherwise know. For example, how things work, maps, where things are, etc. This movie does a great job of keeping the viewer informed in this manner, without going so far as to ruin the surprises. As for the undead, this movie is unmatched. The way they move, moan, and even die is exactly what any RE fan will expect. It's really good to see the attention to detail.
The soundtrack is every bit as cool. In the theater it sounded incredible, and it certainly doesn't disappoint at home. For all of those out there watching on some crud two speakers system... you'll miss out. The movie just doesn't have the same punch without the deep bass and creepy ambient surround sounds around you. For all of those with the system to handle it, you'll have a new showcase title for your DVD collection.
As for the acting, the downfall of so many movies, it's simply outstanding. You really do feel as if you're watching an elite squad of jaded specialists. It's somewhat like Starship Troopers, in a different setting. I really felt convinced of the performances. When they're hurt, they act hurt. When they're scared, they're scared. There's very little room for uncertainty here. If they actors aren't upset about being injured, or scared of the death that surrounds them, then it's quite hard for the audience to be concerned either.
Resident Evil manages to not only get the job done, but to excel. It should pass all expectations you may have for it, and surprise you a few times as well. It certainly ranks among my favorites as an action / horror flick. I honestly believe it would even if it didn't have the game series behind it.

"Funny thing is, this movie manages to be very entertaining and well made, despite being absolutely nothing like the videogame series it was based on.  Oh sure, you've got some famous monsters from the game.  There are zombies and for a few scenes some lickers, but the suspense and claustrophobia the game was famous for gets thrown away in favor of violent action.  The eerie fixed camera angles from the game are ditched.  The bloody hallways, and creepy silence is lost, and instead we get a futuristic science lab type building.
  But still, I found myself enjoying this movie anyway.  It reminded me an awful lot of Blade and Blade 2, so anybody who is a fan of those two movies should check this one out.
  All in all, I think I would have enjoyed a movie with the spirit of the game a lot better than this action oriented film, but it is still very fun and worth seeing at least once.  The hard rock soundtrack didn't exactly thrill me either, but it is still a movie horror fans or fans of the game should watch anyway.",4.0
"To begin with, lets get one thing straight, video games do not make great movies. Like books, video games are a different sort of medium and when turned into movies are usually nothing more than cool bad movies. With that said, I was really surprised by RESIDENT EVIL.  I had never played the video game, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie uses film techniques and cliches borrowed from a host of other films, e.g. THE MATRIX, ALIENS, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD just to name a few. Yet, the movie sucked me in. I was enthralled by it. I got caught up in the action and the story and kept wanting it to go on.
There isn't much dialogue here and therefore the acting is limited to physical reactions, facial expressions, body movement, and action sequences. The movie starts off slow and confusing with the seemingly hodge-podge of scenes not making any sense. However, once the background to the film is given and after a few flashbacks are seen, things begin to fall into place.
The movie is classified as a horror movie. However, it's really more of an action/adventure or sci-fi movie with a little gore and for a horror movie the gore is rather tame.
I've read a lot of mixed reviews about people who have played the game. Some say it strays from the games plot, while others say (with the exception of character changes) stays pretty close to the original video game. I don't know. However, I do know that I really didn't think I would like this movie, but I ended up liking it and was thoroughly entertained for 90 minutes.",4.0
"It was exactly what I expected and even a little more.  Very stylish movie with a lot of fast paced action, and Milla is hot throughout.  It seems that either most people liked it or hated it.  It is a rental for sure, and if you're like me you'll probably buy it.",4.0
"Milla Jovovich is astonishingly good in her performance as Joan of Arc. The supporting cast is excellent as well.  Cinematography, sets, costumes are all perfection. Mystical sequences are suitably bewildering...are they from the mouth of God or madness? The seemingly endless battle scenes, the thick dark brutality of 15th century warfare, the ruthless machinations of power and betrayal are filmed mercilessly to great effect. The blunt, relentless savagery bludgeons us as we are plunged ferociously into the fray, urged on by a frenzied, schrieking berserker with an angel's face. Regardless of whether you prefer to see Joan's story as myth or history or a combination of the two, this film is a powerful depiction of the mayhem and miracles of martyrdom that can occur when an individual's voice of conscience and reason are lost in the blast of an angry god's screams of retribution. Whether manufactured by religion, manipulated by the state, morphed from some secret personal madness, ""holy war"" has never been the work of the Creative and Loving Spirit that moves the Universe. Suffering and the horrors of war come from people. I didn't see this film when it was in the theatres, but saw it on VHS three years later.  It stikes me that the people behind the 9/11 tragedy, the people who clamored for the death penalty the moment the D.C. snipers were caught, the kamikaze pilots of World War II, and all those down through history who call upon death with a righteous voice have a little of Joan of Arc within them. Who spoke to Joan...the God or the Satan of her religion? Or were the voices from the deep well of her own psyche twisted and turned about by the times in which she lived? Can it be that Bin Laden and Joan of Arc are cut from the same cloth? When will it end? When will it ever end? This movie asks powerful questions that need asking today more than ever.",4.0
"Just as most of reviewes said, this movie is not too ""sticked"" to facts about Joan D'Arc, but the value of the movie is not the historical one. It is the first movie that gives an atheistic point of view on Joan of Arc. In the movie, St. Joan was pretty schizophrenic and she expiriences religious trances from time to time. Dustin Hoffman as her conscience, represents the logical side of the story and he, in fact, represents the new, atheistic, analysis of Joan D'Arc biography.
From artistic point of you, at the end of the movie, I had feeling that I've got too much explanations, although I understood the filmmakers allegation at the middle of the movie, trough excelent allusions that they gave. Every other aspect of movie is done excellent - the acting, the coreography, the directing...
There are many people that will deeply disagree with the claims of the movie, but it is still interesting to see it and see what the ""other"" side thinks. For atheists, the movie answers exactly on the question: who REALLY Joan D'Arc was, inspite of some historical mistaces that are made in the story.",4.0
"A fascinating movie. Much of the negative criticism here objects to the movie's treatment of history and to the depiction of the medieval Catholicism that roasted so many at the stake. Both critical strains miss the movie. Joan has long since ceased being a historical person and has entered the realm of myth and legend; as for her being a saint, well, I have no idea what a saint is. But the movie presents a very human Joan in a drama superbly acted and incredibly filmed.
Other objections are to beheadings and dogs gnawing at the slain. Fascinating -- we want our saints saintly and wars antiseptic. If that's what you want, don't watch this movie. Admittedly, the war scenes are not historically accurate. They are far too mild to reveal the nature of death in the Hundred Years War. But here the objection was not with the historical accuracy. For viewers less comfortable with ambiguity and blood, perhaps an G-rated version is more appropriate. But Joan lived in X-rated times.
The Messenger is a very good movie, much more controlled and sustained than The Fifth Element or La Femme Nikita.",4.0
"Besson's ""Joan Of Arc"" is just short of a masterpiece! Many dismiss it as just show but Besson knew better and flanked his vision is powerful images of war, horror and outstanding acting! Jovovich deserved an Oscar Nomination for this film but due to the films minor flaws such as its often missed directed musical score and bad casting of John Malkovich, voters went cold. The story takes liberties here and ther but a deeper story is there taht no film has ever touched and to really grab the genrebending myths behind the real Joan of Arc who was really called ""Joan The Virgin"" makes this film even more compelling. Facts like the French may have been embrassed by a poor woman leading them to victory and that Joan was very afraid of being burned at the stake and jumped from the 70 foot high tower which was her prison without a scratch on her when she landed! obviously she was recaptured and burned but while at the stake the crowd began to change their views and demanded for her release. It took the executioner 5 trys to burn her at the stake due to the fire kept burning out! Joan was not on trial for crimes committed against an English king but for immorally corupt behavior due to her donning mens clothing which magically found its way into her cell! This is what she was killed for being a witch! The english belived it looked bad to give just a mere powerfull, intellignet, brave, self driven-19 yr. old the hand of death but to murder an all powerfull witch her last due was justified! Besson's take on this is brilliant painting Joan as a saint to those who love her and powerfull to those who fear her! The film does not paint her as diluted but as the English would want us to view her! Hoffman is brilliant as the FILMS voice of reason and as a whole the images and sounds take full advantage of the films epic scope! A must by alone to see a distraught Jovovich in a wheat field telling an army of thousands to ""Fight Me If You Love Me""! About as close to the true Joan as we might see for a long time...a must own!",4.0
"Based on the video game of the same name.  Resident Evil stars Mila Jovavich as Alice, a member of a group that is supposed to protect the Hive.  The Hive is an underground facility owned by Umbrella Corp., an orginazation that specializes in bio-chemical products.  Little does anyone know, but someone has tried to steal a secret formula that bring on the end of the world as we know it.  In doing so, they have set loose a chemical that keeps the dead alive and truns them in monsters who only crave one thing, human flesh.  Alice and her group must infiltrate the hive, and find the red queen, a computer that controls everything in the hive, and find out what caused her to go crazy and kill everyone.  In doing so, they endanger their own lives because they must let loose all of the flesh eating zombies to get the hard drive that holds the red queen.  Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, and Martin Crewes.  They must all work together if any of them wants to get out of the hive alive.  One of the best video game to movie adaptations I have ever seen.",4.0
"this movie was good as a action movie and just as good as a spiritual type of movie. It was sad, touching, and hartwarming. I say this movie is a must see.",4.0
"The Messenger: The Story of Joan Of Arc, was extremely moving. I thought the film portrayed Joan Of Arc as she would have likely been. Her constant compulsion to confess her sins, and her visions of God, seemed realistic. For a late-teen, female, during the Hundred Years War, to have convinced the King of France to give her command of an army, Joan Of Arc must have been as eccentric as Milla Jovovich presented her. Jovovich, and her surrounding cast, did a good job.
I think the film's use of Dustin Hoffman as Joan Of Arc's conscience was very well done. I noticed in other reviews, that several people found Hoffman's role to be confusing. I understood clearly what his character represented. He symbolized Joan's conscience, and her process of self examination after being captured.
Also, I think the film's battle scenes were well done. The costume and prop work was nice too. The Hundred Years war saw the dawn of some amazing advancements in armor, battle tactics, and weaponry, and The Messenger did a good job in demonstrating that. Many other films from this era show only a handful of men-at-arms, with the remainder of the armies being lightly armored infantry. Finally a film had a majority of it's fighting men in full armor, the way they actually were during the closing years of the Hundred Years War.
The only flaw that I found was minor and superficial. I found some of the musical pieces to be a little too modern sounding. I do not like it when period films use modern style music. But I only noticed a couple ballads that bothered me. Other than that, I found no problems.
Overall, The Messenger receives four stars. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the history of either The Hundred Years War, or that of Joan Of Arc.",4.0
"Visually dazzling and hypnotically exciting, the Messenger is a movie that never fails to entertain. Staying true to Besson's flamboyant film style, the movie begins so well, that it grabs you and doesn't let go. Its too badit doesn't completely hold out to the end, but Jovovich's wild-eyed performance more than makes up for that fault. Historic film making at its finest.",4.0
"The story of Joan of Arc is familiar to most, and I appreciated this movie for putting a spin on it. Dustin Hoffman plays her 'spiritual guide' in a way that makes one wonder if Joan was truly a tool of God. An interesting footnote was that she was made a saint almost 500 years after she was burned. The dauphin was played admirably as a young bumbling king. Almost all the French Kings of history were buffoons save a few.
But what makes this movie stand out is the terribly violent battle scenes. In an age before gunpowder, the imagination used for weapons was truly astonishing. The 'bowling balls' that were dropped and shot out of the castle was something I had never heard of before. The 'gatling gun' arrow machine was also gruesome. The decapitation device that swung as soldiers reached the casle roof was another example of the horrific violence of being in the military in those days.
If you're not particularly interested in Joan of Arc, check out this flick for the battles , they'll leave you floored.",4.0
"I have never played any of the ""Resident Evil"" video games, but I understand this film is very faithful to the storyline -- specifically, it serves as a prequel to the first game (the end of the movie is apparently the beginning of the game). As a video game adaptation, this film is one of the most solid I've seen. Yet it takes most of its cues from the video game paradigm, and is constructed somewhat like the video game we all wish we could play.
All the elements are here: The Red Queen, the AI which controls the movie's environment, is like the ""dungeon master."" It's a lethal adversary, yet it provides backstory, context, and objectives, i.e. the ""mission"" of each ""level."" Its primary goal is the extermination of the human characters, yet it bargains with them and even at times saves them for various purposes, rather like the way the rampant AI Durandal behaves in the famous ""Marathon"" game series.
The main character, Alice, arrives in the movie just like a video game character: No weapons, no clothes, no memory, just a heightened perception and a suite of deadly combat abilities. In order to work out her own situation and objectives, she must collect weapons and useful items along the way, and rely on her observations and on the exposition provided by others (as in a game's cutscene). That exposition, furthermore, is provided in a deliriously perfunctory scene executed as efficiently as a military operation, as if the filmmakers acknowledged the unfortunate necessity of this action-halting story element and decided to get it over with as quickly as possible.
And finally, there are the scores and scores of irretrievably feral zombies, which provide limitless guilt-free cannon fodder for the main characters to slaughter. This is something every action game provides in one form or another: Sufficiently independent humanoid enemies that are nevertheless so unquestionably evil (Nazis, Imperial Stormtroopers, alien invaders, demons, zombies) that you can blast away at them without reservation.
As a film, ""Resident Evil"" lacks a compelling storyline, deeply drawn characters and even well-choreographed action sequences. Instead, it focuses intensely on cinematography, production design, sound, and editing. This actually makes for a more interesting film, since nearly every frame is a carefully constructed movement within the scope of the film. Its goal, put simply, is horribleness. This movie, like other films such as ""Final Destination"" and the director's own ""Event Horizon,"" elevates the terror of danger and death to an art form. How terrified can you be before you die? Getting shot in the back or killed in a car accident is tragic and even painful, but at least it's quick. The anticipation of a baroque and cruel death is milked dry in this film. Irony, too, is an important factor, as in the case of the businesswoman who squeezes halfway out of a stranded elevator only to find that the elevator's about to start moving again.
Although this film sometimes gets bogged down by inconvenient practical considerations (like having to get from point A to point B), and the unending horde of flesh-eating zombies tends to get old, it's a slick, carefully-made and professionally produced distillation of horror that's as fascinating as it is artful. The music and photography are excellent, and if you have the technology to watch the DVD in Dolby 5.1 Surround, you'll love the sound work. It also provides a few fresh twists that defy conventional action plots, and a beautifully rendered ending which inverts expectations at the same time as it satisfies the story's arc.",4.0
"I don't like video games to be turned into movies. However, this is a pretty good movie. (Not to mention Mila Naked) It lacked something along the way, and the super creature zombies [were bad]. The dog zombies were the best part of the film, and its worth watching just to see them, and mila naked. Definately worth watching.",4.0
"Being a movie based on a videogame I had low expectations but right from the start it grabbed me and kept me glued to the screen. The movie hold a high level of tension and terror right from the opening scenes. It does get somewhat choppy at times but overall I really enjoyed this movie. The vhs video quality is excellent and the audio is top notch with a clear, dynamic and very deep low and upper ends. Overall: VERY GOOD.",4.0
"As being part French myself I take my history very seriously. So when I first saw The Messenger, I was completly amazed. The movie left me in a speechless. The writing was remarkable and the actors played the parts very well! It is hard to play an historical figure and not offend anyone while playing the part well, and Milla Jovovich pulled it off in flying colors. She played Jehanne so well it is hard to think of Jehanne as anyone eles but Milla! John Malkovich was remarkable and Faye Dunaway is amazing. I really feel in love with Dustin Hoffman's proformance, but it was not long enough in my opinion. The movie was portrayed well and throughly.  But the only reason I gave it four stars was cuz the didn't really tell if Jehanne was pyschotic or a saint, maybe she was both. But us French thank her for setting us free, and I thank Luc Besson for making such a touching movie",4.0
"Not many would appreciate what portrays Joan of Arc as is in Luc Besson's The Messenger: Joan of Arc.  She may be not the one the Church has told us.  She may not be the one written according to the historical documentary.  But she may be the one she could possibly be.
One should not forget Catholicism has been constantly evolving, not to say the least Joan was sainted 500 years after her death by the Church who put her on trial in the English territory, city of Rouen.  Our view on the historical heroine might certainly be evolving too.
Joan perhaps was the Messenger.  Joan perhaps was the Maid.  Joan could, certainly, be the Revenger, driven by her own desire to make revenge on the Brits for her sister death. We should remember that we are sometimes the servants (or the maids) of God, sometimes we are just driven by our own internal desires. God knows it certainly well.  One could not become a saint on earth while he/ she struggles, but only after his/ her death.  On the contrary, the Holy Mother Church would not turn away (as the Bishop vividly said in the movie) anyone who repent, who make confession to the Church.
Yes, Joan constantly asked for confession.  The concept of confession is very important in the Catholicism and in the path to saint.  Luc Besson couldn't be more accurate in portraying Joan's feverish faith in God:  her confession in the beginning of the movie till the last,  the continuous examination by the Conscience, her absolute confidence in God when she was burned at stake.  That she won battle after battle, that she saved France from the foreigner in the 15th century, that her single-mindedness and devotion to her country are only penalized by her fellow countrymen out of greed, jealousy and power.
Luc's sense of black humor and MTV-style of cinematography might not appeal to everyone.  And Milla Jovovich sometimes is too dramatic. But to the fans of Luc Besson, you are completely satisfied by his vision, fast-cut, and enthralling exploration.",4.0

"Before watching MESSENGER I read the mixed reviews and expected a disappointing effort.  To be truthful I expected to watch the normal 20 minutes that I give most movies (13th Warrior, for example) and then turn it off.  But instead, this is a movie I will recommend to friends as a companion to Braveheart and Excalibur.  As for accuracy, I'm not a historian.  But if you want a grand scale motion picture that looks like you've jumped back in time then MESSENGER does not disappoint.  4 1/2 out of 5 stars.  Not 5 because the accents don't seem quite right.  NOTE:  I recorded a copy off the pay channels but plan to pick up the DVD for the widescreen treatment.",4.0
"The Messenger is a very thought-provoking film. I was very surprised to see a movie in-which Joan of Arc is portrayed to be very erratic, obsessed...perhaps, even schizophrenic. However, her behavior makes you wonder. Where does inspiration come from? If you hear voices, are they good ones? If you think you hear the voice of God...is it God, or your own Ego? Watch this movie and contemplate the deeper meaning of who you are and why you do the things you do. The sets are wonderful and the message is power-packed. I truly loved the characters, even if I was a little surprised.  Some of the supporting characters are just as interesting as the main characters--but, I don't want to ruin the moments! The Battle scenes are terrific, they make you want to grab a sword and go fight for a cause.  This movie does an excellent job of revealing the Patriarchal Dictatorship of the church, as well. You will wish you could walk into the movie and knock a few heads together, then give a lecture about proper behavior amongst ""men of God."" This movie has it all...war, treachery, deceit, religion, good special effects...and a beautiful woman running-around in full battle gear. Things get very surreal, near the end, you'll love it!",4.0
I wonder that George A Ramero was not  mentioned more in review. This movie seemed to me to be a modern big budget dawn of the dead in space. It DISTURBED me greatly. Pretty horrible so if you like that sort of thing you are likely to like this. I'm not sure if I liked it or  not but it was interesting and compelling.,4.0
"Simply amazing! What's great about this movie is that it's the first good video game to movie transition I've ever seen! As an avid Resident Evil fan, I noticed that even though the characters and storyline differ from the popular Capcom games, many of the basic elements are still there! I even noticed similar sound effects and background music at certain points of the movie!
For all of you Resident Evil fans out there, go see it! You won't be disappointed! As for those who haven't played the video games before, you will enjoy this as one of the more scarier movies since Aliens!",4.0
"Having never played the video game, I thought this movie was pretty good and stood on its own.  With an interesting storyline and some rather innovative twists, Resident Evil is fun--now I want to play the game.  Jovovich stars as a cop/heroine who gets mixed up in the whole ""zombies taking over the world"" thing.  But she has amensia and doesn't remember she's a cop, or what she was doing before it all started.  My favorite scene is in the tunnel of lasers where everyone was sure to met their demise.  It is fun and graphic and there's a few laughs thrown in, and overall Resident Evil is a good Friday night movie that will give you bang for your buck.",4.0
"As a lover of science fiction movies, I am too often disappointed by their ridiculous and over-the-top production and implausible plots.  While I grudgingly accept that far out tales are what make science fiction actual fiction, let's have some grounding in reality, okay?  This isn't the best movie I've ever seen, and far from the best sci-fi adventure I've watched, but it's certainly worth two hours of time.
The basic plot deals with a an elite group of characters trained for combat who are sealed underground in a complex known as the ""Hive.""  A deadly neurotoxin is purposely filtered through air vents and kills all who it comes into contact with.  Supposedly.  Soon you discover than while the toxin kills unmercifully, it also reanimates the corpses of its victims!  Think Frankenstein en masse set loose in a labrinyth.
Milla Jovovich is a capable actress, but good acting really doesn't drive this movie.  She's at least believable.  Rodriguez is over the top, but in a good way, as the ever-vigilant militant soldier.  Good action sequences and superb special effects render this movie one to consider.",4.0
"Resident Evil is, quite simply, the best video game to motion picture conversion to date. Now, granted, that may not sound like much given the ineptitude of films like Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, but it is a genuinely good horror film by any standards, and has its share of creepy atmosphere and flesh-munching zombies (and worse). Sure it employs a predictable soundtrack of techno and metal riffs, but it's appropriate enough here. Resident Evil is a far cry from Dog Soldiers and The Brotherhood of the Wolf, but it's got enough of the goods to make it worthwhile.",4.0
"I've been a huge fan of video game-based movies from ""Super Mario Bros"" to ""Mortal Kombat"", but I strongly think that ""Resident Evil"" is one of the best game-based movies out there.  The monster in the film looks like something from ""The Relic"", but without the eyes, and it's absolutely terrifying.  The mutant dogs were pretty graphic too, but just as cool.  The cast (Milla Jovovich & Michelle Rodriguez) does an excellect job playing members of a commando unit, sent in to investigate a viral outbreak that turned all employees into zombies.  I wonder how the sequel is gonna be like!!!",4.0
"For the most part, this movie surprised me with how well it was done. The costumes and the battle scenes are well thought out and the storyline lends a not-so-subtle ambiguity to Joan's ""holy quest"". She is left  wondering if God really has spoken to her. Did God tell her to drive the  English out of France, or was it her desire for attention that drives her  crusade?
Fans of Luc Besson will like this film for its modern-day  approach to a medieval story, and its oft-misunderstood protagonist. With  that said, I think that some of the imagery goes way ""over the  top"" for the period piece it is attempting to represent. I was left  wishing that Joan's visions were shown with more subtlety and respect for  the viewer. Overall, the story is interesting, but its exposition is  heavy-handed. The featurette on the DVD explains the incredible amount of  detail-oriented research that went into the film - research which is often  undermined by blazing, colorful, thoroughly-modern hallucinations. I really  wanted a good, cohesive story of Joan-of-Arc. With a little subtlety, this  could have been a highly rewarding movie. There are still great themes to  be had in this film, but you'll have to get past Besson's flair for  exhibitionism if you want to explore them.",4.0
"The bottom line here is that nobody knows what made Joan tick.  We can deduce  from her actions and her trial that she was a very complicated young woman, but  beyond that it's open to interpretation.  Was she insane?  - What about her  predictions?  Or possessed? - I for one can't even  imagine what that really means.  Perhaps she was just very impressionable  and instead of monsters under her bed she  saw angels?  That she was well  schooled in current political affairs I think we can  rule out.
The movie  had several inaccuracies the most disturbing of which was the rape  scene.  It seemed to have been done to rationalize her motives and was completely  unnecessary. (Save that for the rape of Boudicca's daughters or something  factual,  for the scene was effective, if loathsome.)  Also, the last half  hour of redemption,  justification and explanation with her  ""vision"" was utterly uninteresting.
That aside, Milla Jovovich  was brilliant and convincing.  She certainly portrayed a  very strong  willed, confused and angry girl capable of controlling an army.  The fact  that she came close to tears at all the bloodshed didn't contradict  anything.  We can't  forget that this was still a child in very unusual  circumstances. Without Milla the movie  would have been so-so.",4.0
"First of all, I don't remember much of what I learned about Joan of Arc in school. And after seeing this movie I don't feel like I know that much more. Actually some bells are ringing in the back of my head, indicating  that some of the elements aren't historically correct. Well, so some  liberties have been taken in the storytelling, but I was still entertained,  and that is usually the point in seeing a movie by Luc Besson.
This  version of the story of the famous warrior saint (or was she just crazy?)  is definitely the most colourful one ever made. Milla Jovovich generally  does a good job playing the part of Joan. Sometimes she's absolutely  brilliant, but other times the performance is not that convincing. I take  it that this is because of her having to work with Besson right after their  divorce. But speculations aside, the movie still turned out pretty great.  Generally the acting is quite superb, and the visuals are gorgeous,  something which has become a trademark of Besson. But like other  postmodernistic directors, he seems to focus more on the packaging than the  content. The script never really goes in-depth with the internal struggle  of Joan of Arc, and might be more suited for a regular action movie.
Still the visuals and the acting make the film worthwhile, but if you  want to see a historically accurate version of the legend, steer well clear  of this.
As it is, this can best be described as ""Joan of Arc Light:  the film that tastes sweet, but won't make your intellect fatter.""",4.0
"I knew that this movie was based on a computer game that my husband and his friends played, so I was a little hesitant about seeing it. I had heard it got bad reviews when it was in the theaters and thought maybe they were right. However I was interested in a movie where a woman kicks a lot of booty and saves the day.
Was I surprised!!!! This movie is so great! Its fun to watch and suspensful enough to keep you on the edge of your seat in many scenes. The gore factor is pretty high, but thats fine with me.
The score to this movie is also AMAZING!! Im a huge Marilyn Manson fan and the soundtrack to the movie is just incredible! He really outdid himself, even my friends who do not like Marilyn Manson music liked the score to this movie.
Ive seen this movie twice in a one month period and hope for a sequel! See it, its a fun movie and you won't be dissapointed.",4.0
"I have to say I wasn't that bothered about seeing this movie at the cinema, I've only played the game a couple of times and didn't really get hooked on it. So I have no idea why I bought it on DVD, but I am glad I did.
You don't have to know anything about the story behind the game to enjoy the film. I thought everything was explained really well, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) losing her memory and throughout the film having flashbacks was a good way to do it. The zombies were really well done, and the cgi Licker was good for the ammount of money spent on the picture, even though it sometimes seems as though it does quite fit into it's surroundings, like when it bursts out of it's holding box it looks a bit fake, too computery if thats even a word.
The part that surprised me was how fast the commandos die, but more to the point the way they die. The laser mesh was an excellent idea and really well done, even though the director admits it's taken from a film called Cube.
The special features were quite good, even though I'm not a Slipknot fan I think the song really suits the film and the music video is pretty cool as well. But the best feature is the feature length commentary. I had never listened to a commentary all the way though until this one. It doesn't just comment about the film but a whole host of other things. Milla and Michelle are really funny along with the director and producer, especially taking the p**s out off Eric Mabius and his yogurt adiction.
This is an excellent film, much better than I'd expected, and it is left open for the sequel.",4.0
"Before viewing this movie I'd recommend spending 24 minutes watching the documentary on the making of the movie. The background given will greatly improve the appreciation of the movie itself. We are taken around the parts  of France where Joan herself lived, and shown the buildings she lived in  and where the events shown in the movie actually happened. We are shown a  document signed by Joan that is 570 years old - WOW! For myself, it was  fascinating to see these ancient buildings and relics which without a doubt  helped me to better appreciate the actual movie. There is also info on the  100s of suits of armour and 1000s of costumes made that were as true to the  originals of that era as possible. They did this by taking the designs and  patterns for the costumes and armour from old tapestries and  paintings.
The performance of Milla Jovovich as Joan of Arc was brilliant  except near the end of the film where she perhaps overdid the ""poor,  nervous and bewildered Joan"" bit! I'd have given the movie five stars  if it wasn't for this. One point that I found inspiring is the way the film  showed how just one simple young peasant girl, deeply pious and obedient to  the call of God on her life could change the history of France, and perhaps  ultimately that of Europe itself. I don't know how intentional it was, but  what struck me was the way Joan feared disobeying God far more than she  feared offending the pompous and arrogant civil and religious powers of her  day. What wasn't made clear (perhaps because no-one really knows for  certain) is exactly how Joan heard the voices which told her what to do, so  we are treated to spooky wind noises, cloud scenes, bangs of thunder and  some guy in a stone chair in a wood!  Surely there must have been a better  way of showing her hearing ""The Voices?""
I titled this review  as Stunning and outstanding - and so it was. The picture quality is superb  as is the Dolby 5.1 Surround which is very powerful and rich in low  frequencies. Seldom have I enjoyed and been so deeply touched by any movie  as this one! This DVD is a must for any serious collector IMO.",4.0
"Being french, I am somewhat familiar with the history of Joan of Arc. This movie is well made and the historic details are compelling. The movie doesn't portray war as ""fun"" as it did not take away of the  gruesome parts of medieval wartimes. Even some of the medieval war machines  (porcupine, tailor spin...) are portrayed very accurately. The Actors are  very efficient in their roles as they portray the medieval mentality to the  best of our understanding.
My only drawback to this movie is the visions  of Joan of Arc as they seem to be needlessly stretched and done  deliberately to confuse the audience. they could have easily cut them back  by half without taking from the story.
Did Joan of Arc really have  visions from God? Maybe it doesn't matter. What matters is that SHE  believed she did and the people of France believed it also. This changed  the entire face of the England-France war.",4.0
"I liked this movie; I really did. It had a good cast, good plot.... it was a little too bloody, but what do expect from a bunch of war sceens? It really was an okay film. But she was portrayed as a crazy person, which I  don't really think she was. She really did seem crazy -- whispering half  the time (when she wasn't screaming her head off), eyes wide, seeing  things. I'm pretty sure those are the actions of a crazy person. And she  wasn't crazy. It would seem that one of the most prayed to saint in the  world would be given a little more credit, wouldn't you think?
Either  way, it is enjoyable -- whether or not she was portrayed an insane  teenager.",4.0
"Great acting by Jovovich and Malkovich.  Unparalleled cinematography and directorship by Besson.  Excellent supporting cast in Dunaway, Hoffman and many others.  The DVD has superior sound and picture quality, and a few extras.  The movie is a bit too long, and the historical facts may be  debatable, but [i]t was not a bad choice for me,  I really enjoyed it.",4.0
"Let's forget about historical truth.  OK, people did not go to a private confessional box in the 15th century as portrayed. The map of France did not look as we are shown in the movie's introduction.  Military technology  had not then invented all the siege devices shown on screen.  And nobody  but nobody actually understands what made Joan tick. You take your pick  from saint to tomboy and from heroine to crazy.  But Milla gives a  convincing portrayal of a gifted teenager who was used and finally betrayed  by the man (the Dauphin) she tried to help. It's a great story, marred only  by some silly sequences.  The French apparently tried to force open the  gates of Paris with three locksmiths and two men on a ladder!  Come on now.  By contrast, the battle scenes at the siege of Orleans are magnificent.  Vive La France.",4.0
"The Messenger Joan of Arc: If you like Period movies, and costume epics you have a good chance of liking this DVD. If you want things to be accurate as far as history, or(The Myth of Joan of Arc) you might not like  this DVD/movie because Joan is Portrayed as a bit of a nut.
If you can  keep an open mind, and accept Joan as a person of her times. You have a  good chance of liking the movie. The extras on the DVD try to explain why  they did what they did. Remember Joan of Arc's time was called, (The age of  Faith).
Overall a good DVD, worth the price, and worth a look. If you  like ""The Fifth Element"" get this one too.",4.0
"...No one in France 500 years ago knew that one peasent girlcould do everything that she accomplished everything she did was forgod and her country of France , but did Joan really hear voices fromthe heavens above was she given a sign or did she only beleive what she wanted to the small French teenager who was born in the village of doreme.
 Shes your typical teenager who's wild and very stubborn and at time presistant but she was also very brave and couragous and determined. When she approches the doufer of France she realizes her destiny is all the more closer after she passes a test to see who the real doufer is , she tells him about her visons that she is to lead the French army into battle at Orleaon they will take the castle underseige and with Joan they hope to gain the victory to crown there King.
 The battle scenes realistic and grousome and precise of the way this battle was and this film shows the scale and tragedy of battle. Avoiding a full scale war with the english she speaks her mind ...but when Joan wants to complete her mission the French don't want any part of giving her another army. The French would rather solve affairs with diplomacy but when she decides to fight she is captured and charged with treasen and called anything from a witch to a herotic she stood trial and after the trial she was sentenced to be burned to death at the stake in front of thousands of people.
 This is an epic movie version of this story the DVD has an inside look at the history of Joan and Trailers until Braveheart comes out this one will keep you busy great sound and cinimatography.",4.0
"The idea that every person of faith in the past needs to be 'demythologized' by a modern enlightned director is alive and well.  Like Scorsese's 'Last Temptation of Christ', this film presents what some call a  'more human' Joan.  That is, one that can be understood without making any  real reference at all to a messy, impolite God who does not deign to make  all his actions sensible to us.  For provoking thought with this humanist  version of Joan, I'll give this movie 4 stars.  But for playing too fast  and loose with the actual historical facts, I'll hold one star back.  yes,  I know it's only a movie.  But the liberty's taken are so crucial to the  real story that they must not be discounted.
1. Joan's older sister  Catherine was never raped and killed by Engilsh soldiers.  Besson presents  this mythical event and the trauma induced by it to explain Joan's hatred  of the english and explain why perhaps her mind became unbalanced enough to  believe she was some sort of divine messenger.
2.  Joan and La Hire,  the French Captain, ended the siege of Orleans by crossing the Loire river  on horses by boat, and then when the English began to pursue some  retreating French Soldiers, Joan and La Hire unexpectedly charged, causing  what became a panicked retreat.  This is what caused the siege to be  broken, not Joan leaping alone into the enemy camp itself and  singlehandedly cutting a rope to open the gate.
3.  Joan never left her  parents.  Indeed, her brothers rode with her on her campaigns, and her  father and mother were there at the crowning of Charles, King of France.
4.  There is no record that Joan was ever beaten or physically assaulted  as is depicted in the film.  They may have burned her at the stake, but  there is no record she was knocked about like this.
4.  When Joan was  burned at the stake, she requested of several churchmen who did not agree  with her sentence and were sympathetic to her that they hold a cross up  high where she could see it, so that her last earthly sight would be of the  cross of her Lord. She also cried the name of Jesus more than once as she  burned. This is different from the depiction of this event, where Joan  seems to die silently in terror as some churchmen seem to mock her by  waving a cross up where she can see it.
A good film, but not accurate  as to what actually happened.",4.0
"Historical relevance aside, Messenger is a pretty cool movie.  If you don't take it as an accurate chronicle of a figure who may or may not have existed several hundred years ago and instead just think of it as the  fantastical chronicle of a confused girl, it works very well indeed.
The  battle scenes were awesome, the humor, if full of colloquialisms, was good  but not overdone, and the acting was solid if not great.  My biggest  complaint is one that I am finding more and more in recent movies.  At some  points, the beautiful panoramic scenes which work so well on the big screen  backfire on TV screens...for example, when Jeanne is running across the  fields in the beginning, she is barely visible as a little speck on a  big-screen TV.
Overall, this was quite an enjoyable movie with some  likeable characters, some utterly despicable ones, and shining fight  scenes.
Recommended.",4.0
"I THOUGHT THIS FILM WAS EXCELLENT, CONSIDERING IT WAS MADE BY THE BLOKEY WHO MADE MORTAL KOMBAT. IT WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND STARTED ALMOST STRAIGHT AWAY AND STAYED TRUE TO THE GAME IN MOST RESPECTS EXCEPT FOR THE CHARACTERS NAMES AND SOME OF THE PLOT. I LIKED THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO MUCKING ABOUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE CHARACTERS KILLING THE ENEMY, UNLIKE MANY FILMS WHERE THE CHARACTERS HESITATE TO KILL RESULTING IN THEIR OWN DEATHS; THE CHARACTERS IN THIS FILM DID WHAT YOU WOULD DO AND USE ANYTHING AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO ENSURE YOU DONT GET KILLED. ANYWAY, I THOUGHT THE EFFECTS WERE VERY GOOD TOO, THOUGH BEING AN CREATIVE PERSON WITH AN EYE FOR DETAIL I THOUGHT THE 'LICKER' (THAT HUGE, SALIVATING, SKINLESS THING WITH THE TONGUE) COULD HAVE BEEN ANIMATED A LITTLE SMOOTHER AND THE LIGHTING ON IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DARKER, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT STOOD OUT A LITTLE TOO MUCH ON SCREEN, THOUGH THE DETAIL ON IT'S MUSCLES WERE SUPERB. THE SCORE DEFINATELY DESERVES A MENTION; THIS WAS ONE OF THE MAIN ASPECTS THAT MADE THE FILM FOR ME BECAUSE IT HAD, MARCO BELTRAMI (THE CROW:SALVATION AND BLADE 2 SCORE'S), PROVIDING THE ORCHESTRATIONS, MARILYN MANSON PROVIDING THE HARDCORE, ATMOSPHERIC, INDUSTRIAL ROCK AND JUNKIE XL PROVIDING THE DANCEY, TECHNO, SOUNDSCAPEING AND THEN THERE IS A NINE INCH NAILS TRACK IN THERE THAT SOUNDED LIKE IT INFLUENCED MARILYN MANSONS PART OF THE SCORE EVEN THOUGH THIS PIECE OF MUSIC IS TEN YEARS OLD... IVE BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK, WHICH IS ALSO VERY GOOD, BUT I WISH THEY WOULD BRING THE FULL LENGTH SCORE OUT, IT IS VERY ATMOSPHERIC, DRAMATIC, HEAVY AND DANCE LIKE AT THE SAME TIME, IF THEY DO PUBLISH THE SCORE IT WOULD BE A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SELF RESPECTING FAN OF ALTERNATIVE LISTENING.
...THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FILMS, THERE'S NO HARD TO FOLLOW PLOT AND THE ACTION COMES THICK, FAST AND FAIRLY GOREY (THOUGH ITS NOT THE GORIEST FILM EVER). IF YOU LOVE THE GAME YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS...",4.0
"First of all, I'd like to say that this is a very brainless movie. It plays out like an extended video game cinema, with lots of gunplay, yelling, zombies, and zombie bites. The characters are essentially movable, bendable action figures, complete with clip-on weapons and pre-recorded lines. The only difference is that when they get ""broken,"" they can come back and eat your flesh. I hate it when that happens. The actors include Milla Jovovich (who likes to look intense) and Michelle Rodriguez (who likes to glare at people from behind her eyelashes). They do their best, and manage to create fairly believable characters. On the whole, though, this is mindless action fare that most people will hate.
Wait, I'm not finished. I didn't hate it. I was entertained. I'm not a fan of the games and have never even played one, but I still enjoyed this. If you're looking for pure entertainment and pulse-pounding action, look no further.
The movie begins in the Hive, an underground research facility, where the employees' day is somewhat ruined when the doors seal themselves and poisonous gas gushes from the walls. So much for them. Cut to: Alice (Jovovich) waking up in a deserted mansion with no memory of who she is or how she got here. Before she has time to get over last night's hangover, all heck breaks loose and she ends up down in the Hive with an eco-warrior (Mabius), a fellow amnesiac (Purefoy) and a bunch of military commandos (Rodriguez, Crewes, Salmon, and some highly expendable extras for added flavor). Their mission is to kill the sentient computer running the hive, but first they have to contend with the dead employees, who are back as hungry zombies, thanks to a nasty genetic virus. Throw in some undead dogs, rounds and rounds of gunfire, a killer computer, security lasers, a heavy metal soundtrack, and ""The Licker"" (don't even ask), and you've got yourself a gripping action flick.
There is nothing I can say in this movie's favor. I could say, ""Why is it that Rodriguez yells 'we're running out of ammo!' near the beginning of the movie, but no one ever actually runs out of ammo?"" I could say, ""Zombie dogs? They just look like a bunch of dobermans who rolled in Black Forest cake!"" I could say, ""I don't care if you loved him! He's a bloody ZOMBIE! Wipe that shocked, tragic look off your face and RUN!"" I could say, ""What were these people paid to be in this film and will they ever live it down?""
But I won't. Despite all its flaws, I enjoyed this movie. In terms of gripping action and terror, it delivers. If there's a sequel -- and you KNOW there's gonna be a sequel -- I plan to see it. So shoot me. Because you know I'll come back to get you.",4.0
"I'm a BIG fan of the Resident Evil games,so I was very much looking forward to seeing the film. Of course,movies are rarely as good as the original material,be it a game or a book. So I was prepared to hate the movie. I didn't. As an action movie,it's quite good (although the music was loud and annoying).It didn't have much in the way of horror in it; unlike the games,it didn't scare me all that much. So if you keep your expectations low in comparing it to the games,it's an enjoyable enough action flick.
I really wanted to give it a 3 1/2 stars,as it's not really THAT good,but so be it...",4.0
"This film is a brilliantly ambiguous look at France's greatest hero, leaving the audience to come to grips with her drives and actions as well as political interferance crossing patriotism with religion.  Beautifully  directed, an amazingly beleivable performance by Jonovich and its really  good to see Dustin Hoffman as a manifestation of the Devil's Advocate.",4.0
"I realize that everyone keeps comparing this to Braveheart...why? This is a totally different story. Jovovich did a spectacular job of portraying Joan. She was innocent and pure, yet crazed and wild. It was extremely  refreshing to see a woman warrior for a change and she pulled it off  amazingly. The movie was a bit dry in spots but honestly the ending was  worth the wait. Unlike the opinions of some others...I thought Hoffman was  brilliant...finally a portrayal of god with a touch of darkness. He makes  you fear him to some subtle extent. I was glad to see God shown in a shade  of grey as opposed to the always white and graceful appearance in most  films. I believe that this movie raises alot of questions as to how Joan of  Arc was deemed a Saint, if this enactment is accuate..and who knows...maybe  she wasn't as blessed as believed. I like movies that make you ask  questions and think. This movie did that for me.",4.0
"For those not familiar with the real life story of Joan of Arc, and to be to the point she was THE girl who saved France from the English in 1431, and later she got captured and burned by the English. This film is based on  her life story and how she became the saviour of her country in the time of  crisis, The film start of when Joan (played by Milla Jovovich) is young and  for the next half and hour, you get to understand how Joan did what she did  later in the film. The middle section of the film involves 2 different  battle scenes, they are good, but not on the same league as Braveheart. The  last section of the film deals with Joan's trial by the English.  This film  is well put together by Luc Besson who also directed the Fifth Element and  Leon, the cinematography is great, the costume and backdrop are faithful to  the 15th century.
Milla Jovovich does a wonderful job in performing  Joan, she show the character's struggle against the non-believers  beautifully, other actors like John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman also  shines in their part, Faye Dunaway is also brilliant in this film as the  mother in law of the King.
Although the fighting sequence is not as long  and as many as Braveheart, it does hold it's own. If you are looking for a  film on the line of Braveheart, then you are on the right track, but this  film deal a lot more in terms of the character Joan's emotion and struggle  more towards the end than expected, but as a whole you won't be  disappointed.",4.0
I like this move very much.  I think that war should be shown as the brutal thing that it is and not made to look pretty or glamorous.  But I especially enjoyed the scenes with Dustin Hoffman.  I thought it was a  pretty good depiction of the inner struggle that a spiritual person can go  through.,4.0
"I'm not sure why people have been giving this movie such low ratings.  I highly recommend the DVD version.  The artistic effects were absolutely brilliant!  Although the story tends to drag on at times and the acting  could have been better,  I believe it is worth watching.  I'd rent it  before buying it.",4.0
"Oh-KAY!  Resident Evil got a little more hardcore and bleak than I was prepared for, but that's a good thing.  I was expecting a mediocre, derivative action movie where I'd be able to predict every single shock and plot twist, with maybe a few cool money shots or zombie gore thrown in that made it worth a rental (I'm a sucker for zombies).  If you'd told me before I saw it that I'd be giving it 4 stars afterwards, I probably would have laughed. I ain't laughing now.
I can't compare the game to the movie that well, since I've only played the game once or twice in the arcade and didn't last very long before I got eaten. (Check the trivia section on the IMDB if you want more info on that, though beware of many spoilers) I don't know if the game has any more of a backstory than the DVD box did: a virus is accidentally unleashed at an underground biological research facility that turns all the employees, lab animals, and experiments into flesh-eating undead. A rescue team discovers too late they are stuck in there with them; they have 3 hours to get out without getting eaten or, worse, infected  before the `Red Queen' master computer permanently shuts down all the exits.
On the negative side, it was a little longer than an action movie needs to be-- 10 minutes could have been trimmed, I caught myself wanting to hit forward and skip scenes in the first half hour of people wandering warily around deserted areas. I've never wanted to do that with a Romero movie. It does take a little too long to get going, but when the action kicks in, trust me, it doesn't let up, to the point where I felt kind of battered after the movie-- really unrelenting. I couldn't stand the industrial/techno soundtrack, but then I don't usually listen to bands with song titles like `Fistf*ck"" and ""My Plague (New Abuse Mix)"". I guess it was appropriate for the movie;  I didn't exactly expect, say, Oingo Boingo (though that would have been kind of cool, now that I think of it) but it was grating after a while. Several shots were extremely derivative of Romero, but since I haven't watched the featurettes or commentaries, I'm not sure if the filmmakers intended them as a tribute/in-joke (like the newspaper headline blowing around a deserted street proclaiming THE DEAD WALK!  which, as far as I'm concerned, should earn a movie 3 stars right there) or just ripped them off with the plan to say they were `inspired by' the other movie if anyone pointed out the similarities.
The end seemed to be setting up for a sequel (according to the IMDB, one is planned but not even in pre-production), though at least not in an extremely cliched way, and it mainly irritated me because it was a cliffhanger. There's also several CGI shots where the monster looks about as realistic as the one in the actual game; I did not for a moment forget I was watching CGI, and it was VERY easy to tell where the animatronics ended and the CGI began. Oh, and terrible tagline, at least on the poster art (""Survive the horror""?  C'mon, marketing team, you can try a little harder).
OK, enough of what didn't work. On the plus side, Milla Jovovich has proven herself to be one of the few genuinely talented model-turned-actresses, and gives a great performance. I was kind of disappointed in Michelle Rodriguez's acting, mainly because she was so good in Girlfight, but she was acceptable and at least can really look like a badass. There's quite a few fun--and sick--shots. There were plot twists that I actually didn't see coming--sorry to say, I could see most of the jumps walking up 5th Avenue-- and the plot was a lot more brutal and downbeat than I expected (for a movie based on a video game, and for a modern zombie movie, anyway)--good for them. They did definitely outright steal some ideas from Dawn of the Dead (and, as everybody has already probably pointed out, Cube) but at least had some originality by putting a slightly new twist on them. There was a much higher body count than I thought (not counting all the zombie employees, of course, I mean among the heroes), most of which was pretty b-llsy. Characters did not die in the order I expected them to. Things got pretty cold-blooded (so to speak).
I'd recommend it for a rental, if you want a mindless, scary action movie with some real suspense. Big fans of the game, it's probably a good investment to purchase (though I'm sure everyone that was going to buy it did so a long time ago) . You could do a lot worse (like rent the director's Mortal Kombat, for instance) Bonus/deleted/alternate scenes, and easter eggs (yes, you can stop hunting for them now), are conspicuously absent on the DVD, which leads me to believe the talk about releasing a 2 disc set a few months down the line of an `unrated director's cut'.  I'll rent that to see that extra gore (hey, I ain't above that, and I'll gladly admit to it), and I wouldn't mind seeing the flick again, either.
Not bad at all for a mainstream studio movie based on a game.",4.0
"An enjoyable piece of horror-b-style film. Fantastic scenes and a nearly beautiful rendition of the video game. Although it may lack nearly many of the things that make the game, those who played this on playstation will take note of the more important things: kicking zombie ..., the unoriginal storyline, and the sure stopping end scene of what's to come. I personally loved it and not ashamed to admit it fits in the classic slots of films to see during a halloween fest. So invite your friends and get ready for some good old fashioned ... kicking-gun toting action.",4.0
"I wasn't expecting to much from this flick, Boy was I wrong the story was excellent and the way they used the monsters and zombie's was great, they didn't try to just fill the movie with blood and gore, the story they told was well thought out.  The ending awesome, left me wanting more and I really hope they make a second part.  It's a combination of all 4 video games and mixes really well.  Unlike video games turned movie's ( Street Fighter, Mortal Comabt and Tomb Raider) of the past this one is a keeper.",4.0
"I enjoyed this film every much.  It moved slow at times.  BUt the war sences are very good.  Luc Besson doesn't go all out in his usal ways.  But the set's, customs, and other things every good.

But the ""Fifth Element"" didn't get any awards ether.  But I think you people should see it.  You may or may not like it.  But  thats good because we are all different.  This is a strong Film.

"If looked from a historical point of view, the movie has little to offer. But if you want to see some Middle Ages action flick, it's almost as good as it can get thanks to incredible battle scenes. As one reviewer noted  before, it's on par with those seen in Braveheart. Movie is a bit too long  and sometimes I though they should have skipped some parts, esspecially  after Joan was taken prisoner. Overall, a decent action movie on a  historical theme that is fun to watch. But if the history is what you are  looking for, my best advise is to look somewhere else.",4.0
"The Genera of zombie movies has had many cogs in its wheel.  For example Day of the Dead, Night of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the living dead and so on.  Resident Evil proves that this formula can still work for an audience in the 21st century.  The biggest fault of this movie is what it doesn't use.
These include 90% of the cast and its soundtrack.  It is a wonderful B movie and if it's a choice between this and Pearl Harbor rent Resident Evil.  I personally can't wait for the sequel",4.0
"RESIDENT EVIL was a great Capcom videogame (with many successful versions) with a very simple plot: someone must do something in order to solve a mystery. In this basic outline, the character must cross many different spaces (each has its obstacles) and accomplish smaller missions, that help him to gather objects that lead to peaces of information leading to a final confrontation. Period.
The good thing is that the adaptation for Cinema of that basic game structure is reasonably well made. The result is this: a group of top-soldiers is sent inside a secret corporate lab complex where a lethal virus has been spread. They have a few hours to a) discover what happened, b) disable and neutralize the virus and c) get out.
Like the game, the complications rearrange the order of priorities and the journey is constantly being redesigned according to the new obstacles found. Like the game, some characters have secret agendas and everything leads to the high-powered action confrontation scene.
Put like this, it all seems cerebral, but don't missunderstand me: the film is very entertaining! If the story/screenplay design is (in this case) simple, it is because film is not for the cinemateque. It is pure (and good!) fun. It has a lot of rhythm, the cast is appealing, the characters are fine (in their game-like dimension) and the action makes you jump.
Even if you do not play the game (or even know nothing about it) you will understand it perfectly for the screenplay was designed for a wider audience. In this sense, the film is constructed so you'll get early on all the information that you need for the rest of the film.
I liked it very much and I believe this to be the best game-to-film adaptation ever made. It works even for those who did not play the game and it delivers a simple plot with lots of interesting twists and great action scenes.
The ending is begging for a sequel (but you know that already) and - I have to admit - it is a great ending (and it alone worths the whole film!). Great art direction (doesn't have much to do with the game). Good soundtrack.
The extras are fine and they're mostly on the technical side (why wouldn't they be?). Milla Jovovich is absolutely beautiful. Despite the fact that we are dealing here with game characters, I do think that Milla gives a great performance. Furthermore, I do think she is capable of taking higher flights in the future. Aside of that, she is someone the camera trully loves.

"If you've seen movies like ""Alien"" + it's sequels, movies like Predator or other SciFi-Action-Horror-Comedy movies the story of this one won't come to you as a surprise.
A team of military guys enter a secret facility to ""save the world"". People die, only few make it out alive.
I found the element of amnesia of one of the main charakters (Alice) interesting. Though this element has been used many times in other movies it nevertheless keeps the movie interesting, as Alice tries to find out who she is, what she did in the past and why she did it.
So what else is to say about a movie featuring a basic story that has been told many times before?
To enjoy the movie (any movie like that) you have to focus on other elements that make a movie, which mainly would be the ""how is the story told"", and I think the way this story is told is worth 2 stars. Esp. since the movie is not trying to be funny or too entertaining (which I really hate about horror movies).
If a movie intends to scare (regardless how cheap the scares are) comic relief is always misplaced.
Worth mentioning is, that the AI is not the usual [bad]-software that simply goes berzerk, or follows a plan of it's own or wants to rule the world. The AI most of the time in this movie makes sense and is simply doing what it was programmed to do.
The rest is action and suspense. Predictable sometimes, but who cares. People who want to be amused by a movie should watch comedy, not horror. People who want movies to make sense should watch the news (even that doesn't always make sense) and not action-horror-suspense movies.",4.0

"If you are a die-hard fan of the RE video game series, you might be a bit let down.  In the whole movie, there are only a handful of items and instances where you will go ""Ah...that I know"".  Seeing this movie with the video game in mind might disappoint you.
But as an action movie, it's up there with the best of the I've-got-some-time-to-kill-and-feel-like-watching-some-action-movie genre.  That's the situation I was under when I watched this movie.  Must say, I was thoroughly enjoying this movie.  Didn't really care that the plot was thin.  Didn't give a damn I didn't see any recognizable characters from the game (which I've played).  I saw a damn good action movie!
And that's what this is...a damn good action movie!
Rent it or buy it.  It'll give you 90 minutes of good ole action movie fun.",4.0
"Surely the best of the movies based on computer games. I guess it did help that the game actually had something resembling a plot (unlike ""Street Fighter"", ""Mortal Combat"", ""Mario Bros."" etc).
Cool fx's, a serious amount of fighting and Milla nekkid really makes this worth 90 minutes of your life.",4.0
"For anyone who has the strategy guide to the new GameCube edition of the original Resident Evil game, you'll find that the development team of RE has called this movie a good ""trailer"" (whatever that means) and that Milla Jovovich did a good job with it. This leads me to believe that Capcom isn't overly happy with the end result. Who cares...it's solid in it's own right and doesn't pretend to be the game, but rest assured it is well based upon the concept of the game franchise, maybe more in spirit than actual application and a welcome addition.
Of the horror films that have come out in recent years, excluding Hollywood smashes such as ""The Sixth Sense,"" or ""The Others,"" and so on. ""Resident Evil"" happens to be the best, more intelligent than ""Jason X,"" and the last 2 ""Alien"" movies.
The movie begins with a very familiar concept to the hardcore RE gamers. The breakout of the virus, S.T.A.R.S. team infiltration, and so on. I don't feel the need to rewrite the synopsis of the movie, which you can get from the Official movie website and Amazon's own review. What I am going to say is that there's plenty of action, gore, mutated zombies, zombie-dogs and so on. Milla Jovovich will keep keep you enthralled herself, I guess that's reason enough for men to see it, ya? The ""Red Queen"" is the eeriest thing in the movie, ""You're all going to die here."" Not an original line, but the visual and tone of her/it is quite enough to give you the chills. I recommend watching the movie to find out what the ""Red Queen"" is. To me that was a reason to stay in my seat and be thankful that there were other people in the theater. The DVD is a hit, sharp, crisp, and chillingly Gothic. All the things I love.
I gave it 4 stars because I wanted a game controller. No I didn't, believed that didn't you? The reason I left one star of is because the movie is shorter than what it could be, even though it doesn't appear that way when watching it. All thing's being equal, well that's a crock line, but who cares, ya? If you're a horror fanatic, or like the occasional, twisted and demented scare, this one's a good choice. <P...",4.0
"PAL JOEY had two revivals before the movie was made, but that was not enough for producers who decided to remove many songs from the original production and made a singer out of JOEY who was a dancer. Still ,who can resist FRANK SINATRA singing THE LADY IS A TRAMP,I COULD WRITE A BOOK and I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS in his own unique way?After all these years it remains a top movie enternainment, and like FRANK used to say when he changed a lyric to the consternation of mister RODGERS ,broads won't do the dishes in earmans and pearls or maybe i just made that up. It's fascinating how FRANK could get away with this, but let's not forget that the league of feminists wasn't too strong then.",4.0

"First of all, let me say that I had a preconceived opinion about this movie before I saw it.  Being a hardcore fan, I thought it would go the way of Super Mario Bros.  Much to my surprise, however, the movie turned out to be less a cold attempt to make quick cash then a proper tribute by real fans, as well as a fun ride.  Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a woman who is suddenly sucked into a mission to infiltrate an underground lab called the Hive, which has mysteriously killed its inhabitants.  Unknown to Alice, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), and the rest of the crew, everyone down there is now a flesh-craving zombie.  It's not deep entertainment, but it's fun as anything.  Just rating the movie, I'd have to give it five stars, for a movie which gives a fan like me everything he wants (including Milla in minimal garb, but I digress).
My rating takes its one star plunge when the DVD itself is analyzed.  Most of the extras are just fine.  The French students among us can listen to it dubbed or subbed in Francais.  You can watch it in widescreen, and you can check out the filmographies of five members of the staff.  It also contains a music video for ""My Plague"" by Slipknot.  I wasn't interested in this video, but that's just because I'm not a fan of Slipknot.  It's all about taste in that department.  The trailer section, however, pulls my least favorite of tricks.  Instead of offering the many different tv spots, teasers, and trailers, it offers you one trailer for ""RE"" and four more trailers of random other movies.  But this is just a pet peeve.
The real clincher for me that decided its three star rating was the commentary.  It presents the situation of four (the most I've ever heard) people in a room: Milla, Michelle, producer Jeremy Bolt, and director Paul W.S. Anderson.  Because of this turmoil, the commentary plays like having four people behind you at the theater: three film students, and their ditzy blonde friend, with Milla playing the part of the latter.  I loved her as Leeloo, and I think she's an accomplished and attractive actress, but damn, is she annoying.  The commentary rarely answers any questions that the viewer might have about the film, and when the director or producer is about to, Milla typically interrupts to talk about her topless scene, or something else trivial.
On the lighter side, the commentary does provide some fun moments.  It becomes clear after twenty minutes that all four are devoted to the video game series, and Michelle sounds like a die-hard fan of my own caliber, spouting reference after reference.  Also, it's kind of funny when they go off on tangents.  There's a hilarious moment when Milla and Michelle are arguing about one aspect of the movie, while at the same time, Paul and Jeremy argue about the music of the film.  It's obvious that they don't take the commentary too seriously, and they apologize for it routinely, and inform you that the real answers will be given in the production designer's commentary.  Unfortunately, this commentary doesn't exist.
All in all, I gave the DVD 3 stars, and the movie 5, which obviously averaged out to 4.  If you want a good horror or sci-fi flick, or are a big fan of the video game series, this DVD is just right for you, and it's not too expensive either.  Otherwise, you might want to just stick with a rental.",4.0
"I love horror movies, but I'll have to admit, coming into this one I was not expecting a great movie.  I mean, come on, what video game turned movie ever is.  From the previews, it look as if there were barely any zombies and most of the monsters were the zombie dogs, a computerized girl, or Nemesis.  After viewing the trailer, I was dissapointed b/c, quite frankly, the zombies are the scariest part.  I am glad to say that I was pleasantly suprised.  The movie was great, the acting was wonderful, and there were more zombies than I could shake an machine gun at.  I went with my wife to see this and I swear, she spent most of the movie with her head buried in my arm, and she doesnt scare easily.  The only downside to the movie was that the beginning was a bit confusing, but it all makes since as time goes on.  If you like to be scared and on the edge of your seat, this movie is for you.  But don't go into it comparing it to the video game, because as you have probably already read, its not like the game.  Just forget the game even exist and view this title as just an A+, action packed horror movie.  No, RE fans, its not like the game......its better!",4.0
"I avoided this at all costs at first, thinking that it would be horrible beyond belief.  I began to become intrigued when I learned Paul Anderson made it, because of the fun unpredictability and B movie charm of Event Horizon.  I enjoyed this one more.
As pure enjoyable trash, this movie is to savored over many times.  While I cringe at buying from Sony (because a Superbit DVD will likely follow), I was pleased with the picture and sound.  I hoped that there was an uncut version out there (it SHOULD have a rated X for violence version), but no deleated scenes were included, so I am unsure.
With fewer horror filming coming out, I am looking forward to Resident Evil 2 next fourth of July.",4.0
"Resident Evil is one of those films that I said, ""Ah, I'll wait until it gets to video to see it.""  I didn't expect it to be any good - not really.  How could it be?  It is based on a video game.  Now, I actually liked Mortal Kombat, which is also based on a video game (it wasn't great, but it was fun) - and I didn't know that the same director was responsible for it.  So, I was expecting the worst.  I was wrong.
As someone completely unfamiliar with the video game on which the film is based, I didn't know what to expect.  In short, Resident Evil is about a group of ""security"" personnel who work for a huge conglomerate that is doing all sorts of research - some of it suspect.  One of their more sinister viruses is released and they must go into the secret facility where it is created to try to fix things.  Little do they know that they will be facing all sorts of creepy security devices and ... zombies.
Milla Jovovich is the female lead and she manages to carry the film well.  I'm really not that informed on her background, but I will say that while she probably doesn't have a great depth of talent at her disposal, she is a capable actress and I liked her in her role.  To say that she was believable would be impossible, as I don't know that such a person could exist (how many zombie fighters do you know?).
Sadly, the men in this film are almost interchangeable.  I really didn't know who was who until names started getting fired off and I actually bothered to pay attention.  They all sort of look the same.  There are two other women in the film too, and I didn't realize it until one of them gets injured - they look the same as well.
The interesting thing in this sci-fi/horror film is that the horror aspects were not the ones I found frightening.  It was the sci-fi stuff.  The whole zombie aspect seems to be ground better covered by George Romero in Dawn of the Dead.  In fact, the zombie mythos seems to be taken directly from Romero's film:  they move slowly, they look terrible, and they eat flesh of the living.  If you get bitten, scratched, etc. by one of the undead, you, too, will become one of the undead.
The sci-fi angle worked better for me (and I don't really like sci-fi).  I found the security devices and the assorted set pieces to be very intimidating and frightening.  I definitely was feeling the suspense.
Part of the fun for me was that I DIDN'T know about the video game.  Why? I didn't know what was going on.  The beginning of the film was very confusing as I didn't understand what was happening or why it was happening.  Fortunately, the screenwriters did a very good job of having a few of the characters actually explain the subject to me - and it was done well - as a few of the other characters were designed to be as confused as I was.
The script, the sets, the make-up, and the actors made this a very enjoyably scary film.  I actually recommend it and give it four stars when compared with other films of this genre.
The DVD extra features are rather standard and I didn't avail myself of all of them.  However, as DVD extras become the norm, I think we'll see more and more added features for big budget films and more of the ""standard fare"" extras, such as these, offered:  Director and actor commentary, subtitles, music video, biographies of the actors, etc.
Have yourself a good scare and watch this film.",4.0
"A Zombie film with no gore?...surely not!!
However, it almost works...almost. Paul Andersons not done too bad a job with it considering i thought they were gonna turn it into a pg13 when Romero left the production, but far too many movies have been pillaged in it (Matrix, Dawn of the Dead, Aliens, Cube) so if you seen any of these films youll be seeing the same thing but in a slightly different way.  Acting is occasionally dodgy but bearable.  Overall a good film, if you're a fan of RE of course.  Sequel should be better.",4.0
"It's so refreshing to see a horror movie that actually takes itself seriously. I'm old enough to remember when scary movies actually believed they could frighten you and not show their insecurities through self-parody. The closest movie I can remember to this one is Aliens by James Cameron, in which the action takes turns with fear.
Of course, this movie is based on the video-game series which I know only by reputation. Probably one of the reasons behind the movie is a marketing one, which works, because now I want to play the game.
In the world of Resident Evil, the world's largest corporation is secretly conducting genetic experiments and developing biological weapons. A problem develops when one of these biological weapons, called the T-virus, is released in one of the company's underground labs. The lab, called The Hive, is controlled by a super computer called The Red Queen. She kills all the employees in one manner or another in order to contain the virus. A team of paramilitary soldiers is sent in to shut her down, not knowing that they will release zombies who have a taste for living flesh. Milla Javovich plays a soldier who guards the entrance to The Hive, and due to her proximity to the lab, was knocked out by nerve gas, and has lost her memory.
I really liked this movie. It reminds me very much of the George Romero movies, but with more style and more of a budget. There are a lot of frightening moments. You don't ever get a tongue-in-cheek comment or a moment of goofiness that you see in Wes Craven movies. In fact, what horror director can you name these days besides him? It's pretty sad about the poor lack of quality AND quantity in horror. Witness the idiocy of the new Halloween movie, or Jason X. They would make Ed Wood roll in his grave. Resident Evil is grim, gruesome, bloody, apocalyptic, sad, brutal, entertaining, and invigorating. The look of it is  beautiful, lots of greys, blacks, and whites, with Milla's red dress of blood flashing through it all.
The director, Paul W.S. Anderson, has really outdone himself with this film. It moves and pulses and oozes, and creeps around you. This is greatly helped by the soundtrack recorded by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. I really liked the Alice in Wonderland references. That's how you feel, as though you're in the land of the videogame, where only it has any reality. Anderson shows us what John Carpenter or George Romero could have become instead of sinking into obscurity and B-movies.
Now, for the DVD quality. The picture is beautiful and the menacing ambience of keyboards and guitar is really good. It features 5 short featurettes: ""The Making of Resident Evil"", ""Scoring"", ""Costumes"", ""set Design"", and ""Zombie Make-up Tests"". The making of the score is interesting because we find out that Marilyn Manson is actually a pretty intelligent guy.....uh, girl.....uh whatever. It also includes a video from the Black Sabbath/Texas Chainsaw Massacre band Slipknot, if that means anything to you.
Something pretty disappointing about the DVD is the movie commentary. It features Milla Javovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Producer Jeremy Bolt, and Paul Anderson. It's disappointing because everytime the two filmmakers start to discuss something interesting in the movie, Milla comes in and interjects ""nobody cares about that"" or ""that's not very interesting"" and goes into some rambling that has nothing to do with the film. In fact, at the beginning, it seems as if Milla doesn't even know what a commentary is: ""you mean we're going to comment on the whole movie?"" She comes across as an immature valley girl. You can always just never listen to it.

This was a playfully nasty little bit of fun, meant to give you a little thrill, and a few smiles, too.

"I dogged on Frank Sinatra before for his stilted performance in `Some Came Running' and was somewhat lambasted for it.  While settling in to watch `Pal Joey' I was envisioning a repeat.  What can I say?  I actually really liked his performance here.  He possessed a coolness and a well-rounded edge that elevated his character and created something believable.  He had those moments of restraint and introverted emotion and yet he balanced it out with a simple charm that was genuine and engaging.

In `Pal Joey', George Sidney's 1957 musical, Sinatra plays a crooner out of luck until he lucks into a gig that lands him a chance to charm a wealthy widow into giving him his own club.  The only problem is that that widow is jealous of his attention and tries to put a wedge between Joey and his budding romance with one of the showgirls.

Sinatra is great here.  He carries the film on his shoulders and delivers a fine performance.  Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak give him a run for his money though, especially Hayworth who ravishes in her last screen performance.  She is intoxicating and sensual and possesses a true sense of power.  Novak comes off a tad stiff in some scenes, especially the early ones, but as the film progresses she gets more comfortable in her performance and truly delivers.  Her take on `My Funny Valentine' is remarkable and possibly the best moment in the film.  The form a cohesive threesome and create some serious charm.  Novak is also a solidified knockout in the film and is, as she puts it, ""stacked"".

`Pal Joey' is predictable yet fun and it is pretty to look at with lavish sets and some great costume design (the use of color in particular is wonderful).  It's a nicely done musical with talent to spare.",4.0
"This film was a lot better than I expected it to be. From the previews I expected a bloodier version of Tomb Raider. I was wrong. I have never played the game, or even seen it up close, but I must say that it was one of the better video game-to-movie adaptations I have seen to date. This one had an interesting plot unlike the ""Mortal Kombat"" style of video game movies in which everything from the game is attempted to be squeezed into the film and therefore some items are left out, including a plot sometimes.
The beginning is a little confusing, with everything going on at once. But after everything settles down and all is explained, the movie gets much better. The special effects were quite good, and the acting was convincing too, especially Jovovich and Rodriguez.
Maybe I was just dazzled by the film being better than my expectations, but I was entertained. I watched this film in a room full of people who were all interested by the end. So obviously I wasn't the only one.",4.0
"When you hear that Hollywood is turning your favorite video game into a big-budget movie, normally you'd get pretty nervous. Just look at what happened to Mortal Kombat (Mortal-what?). Times change, however, and Resident Evil is by far one of the best video game to film transfers to date.
The story follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) as she wakes up in a shower. . .
Paul Anderson does a great job of making zombies scary again and uses any CGI to enhance the film instead of degrate it. The action scenes are well done and the story telling is quick paced with a sense of dread through out. The acting is top notch-even though some characters are about as cliched as you get. It's a fun movie for fans of the game or just horror fans in general. Definately worth checking out.",4.0

"PAL JOEY is a slick 1957 Columbia production of a popular `40s Broadway musical featuring a great Richard Rodgers-Lorenz Hart score.

I saw the musical on-stage at Goodspeed Opera House (in beautiful East Haddam, Ct.) a few years back in a revival that approximated the original Broadway show. The lead character - an aspiring dancer - wasn't particularly pleasant or sympathetic, using women as a tool to climb the ladder to success, making for a show that was atypical for its time.

When it came time to produce the movie some years later, changes were understandably made to John O'Hara's original stories (first published in the New Yorker), especially once it became a vehicle for Frank Sinatra. Joey was now an aspiring singer instead of a hoofer, and while Sidney's film retains enough of its source material's feel so that Joey isn't exactly a kind soul to the opposite sex, it's been softened to a degree where its protagonist is more of a rascal than an unabashed jerk.

It's a change for the better in terms of this 1957 film, which isn't a classic (Joey's plight still isn't particularly compelling, despite the alterations), but nevertheless comes to life whenever one of Rodgers and Hart's songs appear on the soundtrack: ""The Lady is a Tramp,"" ""I Could Write a Book,"" and ""My Funny Valentine"" are just a few of the duo's classic songs crooned by Sinatra and the vocal stand-ins for co-stars Rita Hayworth (as a former stripper who enables Joey to run his own night club) and Kim Novak (as the ""good"" chorus girl who tries in vain to reform Joey's ways). As Julie Kirgo points out, some of the songs aren't from ""Pal Joey"" but other Rogers-Hart shows including ""On Your Toes"" and ""Babes in Arms"" among others, but they help to augment a film version, scripted by Dorothy Kingsley, that's dated in its own way.

In addition to a lovely AVC encoded 1080p transfer culled from the Sony vaults, Twilight Time's Blu-Ray offers a wonderful 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack that enhances the outstanding musical direction of Nelson Riddle and George Duning. The original trailer and a nice, albeit brief, ten-minute featurette on Novak off-screen circa 2010 round out another terrific TT release.",4.0
"I personally loved the movie.  The computer effects where wonderful, and the greatly talented Milla Jovovich brought so much to the movie.  I was stunned when I saw people walking out of the theater, and complaining about it outside the theater.  I agree, the zombies where laughable, but aren't all zombies?  I have never seen one zombie movie that has scared me.  Infact, my friends and I often rent zombie movies to laugh at them.  How can a rotting corpse with no brain, stummbling about and making odd groaning noises not be funny?  But, back to Resident Evil, there was a good story line, the emotions were fully felt, plus great gore.  What more could you want in a movie?  Im just hopeing there will be a sequel, (judgeing by the ending scene).",4.0
"Excellent movie altogether.  Nice storyline, character developement.  I was on the edge of my seat as I watched this movie in the theatre even after the 4th time.  Yes, I saw it 4 times in the theatre.  What can I say?  I loved this one.  And what really surprised me was how clean and tame it was.  Granted there were some gross scenes but I was expecting all-out gory-bloody messes left and right like the movie.  So I was very impressed by that.
Why did I give it only 4 stars you ask?  Well for two reasons:  One, the director totally strayed from the video game story line.  And this movie was mainly bent on the pleasing the fan boys.  And nothing makes a fan boy more mad than straying from the game storyline.  And seccond:  All the Milla fanboy pleasing scenes were not needed at all.  I got a little disturbed in the end when she was wearing that lovely hospital gown.
But don't let that stop you from purchasing this great movie.  It's good none the less.",4.0
"The recent Broadway revival of Pal Joey is a stark contrast to the film version which drastically overhauled the story and song list, mostly for the better. Frank Sinatra plays Joey as a cad with a heart of gold, who you know will do the right thing in the end. Getting to that point, you have to put up with Frank's 1950-ish hipster persona, which by todays standards produces quite a few cringes in his attitude towards women. Getting past that, the movie has widely added several great Rodgers and Hart songs from their other musicals, including one of Frank's signature numbers, ""The Lady is a Tramp."" The music alone makes it worthwhile to watch.
  The location has been moved to San Francisco, and the location footage is another pleasant change from the play's dreary Chicago setting. The characters have also been altered, becoming less caustic on the one side, as with Joey, and even sweeter on the other side, as with Kim Novak. Having seen the Broadway version, and concluding that the greatest fault of the show was the inability to like the main characters, the changes here work for the best.

I don't know if Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak did their own singing, but since most of the songs are performed by the incomparable Sinatra, you are sure to be humming several of the tunes for days afterwards.",4.0
"Pal Joey is thoroughly delightful.  I'd forgotten just how much.  Even though my favorite song comes from this movie, Frank Sinatra was much too old and didn't have Eddie Fisher's looks for an EF fanclub president like little old me.  I certainly thought he was taller (like Michael Feinstein, big talent comes in short people); after all, he was already a star in the entertainment business and movies, not just on television.  Though he was not 'bewitching,' he was a bundle of talent and versitility with lots of media attention and some gorgeous ex-wives.

To think that Hitch's blonde in ""Vertigo"" had music in her veins, Kim Novack was a good foil for Sinatra's antics on and off stage.  But it took Rita Hayworth to put him in his place.  She was the star from Knob Hill.

Watch and see how good the musicals were fifty years ago and see Sinatra at his best.  Thanks to Carlos (not Mark), it was later that I learned to appreciate Frank's perfect enunciation as I aided in his quest for perfect English.  No one since has come close to him with the exception of Feinstein, who so graciously sang 'But Not for Me,' a Gershwin song, to me in Nashville.  What a night!",4.0
"As other reviewers have noted, Frank Sinatra was at the top of his form when he starred in PAL JOEY, the film version of the celebrated Rodgers and Hart musical (originally staged on Broadway in 1940 starring Gene Kelly).

Based around the cynical short stories of John O'Hara, PAL JOEY is the story of womanising nightclub entertainer Joey Evans (Sinatra) and his various affairs, most notably with Mrs Simpson (Rita Hayworth), a widowed millionairess trying to escape her past as a stripper; and Linda English (Kim Novak), a naive showgirl whose heart is stolen by the caddish Joey.

The main reason why PAL JOEY works so well is the delicious score, which includes ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"", ""I Could Write a Book"", ""Zip"", and ""That Terrific Rainbow"".  Orchestrated by Sinatra's frequent musical collaborator Nelson Riddle, the film version of PAL JOEY also interpolates several more Rodgers & Hart standards into the score (""My Funny Valentine"", ""There's a Small Hotel"", ""The Lady is a Tramp"").

Rita Hayworth (in what turned out to be the final movie under her Columbia contract) exudes lots of steamy, repressed sensuality with her performance as the widowed society dame taken in by Joey's charms; and in a rare musical role, Kim Novak dazzles.  Frank Sinatra, with trademark raincoat and jaunty hat, is his charming best as lady-killer Joey.  Look out for talented Barbara Nichols among the showgirls.

The DVD for PAL JOEY sadly doesn't have much in the way of bonus materials, just a trailer and some talent profiles for it's main stars and director George Sidney.  Still, for musical fans this is quite the treat.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",4.0
"Despite its Broadway success, Pal Joey took his time reaching the screen. Gene Kelly came to fame in the title role in the original Broadway production of Pal Joey and was the logical first choice for the screen version but when MGM would not lend him out the project sat on the backburner so long that his intended co-star Rita Hayworth swapped female roles to play the older woman who bankrolls Joey's club - on her terms - by the time the film finally reached the screen in 1957.

One of the few Columbia musicals that creates some of its own magic rather than trying to copy the RKO and MGM formula, Sinatra is so perfect as John O'Hara's heel that it is now impossible to imagine Kelly in the role. Not all of the Rodgers and Hart's songs are well served - some, such as I Didn't Know What Time It Was, are all but thrown away - but the score is a strong one (The Lady Is A Tramp, Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered, If They Asked Me I Could Write A Book ) and the film is one of the few successful Broadway-to-screen transfers of its day. Great dog too.

The only real extra on the DVD is the original five-minute trailer, but it's a gem. Filmed on the film's set, with Sinatra introducing us to Joey's vocabulary with the aid of a blackboard and ruler, it's terrific fun and a genuine collector's item! Thankfully that's included on Twilight Time's excellent limited edition Blu-ray release along with a featurette Backstage with Kim Novak, an isolated score track and a booklet, as well as superior picture quality.",4.0

"Having long been familiar with both theatrical and soundtrack recordings of ""Pal Joey"" I felt I was past due to view the movie. First and foremost pointing out that the film is dated would be a totally unwarranted and unjustified point. This film holds up well even after 50+ years. Some feel that Gene Kelly should have reprised his Broadway role in the movie but had Sinatra not been the force that he was it is highly likely that the movie itself would have never been made. Production values are maybe a bit below what I would have expected for a feature musical of the period but certainly there is nothing here to complain about. Sinatra is in fine voice with maybe the definative reading of ""Lady is a Tramp"", Hayworth for me was perfect, at least until the dream sequence just prior to the end of the film and Novak might have slighly unplayed her role but was quite beautiful and an excellent choice for the role. What others have failed to point out is that neither Hayworth nor Novak did their own singing. Jo Anne Greer was the wonderful singer of ""ZIP"" & ""Bewitched"" both credited to Hayworth's character while Judy Erwin handled Novak's vocals including ""My Funny Valentine"". (Trivia note: Rita Hayworth's ""Put the Blame on Mame"" from the movie ""Glida"" was actually song by Anita Ellis.) My only real complaint with the film was the dream sequence near the film's end. This sequence looks cheap in technique and quite honestly doesn't advance the story as I think was intended. All in all it's a very pleasant couple of hours with music most interested in this title will remember and a true star turn for all three of the headliners.",4.0
"I am not going to sit here and pretend i liked this movie when i first saw it but i am a big fan of the games so i had to give it a shot. I love the games and have defeated them all and i just bought a game cube simply to the R.E. remake so yes i am a true fan of the games themselves which is why i was disappointed with this film. Where was Jill? Where was Claire? Where was Chris? Where was Barry? Where was Wesker? I'm sure you get the point. How can you call a film Resident Evil and then go and not have any of the characters from the game in it? Then when i read that the zombiemaster himself George Romero had walked off the set i just knew it was in trouble. Then an amazing thing happened i saw the film a second time then a third and by then i loved it and it has turned into a fovorite. I have gone on a rampage and purchased a movie poster signed by the cast, various banners, standees and other stuff. I have to say i loved this movie but that was only after i had accepted the fact that Milla was not Jill. Paul Anderson has a good track record as far as i am concerned as i loved Event Horizon which did a wonderful job of blending horror with sci-fi but i still think Resident Evil would have been a better film if Romero had done it. It does lack gore and that certain punch that a zombie film needs and that would have been what Romero brought to the table. Alice doesnt even get a gun until halfway through the movie which is rather disappointing but all in all a very well done quite enjoyable little romp that all fans of the game should own.",4.0
"Frankly, I can't STAND the Resident Evil video games; they're slow and pointless. But for some reason, I truly enjoyed the movie. Maybe it's because it has nothing to do with the games; or maybe it's because I just enjoy seeing zombies get killed. Whatever it is, I recommend this movie to anyone who's in the mood for a solid action flick.",4.0
"OK, for my money this movie rocked.
Of course it's predictable and of course it's cheesy but it's Resident F'in Evil, what did you really expect coming into this movie? It's not The Godfather, or whatever film you may think is ""excellent, 5 stars"", but who cares. Nothing ever is anymore and most likely nothing ever will be again because everyone is sooooo critical.
Sorry, back to the point now. What the film lacked in plot it more than made up for in it's aesthetic appeal. Framing and lighting were well above par. The editing was Tight, Tight, Tight, wrapping up loads of info in short and sweet sequences that over load your brain just enough be excited by what ever otherwise boring, made up, technical fact that you just heard. The sound was completely engrossing which is important for the jumping and the scaring. I normally don't like Marilyn Manson's music, i mean it's really not my thing, but the score was really great.
All in all i thought it was a great Translation/interpretation of a prequel to a video game. and a really great slasher movie. you remember that genre, right?
it is what it is, and it is really cool.",4.0
"Well I have to admit. I wasn't a fan when the movie came out. You know, I went to parties and stayed up late playing..umm Code Veronica and whatnot. Not putting anythought into where the zombies came from or why the hell this chick was runnin' aroung an island with a lighter and a gun. Soo when this movie came out I dragged my best friend to it ( He was the one who held the party and the on I thought I would most enjoy it with . I have to say that I am not one to deal with scary stuff well at all. Even while playing the game I toss the copontroller to the nearest person whenever I open a door, wraped in a blanket. So we sat there watching the preveiws and muching on popcorn and then it started. From start to finish I don't think I let go of the chair's arm or hyperventalting. I screamed at certain parts and but I never closed my eyes once...I was so engrossed in it. So much so that since March or whenever it came out I have been doing anything from checking out the books to getting the re-make on Gamecube. At the time of the movie I had no-clue what anything was..from Umbrella to even who Alice was. But I loved it. Simply loved it. Soo now then that I understand everything more I find myself looking back at some scences of the flick, such as at the end when the man was put into the ""Nemesis"" Project thing. I finally understand. I gave it a four because at the time I didn't know what was happening so I was lost...lost but interested. Well I'm done telling you how I blow off my weekends but playing RE games soo yeaa.. o.o;;",4.0
"I suppose much can be said about this movie's lack of faithfulness to the stage play. A hardened Joey, a more callous Joey, an essentially darker Joey... these things are worth exploring and would be interesting to see. Also, if the cut songs are as good as the ones included, then we have indeed lost much, for the numbers in the film are uniformly excellent. With that said, there is nothing wrong in having the cynic in us take a back burner for once, and watching a pretty decent feel-food movie with a fabulous cast, superb performances, and really excellent music.

  Perhaps the one downer in the film is Kim Novak who, even though she does a respectable job in ""My Funny Valentine"", still manages to irk. Reminiscent of a female Keanu Reeves (she was great in ""Vertigo"" for a reason: She just had to act doe-eyed and aloof. Perfect!) she is pretty annoying here. Oh, and lest we forget, the dream sequence is also burdensome, but it was almost a rite of passage before the ending of a whole lot of musicals, so we'll tolerate it here.

  As for the great aspects of the film, there are many: Rita Hayworth is excellent, with ""Zip"" as her defining moment in the film. Sinatra, of course, is simply fantastic, and elevates the ""Lady is the Tramp"" sequence to new heights of artistry.

  Buy it for Sinatra, fall in love with Rita Hayworth, and tolerate Kim Novak.",4.0
"I've been trying to catch up on my old musicals lately.  It's a genre I didn't quite grow up with and have always been a little ambivalent about.  Never could get a handle of those ""walking down the street and bursting into song"" musicals.  But PAL JOEY is not of that particular mold.  Most of the songs are ""natural,"" in the sense that Joey is a nightclub singer.  Rita Hayworth's number, ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" is the only number that doesn't take place in a club setting, but then again people in love have been known to sing to themselves in their boudoirs, so that's OK too.
Most of the reviews for this film stress the fact that the original Broadway play was considerably darker, and the main character much more of a louse than the cheeky nice guy Sinatra plays here.  Given the era (the late 50s), this is hardly surprising, and it's easy to guess how the edgier theatrical version actually played, even if you don't know the ""book.""
Sinatra is fine as the cheerful heel Joey.  Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak are lovely and sexy as rivals for Joey's affections.  Character actors like Barbara Nichols and Hank Henry milk their smallish roles for all they're worth.  Director George Sidney was a veteran of several classic musicals, including SHOW BOAT, TIL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY and THE HARVEY GIRLS, so he's on familiar turf here, and it shows.
The Rodgers and Hart score is great, but the numbers are not as many as you might hope.  Still there's ""My Funny Valentine,"" the aforementioned ""Bewitched...,"" and, the highlight, Sinatra's definitive take ""The Lady Is a Tramp.""  Well, worth 111 minutes of your time.",4.0
"Frank Sinatra is at his best in this film. He plays his own role, a singer in clubs. He starts out of money and everything and manages to get a position in a club in San Francisco. He has the opportunity to meet a lady-friend of his, an ex-singer who has become a very rich woman and he plays with the idea of a partnership with her. It will break on the simple fact that he is divided between this rich woman from his past and a new girl. The rich woman is jealous of the other and Joey is taken between the two without knowing how to choose or get out of the rivalry without being hurt. He will in the end make the good choice and move to Sacramento, leaving his past behind and going to new adventures. The film is brilliant, the actors and actresses are very good. It sure is not a deep film, but it is a very touching film where women are shown to be the real masters of the world.
