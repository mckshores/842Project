"Should have looked closer prior to buying.  Colors are blah, content is not particularly amusing or interesting to me.  I planned to use it on my kitchen wall, but it just wasn't the bright spot I had hoped it would be.

I tossed it after I got a replacement with pretty photos on it.",2.0
I agree with the other reviews. The website Scarsdale are better than the calendar. Some are ok and there's a funny one every other week.,2.0
Not as funny as the random cards you see.,2.0
I ordered this for something different for my desk this year.  I use these desktop calendars religiously at work and wanted to try something a little humorous this year.  Should've saved my money!  I found most of the pages so far to be either stupid humor that I would never even think of let alone say or so inappropriate for work that I have to cover the captions for the day.  Only a handful have been truly funny!,2.0
"I ordered this because I had seen several of these pictures on Pinterest and Facebook and thought they were hilarious, but the ones in this desktop calendar are just not very funny, and some are inappropriate enough (and again, not even funny) that I can't leave them on my desk at work.",2.0
"I tried to give it time, but I am not in love with this calendar.  I am not easily offended, however, some of the ""sayings"" really cross the line!  You could never have this sitting out in a place of employment.  Also, it's just not as funny as what I am used to seeing on the website.  I'm so disappointed and even now in April, I am going to look for a new calendar.",2.0
"I love the someecards online, but very few of these are even that funny. I wanted this for a desk calender at work but I can't have it out most of the time because most of these aren't work appropriate.",2.0
"As everyone else, I normally enjoy the many posts on social media however I just don't find much laughter coming from the desktop calendar. I really wanted to love it and even ordered it 2 months late thinking it would be worth it the rest of the year but I'm sadly disappointed in the not so funny humor they have listed.",2.0
I appreciate its sarcastic humor but I won't be purchasing another.,2.0
"Like others have said, this one not nearly as funny as others I've seen. And I had this at work and lots were a bit inappropriate for work. Threw it out",2.0
I love the concept of the ecard calendar but it immediately came apart when I opened it and then the back broke off. Sentiments are great but quality poor.,2.0
"its a cynical, Debbie downer  calendar
I regret buying it, I am really concerned  for whoever wrote the one liners. it is Gallows humor without  much humor.
unsophiscated  and mind numbing",2.0
Not funny this year.,2.0
"From the description given I was under the impression I would be getting a better quality product than what I received. The map couldn't have cost more than $15-20 and once I saw the poor quality of the frame I went and had it reframed with a much better wood frame that also had a glass covering for only $35. The current frame does not have any covering for the map, just an FYI.",2.0
"This map is a little hard to look at. It's too busy for me. Too many cities labeled. But then it doesn't label any rivers or lakes.

The country borders are a darker color than the rest of the country, and very thick, plus a thin dashed line. Why not just clear, black borders (or no line at all, just go by the colors)? It doesn't make any sense. For example, France is purple, Germany is green, and the border between them is dark purple. Ugly.

Czech Republic and Poland are the same color, though they border each other. Jordan is white, the same color used for bodies of water...

The map also has an ambiguous blue line running along the coastlines, which looks just like a river. You don't need a line along the coast, as it's pretty obvious where land ends and water starts!

I wouldn't recommend this map. Swiftmaps sells another one called ""48x70 World Classic Wall Map Laminated"", which has a better color and border scheme, but still shares the other problems, including Jordan looking like a body of water.",2.0
"it has conflicting information , in comparision from other resources ????",2.0
Quality of the paper used is disappointing. Doesn't seem like it will last very long as a color reference for a print shop.,2.0
"So, I have a client who is opening a chain of stores, and I am working on the corporate identity. But he wants to get a head start on the paint, so he buys some and lets me know the Pantone color he has chosen so I might use it in the design. Of course, since it was ""Color of the Year 2012, 17-1463 Tangerine Tango"", my older deck doesn't have it. No problem, I guess I'll just buy a new deck so I can have a crystal-clear visual on the color.

Well, SURPRISE! This deck does not have that color in it. It was my understanding that this was the newest version, so why they did not see fit to include last year's Color of the Year is a mystery to me. I guess this is the kind of bungle that happens when a company who has always been focused on printing ink decides to get into the kind of interior decor that gets bought at Home Depot. Really dropped the ball there, Pantone.",2.0
"colors are no longer in order numerically.
pages are very thin, this book is not going to last a busy contractor who is constantly looking for colors.
pages tear easily.",2.0
"Was disappointed with the size of the screen, especially for retires, and to show people with which you are attempting to communicate.",2.0
I was hoping that I could just speak a phrase or question into the device and it would translate and repeat it in the language I wanted to target instead of having to go through different sections and not always having the answer !,2.0
Does not translate from one language to another like the ones online. IS basically a dictionary and have some template sentences.,2.0
"I am a student of Italian and therefor wanted a complete, hand-held, easily carried dictionary for classroom use. This device fails in the first category. I have traded it for one that is Italian/English only versus this one that tries to be the Swiss Army knife of translators with its 17 languages and myriad features.",2.0
I ordered NIV but was given KJV edition.,2.0
"I'm in grad school and prefer the traditional method of note taking to typing everything out on a laptop or tablet.  I go through a number of composition books and was trying to be a little more ""green"", so I checked out these de-composition books.  Love the idea, but $6-7 per book?!  That's ridiculous.  If they were $2 a book (still twice the price of a normal composition book at Target) I would be happy to spend the extra money, but these are wildly impractical.  Kinda bummed that I will have to continue to use the other style versus these apparent novelty books.  Does anyone know where these can be purchased for a lower price?",2.0
I like the style of this book but the binding came apart in the first week of use.  I've taped the binding down myself so I can continue to use.,2.0
"I love the design and it was exactly what I was looking for, however when the notebook arrived the binding was peeling off. I saw a review on the product that said this was the case, but liked the design so much that I figured I would try it. I ended up having to glue the binding back on, which was frustrating. I am giving it as a gift, so hopefully the binding doesn't peel off again. This would be a great product, if the company used a glue that worked!",2.0
"The design is great, but the cover is not very durable.",2.0
"The bindings on both loose, though this may be a shipping error.  The front and back covers are only half as stiff as most composition books.  The black cloth that is supposed to cover the binding and wrap around the covers was only glued to the binding.  I will have to finish gluing it together myself.  I will not purchase anything made by Michael Roger, Inc. again.",2.0
"The book is great, if it wasn't falling apart as I open the packaging.. disappointed but hopefully I will be able to fix it, wish me luck.",2.0
"The binding immediately started falling apart - no big deal, I taped it back together with packing tape.  The bigger issue for me is that I like writing with Uniball Vision pens, and they bleed through this paper so badly it makes marks on the next page.  Too bad - if these notebooks were more durable I'd be really into them.",2.0
"Looks great, cheap construction compared to other comp books and not worth the price.  Fell apart quickly.",2.0
Love the journal and the idea... but it is falling apart. Not worth the price,2.0
"Bookmark stuck inside of plastic covering. Haven't gotten it out yet, but bookmark is very cute. Hope that I get it out without damaging the bookmark.",2.0
Has a dent and other imperfections.,2.0
Ruler measurements on the other side of it???? Bookmark comes somewhat scratched up. Only reason I am not giving a 1 star is because it was only 2 bucks. So I guess it's good for what you pay for but overall unhappy.,2.0
Arrived with a crease and the sleeve was kind of dirty. Wouldn't want to give it as a gift.,2.0
"Bad quality, scratched and dented",2.0
I love these book marks I usually buy them at barns and noble but they seem to be B-stock or something because they are peeling and the coloring is coming off. So I would not buy them online again.,2.0
"Love the bookmark itself but the one I received had obvious signs of having been out of its original packaging. It was taped to the packaging and you can see scratches on the surface of the bookmark, some letters look scratched off or wore out as if it was bought and then returned. I'm not happy about it.",2.0
"I love this bookmark, but literally the first time I used it the string came off and the beads fell off.",2.0
"I liked the iridescent notebook version of this, and I thought it would be the same.  It is matte finish, and not all that dramatic.",2.0
Beautiful but arrived bent:/,2.0
A cute bookmark but it fell apart since I purchased it a month ago. Beads and tassels fell off. I probably should have used a scrap of paper and saved three dollars.,2.0
"Nice bookmark, but the gold foil lettering stuck to the plastic covering.  Not acceptable for me to give as a gift as I was planning to do.",2.0
This was bent when I got it,2.0
Probably I didn't read the info but it's a thin paper which I wasn't expecting so that was a turn off but I guess you pay for what you bought,2.0
my bookmark took 2 months to get here!! and the beads ended up falling off,2.0
"not very good, so large",2.0
Very basic quality.  The tassel is the nicest part.  It's worth a $1 or $2...,2.0
"Over-priced and cheaply made. The strings unravelled on the second day, and the package was far too big for the bookmark.",2.0
The bookmark was pretty but fell apart almost immediately; therefor the bookmark was obviously not worth it. I ended up using other bookmarks.,2.0
"I got this bookmark in the mail and it came in with dents, scratches, and the corner was bent and was peeling. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.",2.0
Could have printed it out myself. Not laminated either.,2.0
Cool art and quote. That is all.,2.0
String was missing when it arrived.,2.0
"I just got my package through the mail (awesome delivery, BTW.) But the product wasn't as sturdy as I thought it was. I was able to pick the lock with my hands! (After locking it of course.) I was very disspointed. And the spine looks like it can be easily ripped out. If you are a heavy journalist, DO NOT GET THIS CUTE LITTLE DIARY!
-Sophia",2.0
"not very good, so large",2.0
Some of the gold letters were already stuck to plastic when I received the item.  It's not worth the price.,2.0
Did not have full poem on it... Guess I needed to pay closer attention to that but assumed...!,2.0
"Its a paper, not coated with protection from wear and tear",2.0
The entire poem is not posted on it. I was very disappointed.,2.0
"I guess I didn't look close enough at this bookmark, as I was sure it had the poem, Footprints in the Sand written on it. I was mistaken, however, I had purchased more than one, and I sent one of them to my niece along with the book Footprints. I'm sure at some point, I will find other family members or friends to send one to.",2.0
Too small.  Looks cheap.,2.0
"Not as small as I expected it to be.  And, the pages are somewhat hard to separate.  But, I like it and needed a new address book.",2.0
too small to hardly write in,2.0
it was too small for me,2.0
"Didn't check the dimensions of the book before purchasing and found that it was much smaller
than I would have liked. Will have to make do.",2.0
The text at the bottom was partially scratched off :/,2.0
Not very pretty shade seeing this in person. Reminds me of pigskin.,2.0
A lot smaller than I thought it'd be,2.0
wanted a address book that also had a place to keep track of birthdays and anniversaries,2.0
"While I do really like this address book, I always struggle to write small enough on each line. I'm a neat writer but if you even remotely write large, you won't be able to fit any info in the spaces. The actual size of the book is the perfect size for me but they need to make the lines farther apart. While I do use this book, I wouldn't purchase it again.",2.0
not good quality,2.0
I was hoping I could finally stop looking for a small address book that had enough room to be able to write normally.  I thought I did but when I started to fill out there wasn't enough space to print.  I couldn't even read what I tried to print. It's a darling book but just now practical for me.  Can't return as I tried to write in it.,2.0
"I know its called the little pink book , but I thought I would be able to write on the lines. WAY SMALL.",2.0
"I was so excited when I ordered this address book only to get disappointed upon arrival. Its cute but TINY, it feels like the addresses are cramped in the little tine pages.",2.0
"I like the front of the book and love the color.  However, the paper used for the addresses is very cheap and the amount of space they give you to write the person's name and address is laughable.  If I had known this I would not have bought it.  I do not think this is worth $8.  I feel it would have been a good value at $6.  If you write in microscopic letters then you won't mind this but if you write with normal size letters or you tend to write in large letters, this is not for you.  I did write some addresses in it and if I wrote really small, it was fine.  Still don't like the cheap paper.",2.0
"I ordered this for my 7 year old daughter.  We moved, and I wanted her to have an address book for all her old friends.  The cover and tabs are just what I wanted.  Something simple and easy for her to use.  Unfortunately, the spaces are super tiny and difficult for even adults to enter their information.  While I looked at the inside pages, I failed to realize that though the book was a good size, there are too many entries crammed onto a page.  We are keeping it for now, but I will be on the lookout for another address book that will work for my daughter.",2.0
"Although many store information in their phones, it is always nice to have a backup in case the phone is damaged or lost.  The word little is not a lie.  The print is too little and there isn't enough space to write.",2.0
"It arrived in good condition.  I liked the spiral binding and the elastic band to mark the pages.  But when I opened it to begin writing, I found that the print was too small and the area for writing not sufficient.  I also prefer a page or two for each letter of the alphabet instead of combining them, i.e. AB - CD - EF,  etc. It would be a good book for travel or to carry in ones purse, as it was small.",2.0
"This address book is extremely small. It makes writing and reading the addresses very hard. It has a good amount of pages, however I wish I would have purchased something bigger and more legible.",2.0
Very small. Pocket size,2.0
Well this was damaged had a huge fold in it. A mystery how it happened because it was only shipped with 4 other book marks in a cardboard box folder. Have no idea how that could have happened inside the box unless damaged before being placed in the box. Any way not worth sending back so I cut the bottom 1/2 off where the fold was so I have a gold sun bookmark with a tassle on it that has 1/2 a saying on it. Hey it works.,2.0
A little too small.  The pages are hard to turn because they are too snug to the rings.,2.0
Too small. Looks cheap.,2.0
"Two stars because the design is very nice and it's a sturdyish material. That being said, the tassel and beads all fell off on me in one shot! Within a month!!! I carry a book in my very organized purse it's not like it gets knocked around a ton but I have a book and for the past month this bookmark on me almost all of the time. Today walking home with the book in my hand the tassel and the beads all fell off
:-( sad and disappointed even if it was inexpensive",2.0
too small to be of any great use,2.0
"Address book is perfectly fine for addresses.  I am disappointed because I was under the impression that it had a dedicated spit for birthdays. There is an extra line under the address section for each entry, but not a lot of room to write anything extra.",2.0
Not much of anything to praise.yeT,2.0
Too small,2.0
Not up to original equipment quality.,2.0
I don't know but there is something about the way that these roller balls write that is just not fluid or clean. The tip is rough when writing and doesn't write effortlessly. I also don't like the fit and how it sticks out a little further than it should. I would not buy another one.,2.0
"The first refill lasted a month, and I don't write that much.  Very disappointing.",2.0
"When I opened the box, the pen bag was open.  It looked as if there were one pen in it, but there is only a ""shell"".  There were no pens in the package.  I did not receive my order.",2.0
I love the size and amount of pages however all of the middle pages are stuck together & I can't get them unstuck without ripping them.  So very disappointed in the quality of this,2.0
the alphabet tabs were 2 letters to each tab.  I did not expect that.  I expected 1 letter for each tab.,2.0
Too bulky and hard cover,2.0
"Way to small for my purposes.  Needed one much bigger.  To get all you want on the small pages, you need to hire some fairytale little person that writes real, real small!",2.0
Printing errors in the book,2.0
"Way too small. I shoulde have looked at measurements.  I should have known! After all, it does state ""Little Black Book."" Great as a gift but too small for me!",2.0
Pages stick together and rip. Its cheap and small. Next time will go with something larger and better quality.,2.0
It's size is small and  the space is not quite enough in writing a contact details,2.0
Didnt think it would be as tiny as it is,2.0
"This book is very small.  The contact pages are big enough to write in unless they have a long address.  The middle pages along the ring were all stuck together so when I would try to turn my page, the paper tore along the ring that holds them in, so the pages are now half torn.  I did not realize it was like that until I reached the middle of the book to add my Contacts.  Also, on the tabs that display the letters for the contact finder, part of the letters are missing in the bottom letter.",2.0
The book is larger than I had thought it would be. The silver phone and writing had smeared on the front.,2.0
"I actually returned this item the minute I got it.  Partly my fault for not looking at the dimensions....I can see perfectly fine, but the print & everything about this address book is way too small.  This wasn't even going to be for myself & I still would not recommend it.",2.0
"Although small enough to fit in my purse, the lines for information are too narrow.  Fewer entries/items a page to allow more space for writing would have made this item perfect.  I am using it anyway but straddling many lines.",2.0
"It is really too small, I bought this for my husband and he did not like it. It is still not being used",2.0
"I bought this and while I find it well organized, it's just too small to be helpful.  I wish there were fewer entries per page, they combine far too many letters in sections, and the space for each entry is too slim.  Keep looking.",2.0
I am a huge fan of josephine wall's art but this bookmark did not wow me at all. Cheap and came bent. Very disappointed.,2.0
"The bookmark arrived damaged (bent/crinkled with a small tear near the top).  It also had short strings with no beads and no tassel on the end.  Very disappointing as it was purchased as a gift and we don't have time to send it back for a replacement.  The picture is so cute, but what we received was disappointing.",2.0
"These are okay for what they are, but they are a lot smaller than I had imagined. Still, not too bad for an add-on item though.",2.0
I loved the calendar last year....but this year there are so many things printed in the squares that I don't hv room for my things....,2.0
My son didn't find this very engaging. We were hoping for more hands on experiments built into the lessons. We gave up on it before getting half-way through the book. We will be trying another science curriculum.,2.0
I returned the first one because the corners were damaged. They sent me a new one and that one had damage on the corners as well. So now I have to give my mom a gift with a blemish on the corner because it's so close to Christmas. I was shocked because the reviews for this product seemed mainly positive. I wouldn't recommend this.,2.0
I wish I could have seen the table of contents before I purchased it. This book only had a few science topics that actually correlate to my curriculum.,2.0
Very THIN lamenent. Colors are good. Size is ok.,2.0
"The map is beautiful, lots of detail, however I was disappointed to see that it arrived with chewed up edges. It arrived in a plastic poster tube within a box (well protected). Once I opened the box I could see through the tube that it was damaged. This is a gift and simply not enough time to order a new one for Xmas.",2.0
"Well, the map is very nice, I probably should have splurged on a laminated one.  It does come tubed, but I had to order a replacement and they both came with damages or bends.  I think a paper tube would really save the day on this product.  The Square tube it comes in is not packed with much else and the box is fragile.",2.0
A bit TOO busy for us. Makes it a LOT harder to find the National Parks.  That's the only reason why we bought it.  We need to find a better map.,2.0
Came wrinkled,2.0
"Both the tube that the map was packed in and the map itself looked used.  Not too bad, but one edge of the map was wrinkled and had tiny rips in it.  The tube looked like it had been used a few times.  Kind of strange???",2.0
"Very flimsy, just a piece of paper. Recommend to invest in a better-quality real map.",2.0
Ordered together with the world map. Laminate quality is so inferior that it can't even hold the map with pins on the wall. Paper thin and tears easily. Stay away if you need laminate. Map itself is fine.,2.0
"The map and quality are great - exactly what I wanted. The problem I have is with shipping/handling. Whoever originally stored this map, folded it. Although it's laminated, it came to me with significant creases that couldn't be worked out (I've literally tried everything to smooth them to no avail). I'm disappointed that I paid this much for a ruined product.",2.0
"Disappointed in this.  Not for someone who is planning a trip by highway.  Typeface(s) used were mice type, colors are too dark.  I liked the overall size and the laminate.  Might be better for a U.S. geography student.  I'll find one to give this to.",2.0
Good map except I expected it to have an antique look similar to the photo. The colors are much brighter than it looks. I was not able to use it in the way I wanted to.,2.0
"The colors are darker than they appear online. The map is actually quite ugly, but it wasn't worth returning.",2.0
The lamination has bubbles.  Will be returning for a refund.,2.0
The map came ripped.,2.0
"Nice map, but it was rolled too tight in a plastic sleeve, and put in a square box that got pushed into a diamond shape. It has ripples and creases in the laminate. Why isn't this in a triangular box or round tube? I'm not going to risk it again unless the package design changes.",2.0
Map was very nice and detailed. Exactly what you would expect from national geographic. But the map appeared to have gotten wet at some point during the shipping process. Also the protective tube the map was shipped in was crushed making the map useless to display. My recommendation would be to buy the map directly from national geographic NOT through amazon.,2.0
"This map has very little detail.  I have found it fairly useless.  I like to find where cities, rivers, mountains etc. are located in the stories I read. Nothing I have ever looked for on this map is there.",2.0
The map came crushed in it's cardboard tube.  it's much smaller than I imagined.  Wasn't worth the price.,2.0
"Map itself is wonderful!  But when I CAREFULLY took it out of the tube it was FULL of dings from improper packaging.
They a a huge distraction.",2.0
"It came with some wrinkles and tiny tears around the edges. It was in a tube, so I'm not sure why that happened.",2.0
The map is to small to read the cities or see any road net work.  Would like to have a much larger map of the eastern US,2.0
"I wanted a big map of Alaska. This map takes up a lot of space on the wall but the details are not any larger than I have in my road atlas, maybe even smaller.  So, while it may be a nice map it is not what we were looking for.",2.0
"Sure, the size is listed, but it is smaller than I was thinking and really doesn't meet my needs at all.",2.0
"The map is beautiful (potentially)  however it came with creases that pretty much ruins it. It looks as if it was crushed with something after being rolled. Now have to play the return game.

***update*** The second map arrived promptly but I got stuck on the return shipping for $17.  The second map had what I will call minor creases compared to the first one they sent, but i'm ultimately pleased with the product ...looks great on the wall.

Packager needs to look at the machine used to laminate and roll, It may need adjustment...",2.0
"The map itself is amazing and the quality I'd expect from National Geographic. Unfortunately, the map was packaged without a strong cardboard tube so was flattened with creases in the map every 4 inches or so. The map has been hung for over 1 month and it still has creases. It baffles as to why this can't be packaged like nearly all posters/maps are packaged today.",2.0
"map is great, but arrived bent/creased. purchased the laminated to hang on a wall. looks terrible with all of the lines.",2.0
"This map of the Caribbean is one of the best, and normally perfect for wall mounting.  But, instead of shipping in a solid shipping cylinder, it was shipped in a flimsy and oversized rectangular box, which, with no body and virtually empty, arrived crushed.  The rolled-up map inside was of course, flattened, with repeated creases across it's width, and no chance of it being presentable enough to mount on a wall.  Have to go through the hassle of returning, ordering a new one, etc.  And, I'm hoping that the replacement is shipped in the proper type of container -- a cylindrical cartridge of the type typically used to ship anything round and oversized (large calendars, maps, etc.).",2.0
This map is very thin and flimsy.  Not at all what I expected for the price.  Worth maybe 5.00.,2.0
The tube did not protect the map. Paid extra for tube and it didn't work.  The map content itself is great.,2.0
Not what I thought it would be.  Should've read the description better.,2.0
"I expected this book to be more about the creative process of art journaling. While the author has some interesting examples of her own art journals, accompanied by some ""how to' s"", I think I could have done all of what she explained on my own. For those totally new to creating art who need some more concrete directions on how to make things, this would be appropriate. Didn't work for me, though!",2.0
I was rather shocked to see the crude art work in this book. It is hard to believe that this sells. I do not consider this art and gave the book away. It is a craft book.,2.0
"So, from reading the reviews I thought this was going to be a great book. It turned out it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I thought it would be more about creative journalling and less about modern art. I expected more typography and less paint and stencils. The one plus side to this book is it has a great explanation of the grid and how it works and how to balance pages with color and composition.",2.0
Great design but has plastic parts that break very quickly even if you are really careful. It can be taped but who wants that? It's too bad they didn't go the extra mile to make it last.,2.0
Whenever I move it the wheels fall off :(  Easy to assemble and does it's job as long as you don't try to move it,2.0
Not what I was expecting.  THey were seriously just insults - not particularly witty or the type of thing you would really say.,2.0
"I ordered this from Amazon after flipping through it in a store.  The pages I read in the store must have contained the only witty, clever retorts in the book.  For the most part these are dumb, truly insulting or both.  I bought this as a gift but ended up not giving it to the intended giftee.",2.0
"I tried very hard to use this item and love it. Great idea in concept but would be better if we could personalize it to order. A lot of the staples on the pad are for items I don't buy, and it is missing some items I always buy. I decided I might as well go back to hand writing grocery lists for all the good this one does me.",2.0
"This is really a pretty useful weekly-tracker pad, and a bonus is that it comes with 60 sheets rather than the typical 52 sheets you get with a ""weekly"" purchase list. Unfortunately this list, despite being the correct size for a mousepad, doesn't actually work as one. I imagine if you had an old-school roller-ball mouse that it would work fine, but this DOES NOT WORK with laser mice.",2.0
"The materials are good. They're smaller than It looks on screen,and letters are way too small to read. I thought I could put it on desplay and have fun reading it. Its partly my fault that I did not read the description of measurements.",2.0
"Great idea, but my mouse will not move on it.",2.0
"Pad is too big. Should be 5""x7"" or smaller to be useful.",2.0
It was bigger than expected. Takes up a lot of space on the fridge.,2.0
Much smaller than expected,2.0
"Mine were not sticky notes, just leaflets.",2.0
"Super small ! My fault never read size, I guess I have too many mental notes",2.0
Cute but ordered worlds greatest dad and received ornament that said worlds greatest mom. Embarrassing when my husband opened it as a gift from our son. :(,2.0
Nice product but wayyyyyyyy over priced. Small container of specialty post it notes for more than $10?,2.0
The item description states that this a pack of 3. It is not!!!,2.0
"received 1 pad instead of the advertised 4-pack. Love these pads, but frustrated with the false advertising.",2.0
"I bought the Deal With It pad because it has boxes to write the time and date of the message, check boxes for when you need it done by and lines to write your message. All great ideas and conveniently printed for you. The problem is its all way too small.

 The boxes for time and date are so small that even if you write only two numbers it won't fit in its respective box unless you write it EXTREMELY small and, the printing that identifies each box (day, month, year, etc.) is so small you need a magnifier to see which is which.

 The check boxes to indicate when you need it done by are so small you might not see which one is checked. The printing of the words for those boxes (immediately, by end of day, within a week, etc.) are big enough to see without a magnifier.

 The lines to write the message on are only about an eighth of an inch wide, forcing you to write out your message with very small letters and, the lines are deliberately printed ragged and uneven to make it look like someone drew them on freehand. That raggedness makes the lines even narrower in some parts. Its very difficult for me to write as small as I need to on these notes and some people might have a difficult time reading a message written with letters that small.

 All these elements could have been made at least a little bigger if they hadnt wasted so much space at the top of the note with the Deal With It line.

 The one positive thing I can say about this pad is the sticky part on back seems to be good. I stuck one on a smooth surfaced wood door and it stayed stuck for a full day before someone took it off.
 I give it two stars because the idea of all these elements on one note is good, they just didn't think through the layout and give enough space for things to be visible. I would not recommend these to anyone.",2.0

These were very small and not many papers come in each stack. They're nice just not for what I paid for them...,2.0

"The sticky notes are both funny, and useful since sometimes we have a hard time confronting each other in my family. So if we are too angry to speak up we would fill one of these sticky notes out and talk later when everyone is calm. Biggest issue, they are way too small,  it's difficult to write everything you need to on them and can be just as hard to read because everything is so small.

$14 for a book barely larger than a business card? Was not expecting that at all... somewhat of a rip-off in my opinion.,2.0
The book is ridiculously small for 14 bucks. Not even the size of a 3x5 card. The picture makes it look larger or the woman holding the pink book has smaller hands than Donald Trump. Doesnt seem like much of a value.,2.0
This book is tiny! I was shocked. The content was pretty nice but the size was rediculous.,2.0
The size wad surprising small and I could have made a home-madr one with better phrases to fill in.,2.0

It's the size of my palm and my hand is small....Very disappointing! I can't give my mom this for Christmas. It's pitiful,2.0
"Seems like the copied over questions from a girlfriend/boyfriend book.  Some of the questions they had you answer were just weird and uncomfortable for something you would give your Mom.

Really small book for the amount paid. Delivery was super long and arrived way after mothers day.,2.0
"I felt a lot of the questions in the book were repetitive, either the book should be shorter or have more interesting questions.",2.0
Really tiny and very simple. Got this as a gift to my mom for Mother's Day next month. I love sentimental keepsakes to give as gifts but this is more of what a child would give - it's a little young. I've already filled it out but can't say I'm entirely pleased with this purchasing decision...,2.0
Very small,2.0
OK - but really small,2.0
I thought this was going to be two separate strips but it is one pad with both lists on it. Who the heck wants two different type of lists on the same page,2.0
Three months later & it's  an opened still in its wrapping on my kitchen counter. It was a cute idea but it's just not very realistic and useful for me.,2.0
Loved them. They were fun to use.,2.0
"Great size and color, but it does not erase well.",2.0
The crayons really don't even write on the surface of the cards.  Poorly done.  This is more like the writing surface for markers.,2.0
"I got this for English as a Second Language practice, but was quickly disappointed to find that the cards are insufficient in supporting grammar. For example, when building present tense sentences that are in 3rd person, there is no appropriate verb ""she says/speaks/eats."" The cards, therefore, only reinforce sentence building like ""She eat food."" More surprisingly, the cards don't have enough duplicates for playing with two children. There is only 1--I repeat ONE--capital ""I"" card, but there are 2 exclamation marks, as if you need more of those than simple personal pronouns? The kids I play this with really want to build story sentences, but this box, even with 250 words, misses the mark occasionally. And I am very hesitant about it reinforcing all the grammar I spent hours teaching.",2.0
This was much more confusing for my students than I though \t it would be.  I was hoping it would help teach them sentence structure but instead you must really be able to already make sentences no problem to be able to use this correctly without an adult telling the child each and every piece.  Maybe once my students get the hang of sentences then they will find this interesting.  For now they just keep adding pieces to one another creating a mess.,2.0
It  comes with a very limited number of words. It is very basic- I guess it would be good for beginners who are still learning sight words.,2.0
"Don't buy these as a teacher, not helpful and the pictures give it away.",2.0
"Good idea, not very helpful for a first grader. The age on this game is K-2. However, there is really no way of bringing the sentences beyond Kindergarten level. My son who is in first grade was easily bored after one time play. I wouldn't recommend this for any parent trying to help their child at a 1st or 2nd grade level. The words are also limited. There are no ""N"" words for example. There should really be an equal amount of nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives and so on. That's not the case here unfortunately.",2.0
Kids didn't have much interest in this!,2.0
"I'm a speech-language pathologist and was hoping to use this with my students for word order, sentence expansion, etc. They enjoy it but there aren't word endings so many of the sentences they try to build aren't grammatically correct!",2.0
"It was on delay and had not shipped out.  I found out my school had several I could use but they would not cancel the order.  HMMMM!  It came in a huge oversize box and was all curled up.  It was only 3 bucks so not out much, but it is aggravating that I couldn't cancel the order WWWWWAAAAYYYYY before it shipped.",2.0
"The poster itself is made of decent quality paper with a semi-gloss (although not laminated) finish.  But what the product description omits is that the poster isn't tubed, rolled, or otherwise wrapped.  This means that the poster heads to your door unprotected, as is, folded over in a box.  Since product review guidelines generally prohibit commenting on shipping issues, I won't mention the cruddy condition in which my poster arrived.  With a bit of ""TLC,"" this could be a favorable find.  For now, however, this product delivers two stars.",2.0
"The number ""9"" on this poster is not using an actual ""9"", it is using the letter ""q"".  I saw this immediately when I looked at the poster and I am surprised that more people have not noticed this.  For something that has the sole purpose of being a learning tool for children they should have used the correct character.",2.0
I really thought this was going to be laminated..its not.  My 3 year old will ruin it!  I will have to buy another on now.,2.0
"I wish I would have read the reviews. It is open at the top of each pocket, so the borders don't stay in place too well.",2.0
It doesn't look what the image shows. It is much smaller than the image shows. I bought just normal clear pocket dice which is much nice than this one. They are cheaper too.,2.0
"Was very disappointed to see it was just a  typical pocket chart.  I was hoping for sleeves that were closed on 3 sides where the border slid into the sleeve, or something that could be easily snapped closed or sealed.  Not sure how things can stay in place when the sleeves gape open.  I would recommend a velcro strap or snaps at points along the edge of the plastic.  Otherwise, not really useful.",2.0
This is poorly made. The plastic protector gets stuck to another when I go to open up and my borders fall out every time!,2.0
Very flimsy pockets. Not the quality I imagined,2.0
This had a weird shape to it. I don't like that it isn't hang-able or stand-able like the picture suggests.,2.0
Poorly constructed. corners not sewn clean causing 2 of these to repeatedly roll to the same number or picture. Bought these to use in a preschool. Cannot recommend.,2.0
For the price they were very poorly made. I don't know how long they will last. If I paid less I wouldn't be upset but this kind of feels like a rip-off. We will still use them and like the concept.,2.0
"The CD-5638 Bag does not have pockets per Amazon decription-""Store or transport three packs of borders in each of five clear plastic 37"" x 4"" pockets - 15 total!"".  Also, it does not measure ""Overall 38"" x 25"".  It is actually 30"" x 24"".  I think this is the same bag as the ""Deluxe Bulletin Board Storage Pocket Chart"" which is significantly cheaper.",2.0
Won't fit any of my standard sized chairs:( gave them away and would not fit any of my two friends chairs:-/,2.0
"I recently purchased five of these for additional students that have joined my class.  Within the first two weeks, two of them ripped down the side of the large pocket.  I realize that some students will overload that particular pocket but these were not overloaded.  The older ones hold up much better - it seems that the new ones are just not made as well.  The other three are still together but be prepared to repair these.  On a positive note - they look good and do help keep the classroom a lot neater.",2.0
The cards to write the time and class are not laminated,2.0
A little smaller than what I thought but well made.,2.0
"The product was shipped very fast, however, when I received it, it was bent and damed very badly. I contacted the company and they are sending another out and were very cooperative. I'm just worried the next one will be damaged. They should ship it with cardboard or protect it some way. It's just shipped in a plastic bag.",2.0
"They were not self stick. The backing would not tear off. Great colors, really brightens the room",2.0
I really like everything about it except the A is already coming off the wall....I run a daycare and tought this would be a great way to introduce the letters...one a week well by the time I got to c...A was curling up on the corner...very disappointing...other than that they are beautiful,2.0
"The books marks that I received did not come with the decorative beads. I wanted to give these as gifts for Easter.  They are still nice bookmarks, but I didn't get what I paid for and it is not worth the bother to send them back.  I will not order them again.",2.0
Paper quality as not very good.  Calendar fell apart!,2.0
"I bought 8 of these for the women in our family and sent them all back. The art work was beautiful on each month, however, the quality of the paper used for this calendar was very cheap, which for me, ruined the whole thing. I did not want to give our daughter and daughters-in-law this quality of gift. By the time I got these sent back I didn't have time to re-order something else, so I shopped
close to home and found the same type of calendar in a very high quality and got those instead. Amazon was so nice in handling this transaction and refund. Thanks Amazon for your outstanding service. I'll be back.",2.0
The numbers of the day in the month are way too small to see from any distance. I need them a lot larger to see at all.,2.0
"I have purchased the Mom's Plan-It Calendar for several years in a row and have always been very pleased with it.  However, I am very disappointed with the new edition for 2013 as the pages are much more glossy and very difficult to write on.  It is impossible to use pencil on it, which is always a nice option since times and appointments change.  And ballpoint pen is not much better either.  You have to go over it a couple of times with your pen to get all the letters in your words to even show up.  I hope the manufacturer will go back to the old type of paper or I will not be purchasing in the future.  If you are in a rush and your schedule needs to be erased or changed frequently, I don't recommend this calendar.",2.0
"This wasn't what I was looking for...I'm sure it's a great calendar, but I needed the one with the slots to write family members' names. I returned this.",2.0
Calendar is cute and designed well - in terms of layout.  Magnet will not stick to calendar rendering it on the floor.  Makes it useless.  Do not recommend.,2.0
very disappointing to find out that the messages are in their big majority from the bible.,2.0
"The layout of Jesus Calling 365 Day Perpetual Calendar is not as good as the daily devotional book. I feel the font size should fill the page, so it is inviting to read each day! The writing is soo small and hard to read that it often goes unnoticed. Sad for me, because if it looked like the book pages, it would have been a ""home run"".",2.0
I love every other version of Jesus Calling. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that the verses at the bottom are missing the text and you have to look it up so that makes the focus of the devotional on the author's message instead of God's word.,2.0
"Could have been excellent but it has a major downside.  I think most educators can agree that one point of having a workbook is for convenience.  This workbook has quality, simple exercises that effectively teach.  I bought two of these books for my homeschooled students so
I wouldnt have to make photocopies.  As it turns out I would have to photocopy most of the book in order to use it as instructed.  A great majority of the pages require the student to cut and paste, rendering other pages useless.  It makes no sense.  It is as if this books was only designed to be reproduced for the classroom setting or something.  Other times it asks the students questions and expects the student to find the answer by flipping to the next page.  This gets very confusing during map grid work.  If all these books are like this I would not buy again.  It is a
shame though because the information is solid.",2.0
"I have wanted this for quit sometime now. While it is all together and I can still use it, it wasn't worth what I paid for it. The cover is detached and it looks like there has been a little water damage to it.",2.0
I received the book today and the cover was not glued on properly or at all really.  I had to fix it myself and it is a gift.  For the price I paid it should have been in perfect shape.  Not happy.,2.0
"Sold for $2 over suggested retail price, and had some minor damage.",2.0
"I love journals. I'm a journal fanatic. And this one looks so gorgeous in the picture! But I was very disappointed when I received it. My first thought upon opening the package was, ""Oh, damn! They sent me a faded one. And it's dirty, too!"" That's how different the actual color is from the product picture. I've been buying only the Deconstructed journals because they lay flat and are easy to write in, but I'm picky about how they look, too. So if you're buying this one because it's so bright and beautiful in the product picture...reconsider. In reality, the colors are dull and flat and those cool earthy tones you can see in the background are very prominent and make the journal look like it's been handled by someone with very dirty hands. I have several of the Deconstructed Journals, but I've now bought two from Amazon that are not true to the product picture, so I guess I'll be buying in store from Barnes & Noble from now on so that I can get what I see. It's still a great journal, but...I'm very disappointed that the product picture is so deceiving.",2.0
I loved the journal but the cover fell off within the first week of using it. I know it's a deconstructed journal and the binding wasn't great but it still should not have fallen apart in only a week of using it.,2.0
"The paper is very thin, and easy to tear.  There are all kinds of odd parts that have no clear use.  There was not enough border to do the same stretch of hall I do every year and have strips left over.  I bought it for the owls, but I would not buy it again.",2.0

"Product description says: ""Help students learn about the days of the week and months of the year with this engaging pocket chart. It includes 100 cards including days of the week, months of the year, calendar cover-ups, and holidays!""

Guess what? I did NOT get what was described. My pocket chart looks completely different than what is pictured--there are no pockets at the bottom, it is just two velcro strips as if I'm supposed to attach something there? Annoying because now I have nowhere to store the extra pieces. Speaking of extra pieces, my order did NOT come with ""calendar cover-ups and holidays!"" In fact, my months and numbers are NOT colorful and cute as pictured, rather they are PLAIN WHITE PAPER AND PLAIN BLACK TEXT. I could have made something better myself in Powerpoint!!!! Do I have a pocket chart with useable months and dates? Yes. Which is why I gave two stars. But I mean COME ON I am a teacher and I don't have time for returns!",2.0
Box is too small making it difficult for my son to pull the cards on his own.,2.0
Not what I imagined - parts too easy for 8 & over - illustrations of presidents not very good - will see if it works out,2.0
"The product wasn't bad, and it shipped quickly.  The problem is, it is missing 2 months from the labels, specifically September and October (which is right now!).  Kind of a vital part of a classroom calendar.",2.0
All I got was the pocket chart. I never got any numbers or monthly headers.,2.0
I was very disappointed to find that the July/August calendar cards were missing from my order.  Everything else was there and looked great but why would you want an incomplete set?  I don't understand how something like this could be overlooked when packaging this product.  It was very frustrating for us as we went to put it together.,2.0
They are flimsy but they were easy to hang and tape throughout the house and tablecloths.,2.0
"Ya gotta love Si, but I was kinda disappointed in this calendar. It's very cheaply made. Don't waste your money.",2.0
It wasn't exactly what l expected but decent and will work.,2.0
"I purchased this massager because I liked that it was plug in and that you had a sliding wheel to change speeds. Many massagers come with a button you press to navigate between a few speeds and several pulse patterns. The pulse patterns don't really interest me. I just need speed.
This becomes very heavy in the hand. The had is very large and even though it is not that strong, the top sort of *bounce* around the targeted area.
It does not deliver and I find myself wanting more.
It is loud, though I have had louder massagers. Because of it's size it is definitely not discreet, and you can hear it from other rooms.
It gets warm after 20 minutes or so. It does not come with a carrying bag, which would be nice for storage.
DO NOT BUY
I was hoping because of the size it would pack all the *punch* I needed, Unfortunately that was not the case.
One month after purchasing and it is already breaking down. The speed, though slow in the begnning, is even slower now.",2.0
"Review Update (10 months using case)
I loved this case at first, and I still think the design is amazing, but I don't think it's worth the money. The design is peeling pretty badly around the edges, which started within the first month, and one of the clips on the bottom has somehow broken off. I'm pretty disappointed since this case didn't even last 1 full year..The clip may not seem like that big of a deal, but without it the case is constantly slipping off that side of my laptop. This is the first laptop case I've ever spent more than $15 on, and it didn't last nearly as long as any of my past cases. Disappointed.",2.0
"Totally cool art,  with a totally ridiculous calandar that isn't even a serious attempt at a real calendar. If you want a normal calendar, like one that you can read or make a note on....forget this. A useless calendar might as well be no calendar.",2.0

Two of the glasses were unfortunately broken on delivery. Must now try to figure how I could get them replaced.,2.0
My roommate had one that was brand new in which I left water at a bowl in the pot for maybe 10 minutes and the water alone cooked away the protective layer inside the pot and stained it white. Since the pot was not mine I had to replace it at $60. I would have never paid that much if it were for myself.,2.0
"It has very strong smell , I hope its safe to use this bottle to drink water ! I like size of bottle.",2.0
The dimensions were either not noted or incorrect.  I wish I had read previous reviews.  This is TINY.  No way it will function as a weekly planner for anyone with a LIFE.  VERY disappointed.,2.0
The cost isn't worth it with the issues it has. The pull of the straw is difficult. It makes weird noises when bringing water to surface. It leaks from the tip.,2.0
I was misperceptions about this book. It's too small for a gift. Even if I use it as note. I just give it to the kids. But the price somehow make me so disappointed order this thing.,2.0
"Im not really impressed with the quality of the wildlife series. The pattern that comes with it is HUGE and very poorly done with no detail and the instructions a poorly written and not helpful at all, unless you already know how to paint wildlife.

Installed and seems to be working okay.,2.0
much smaller than expected.  cannot use as serving pieces.,2.0
The tray came broken but I didn't order for that so it wasn't a big deal. The bowls were a little small I was hoping to use for onions and salsa but spoons didn't sit well in. All in all good price and made well just too small and need to be shipped safer.,2.0

"Previous reviews of ""Sturdy"" ""Made of Metal"" etc.  must have been written by Millennials or people under the age of 30 that have no experience or understanding of what a good product used to be.

This shower head is 100% plastic.  There is part that is plated with ""Chrome"" like any old model car kit would have.  Plastic is not sturdy or a ""well made"" product's material when it is used in this capacity.

Not what was expected at all.  It does have a nice spray pattern, but the component will deteriorate like any plastic shower head does, I am certain of that, we have no 20 years experience with sub-american standard ""plastic"" plumbing components and they all prematurely fail.",2.0
"So the scale works very well, but I am giving it 2 stars because most of the time the scale doesn't work at all. It uses a CR2032 battery which just don't hold much power to begin with. This would be okay EXCEPT that this thing clearly uses power even when it appears to be off. I only use this scale every now and then but it feels like every time I pick it up the battery is dead. So the scale is fine, when it works...so if you are going to buy this go ahead and prepurchase a dozen or so CR2032 batteries to get you through the first year or so...that about how many by my guestimate you will need if you use it often. This scale would have been much better suited with AAA or AA batteries.",2.0
"Either the packaging was bad or the base just broke easy.  I ordered two of this, first time both were packaged inside a big box, both bases were broken.  When the replacement order arrived, both were shipped in it's own packaging only (no special wrapping), also both bases were broken.  Don't know what to make of this.  Looks pretty on the web page, although I never had a chance to open the package to see it (all were broken inside the package upon arrival).

Update:  Still broken upon arrival after 2nd sets of replacement.",2.0
"I bought these lock-&-seal dishes for me and two for gifts.  The dishes have chipped badly and unsafe to use.  I have had to throw sevral away.  Even thought they were used and stored properly, they still chipped.  Very disapointing and they were not cheap.",2.0
The stamp is nice enough but size it stamps is well less than an inch. It is pretty pricey considering the size of the stamp. The picture on the website was misleading.,2.0
"I got a completely different color than the photo shows, and it's not pretty at all! Also, I agree with the previous reviewer that the ribbon closure is too thin - with use, it won't last at all. Very disappointing for the price.",2.0
"The idea is good but it's not sturdy as I thought it would be, and the thin ribbon is a very cheap closure.",2.0
"These dishes look really cute in my kitchen and the product reviews were pretty favorable - as long as you happened to receive the sets made in the USA and not China.  I purchased two dish sets and some accessory pieces and - because of the rather steep price - assumed they were American made.  Wrong.  Sadly, several of the dishes chipped when first washed in the dishwasher and more dishes chipped from use in the microwave - clearly these are not dishwasher and microwave safe. Extremely poor quality - don't be fooled by the high price!",2.0

"This calendar is smaller than I expected and the corner was bent.

"I like the cover and the size.  I wish they showed a photo of the ""exposed binding"".  I am really unhappy with that aspect of this planner.  I actually initially thought that something was wrong with it.  You can see the glue, it is very unattractive.  I am gong to keep an eye out for another planner because I don't expect this one to make it for a year.",2.0
The cover and design are cute but there is not nearly enough space to write anything in the monthly calendars.,2.0
"I like the Do It All wall calendars, and also Orange Circle products in general, but this disappointed.  The colors inside were very faded, which made the print job look very low quality.  Considering how many free calendars there are, I expect one I pay for to be higher quality.",2.0
"Thumbs down. I thought this would be the same as the Moms Plan-it I bought the past several years, but it's not. Thin paper quality means total bleed through - the calendar is ruined, and bc I wrote in it, I can't return. The layout is good, but it's unusable to me because of the paper quality. Totally bummed.",2.0
"I am so disappointed, I really want to love this planner. It is a perfect size and I love that its bound, not by the annoying metal spiral that catches on everything but like a book. I love the look, artwork and paper material. The monthly pages are beautiful and have plenty of space but as I guess I misunderstood also, in the description it clearly says, ""monthly calendar grids, week-per-page views and lots of space to write."" Yes for monthly calendar grids and lots of space to write but there is definitely not week-per-page views which I need for writing down more daily details. So disappointed.",2.0
"Did not like the fact that the month at a glance, week at a glance, the to do and grocery lists are all in separate sections of the book.  Much more user-friendly if they're all together.",2.0
"I ordered this product and the first one that came was completely unusable (the dates were crazy messed up) I sent in a complaint... ordered a new one, but was then annoyed because I had to pay to send the messed up one back! This company should reimburse me the $5 to send it back. Got the new one and everything was in working order.... then the strap popped off after using it for 3 weeks (the strap was one of the reasons in went with this product) It's cute.. came in reasonable time frame... but kinda big for a purse) Needless to say I won't order from this company again.",2.0
"This dosage of melatonin was recommended by a naturopath to help address a brain tumor. A different brand was recommended by the doctor, which induces sleep very well, even to the point of struggling to wake up in the morning. That brand is more expensive, so to save money, we tried this one. Sadly, the product was a waste of money. Many nights of sleep have been lost. It might have been better than none at all, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars. We are now going back to the more expensive brand.",2.0
"Its nice, but mine has a lot of black scratches and scuffs. They didn't put it in a bag or anything, just in the box with a some airbags. May not work well with small rice, but works fine with long rice",2.0

"I was looking forward to trying this potato masher because multiple online recipe sources advise to use a masher instead of electric mixer to mash your potatoes because the sharp blades from a mixer break down the starches and make your mashed potatoes gummy.  As a masher, this product does the job and with a good amount of man power I was able to mash my potatoes and I did like the texture better than when I use my electric mixer.

Why two stars though, well because I guess I am going to be able to only use this product once because the material it is made from is inferior.  Even though the product description says this item is dishwasher safe, when I left the masher in my pot to soak for a few hours it still RUSTED in a few places.  Now I have a masher that is probably going to go straight into the trash because I don't want the rust to transfer to my food.  This shouldn't happen so easily to stainless steel, especially ""heavy duty"" as it claims.  Also, I hate the peeler that came with this product.  It doesn't glide as easily when it peels and the handle is clunky - I prefer my plain plastic handle peeler. This product was a huge miss for me.

"I purchased 4 of these measured the resistance between the center and outer conductors. The results where disappointing. 1 measured 1.5 M ohms, 2 measured about 20 M ohms, and 1 measured 33 M ohms. This is disappointing and seems to come from the BNC connector.",2.0

These were alright just made my pants to loose and didn't hold up my pants right. They worked good for a little while but then my pants slid down to much and the zipper never staid up so I bought a belly band.,2.0

"I received this shower curtain on time and was thrilled by the color and pattern.  However, the shower curtain did not have any openings for shower hooks so it is unusable.  I have to return it, and its doubtful I'll be able to replace it since it is out of stock. Very disappointing.",2.0
Works just a little better than the bare hand.  It does not do anything to really ease the removal of the stopper.  You do have a better grip which make is somewhat easier but I though it would have some type of leverage action to assist in the removal but it does not.  You still have to do a heck of a lot of twisting and pulling to get the stopper out of the bottle.,2.0
"Too big for me ,it doesn't fit in my every day bag",2.0
I saw all the great reviews about this knife so I purchased two of them. When I recieved them both were very sharp but after using them for a two weeks they are as dull and most of my other knives.,2.0
"I have permed hair which tends to be on the dry side, this product got good reviews so I decided to try it. For a product formulated for curls you would think it would condition very well, I was not impressed at all I have tried a lot more products that do a way better job than this. My hair felt dry after I rinsed it out, the conditioner is not much better. But I do love the fact it uses a lot of natural ingredients, but I'm looking for more conditioning than what this offers!",2.0
"I ordered two of these timers and was disappointed when one of them arrived broken in the box.  I e-mailed the vendor to ask how to return the item and how the replacement would be sent.  I received no return e-mail from the vendor, so I ended up paying $10 for a $2.50 item.  Very disappointing!",2.0
"We were going on a two week vacation to Europe and I needed to get something to keep our tomatoes from dying. Well, they survived, but barely. And I am not sure whether that was due to the little bit of rain or the driwater. All I can say is that I followed the directions as best as I could (I am an engineer) and after two weeks, the gel was still there and the plants were on the brink of extinction.",2.0
"This sharpener comes with the ability to sharpen both knives and scissors (both left handed and right handed). It is lightweight and portable.

To operate the sharpener you must 1st flip down the guard (see picture above). This guard does not lock but there is a notch that it falls into once opened. Too much pressure and the guard will slip out of the notch and collapse the sharpener while in use. The sharpener is not free standing and requires a hand on it to keep it upright while sharpening. At best, this is somewhat ackward.

The angle at which to hold the knife while sharpening is a best guess. Although the sharpener's blade design is V-shaped(see picture above), which allows the knife to fit into the groove, there is still room for slippage while pulling the knife through which can scrape and scar the side of the knife.

The knife sharpener has a ""course"" side and a ""fine"" side (see picture above). Those with damaged and knicked blades use the course side then finish with the fine side. Those just ""touching up"" a blade that is already sharp with only use the fine.

Although I tried to sharpen a pair of right handed scissors using this sharpener, I did not notice any change after 2 or 3 pulls. I did have success sharpening knives. Although I found it ackward to bend over the sharpener trying to keep it steady while pulling the knife through.

Yes, the company succeeded in designing a knife sharpener. However, it is unsteady and it requires some skill to hold and operate at the same time.",2.0
Really small pocket chart. Quite useless.,2.0
It did not have as many pockets as the picture showed.,2.0
Smaller than expected.,2.0
Do not buy this. It's very small and holds very little for the price. Was able to return with no problem.,2.0
"I assumed this would be a pretty sizable pocket chart, but I was pretty disappointed when I received the item. I read other's reviews and didn't realize just how SMALL it actually was (and with this size... I could have easily gotten something cheaper at Target or Dollar Tree). I teach prek sdc and therefore do not utilize common core, so maybe it was partially my fault for assuming these common core cards would be bigger. Anyway, for future buyers, the size of this chart is 13"" x 14"". Yes, a bit bigger than a size of a regular ruler.  Avoid buying if you are looking for something bigger...",2.0
I am very  disappointed...far too small your advertisement of this product was misleading..too small for my classroom I probably will not be able to utilize this product.,2.0
I noticed that it did not have all of the CCSS in math in my package. I am disappointed it was missing it,2.0
The cards are too small for students to read.,2.0
"My district requires us to post the standards or ""I Can"" statements for the children to see and read.  These are way too small and I will be returning them..",2.0
I can't really see the purpose of using these cards since the writing is probably a size 16 font.  It seems crazy to even post them on the wall.  Clearly a money maker due to administration requiring standards being posted.,2.0
I am very disappointed!!!!!! The pocket chart is too small for usage in my classroom...The print and size of the cards ..the same..very disappointed...Your advertisement of both products..extremely misleading.......,2.0
"I  am required to post I can statements each day and ordered this item thinking it would save me work and free up board space.  It is my fault as I read te measurements of the cards and thought they would work, but when I hang the cards up the students can not read them.  They are too small.  My principal came in and sad my statements weren't posted and did not think they were acceptable when I disputed her.  As I said, it is my fault as the cards do show their measurements but do be aware that students can not read the statements unless right up at the board.",2.0

"I LOVE the scriptures on each page. At night it helps me reflect on the day I had, and to clear my head. I have to say, I was/am really disappointed with the type of paper. EVERY SINGLE PEN I used, ""ran out of ink."" I was so happy I didn't throw out my pens that didn't work, because it WAS the paper, NOT my pens! I had to keep a whole stack of different pens by night stand, and eventually everyone of them stopped writing. Now, I have been using the papermate flair markers... MARKERS. That is the only writing utensil that will work consistently.",2.0

"The most basic, pedestrian calendar. Ever. Spend the extra few bucks.",2.0
"The pictures are fine, but when I write on the calendar part, the ink from the next image bleeds through onto the following months, so you have ghost images of all your January appointments on February and March, etc.  Not recommended.",2.0
Product arrived damaged and the shipping box was fine. The corners of the calendar were smashed in and I was not going to look at that for a year. The pictures looked nice but I have not ordered another as the trouble of having to go through another return process if the item arrives damaged is not worth it.,2.0
paper not very high quality,2.0
"I love the layout and look of this product.  I hate how inflexible it is.  The pages can only be written on with a ballpoint pen or else you will have to wait some time for the ink to dry on the glossy paper.  The pages don't bend well and I think the construction is a little cheap.  Regardless, for a casual or younger journaler, I would be okay putting my name behind this.",2.0
"I homeschool my grandson. I ordered this because of high reviews on this program for kids with sensory issues, but I don't like it. The style is not attractive, and it was not easier for him to master. After trying this for a year, I have switched to something else that. I sometimes pull this out for the content and produce worksheet so that the writing can be done in the style I prefer. In fairness, there are many homeschool parents that love this and feel it works well for their child. I think people should always choose what works in their own situation when it comes to books for teaching. Children are different, and this may be perfect for your child.  I have no problem with the way the material is presented, just with the boxy, hard to read cursive style.",2.0
"We have used these books for our cyber school for the past 4 years.  The print books were fine, but I thought they made things too complicated and I don't like the way it uses 2 lines - the top line is used for the middle of the tall letters, so when kids using this cross over to regular ruled paper, they are confused as to where the letters are supposed to go.  I really don't like the cursive programs, either, because they don't flow well, and I didn't like how some of the letters are formed.",2.0
"I probably should have checked the dimensions, but this was much larger and bulkier than I expected. Excessive pages, too. I'm sure it's right for someone, just not me.",2.0
"The wire binding won't hold the back cover in place, so it keeps pulling out.  Not remotely durable enough for a journal that is supposed to go on camping trips.",2.0
"The first time we bought this it worked out great and my wife filled the journal.  So we ordered it again July 2017 expecting to get the same ""Camping - The Camper's Journal"" but this time we are disappointed to see that the back side of the pages now has a photo paste in spot that takes up half the page.  This is supposed to be writing journal and the photo space takes away from that.  We are now checking RV stores for old copies of the original, good version that has journal lines on the back instead of a big fat blank photo square.  We will most likely return this this less desirable New version back to Amazon.

How to Tell:  Old version is inscribed with 3 lines on the cover ""Memories Are All That's Left, Live, Love, Laugh"".  In the same lower right corner, new version simply says ""Write It Down!""",2.0
"At the top it should be noted that I have not bought or tested this product, but what I have to say is as follows:  I'm skeptical of the first five star review (which at the time of writing this is the only review). It seems like it was written by the company/seller, and not by an actual buyer. In fact, if you look at other reviews for similar products put out by the same company/seller, you'll notice that it is almost identical to other first reviews given (even word for word). Hmm... seems fishy to me. I was going to buy one, but this has warded me off.",2.0
I bought this map and its so small from the picture its nearly impossible to tell its not in English. Extremely disappointed. It should definitely state clearly that it is not in English!,2.0
"Thought I'd add that mine was in French, too. So annoying. Didn't realize till Christmas Day.",2.0
Where does it say that it would be in French?  A good map with good pictures of the animals but totally not understandable for those who do not speak French!  Very disappointing in that it was to be a gift.,2.0

"Not what I expected.  I didn't realize it was a tear and rip off calendar with no back pocket.  Not sure why this lesser item is more expensive than their other one with the spiral binding and back pocket.  Admittedly, I ordered the wrong one but I really don't like this one.  Their other one is sturdier and offers the back pocket which I use all the time.  Now that I've made this mistake I'll be more careful next time and be sure I get the right one.",2.0
Nice calendar but the pages are thin. I like to use markers and I can't with this calendar. The marker shows through on the other side.,2.0
Ok so I love the big spaces to keep organized. This is why I bought the calender. To be honest though I'm surprised that it has so many 5 star reviews. The paper is super flimsy and thin for the price. I doubt it will last till the end of the year. And it has so many extra months. They should get rid of those and get better paper. Also I keep track of things by highlighting important events so they stand out. The highlighter bleeds through! So disappointed. First wall calender I've ever had to bleed through like that.,2.0
"I was hoping to find a giant mouse pad to cover all the scratch marks from our laptops constantly moving around a painted desktop.  I thought this was the perfect size to put a laptop on, but the surface was not smooth at all - it buckled as if the map was pulling up from the mouse pad material.  It made it nearly impossible to use it as a writing surface, and we just gave up, and stored it away :(",2.0

"The product, Majestic Rainbow Bible Tabs, sounds like a pleasant encounter with willing partner. There is nothing majestic, magic, or other wise pleasant or willing about the product. The product is printed bible book labels that must be cut to the correct length; separated from the paper media used to keep  the adhesive backing from  joining together; then apply that label  to the thin page of your bible.  This is a very time taking and laborious task.  I can only recommend that if it your desire to have a tabulated bible, buy a tabulated bible in the first place and forgo having to apply this product to your bible's thin pages.  This product is a very unforgiving and difficult to apply.  Once applied , the tab cannot be adjusted or removed without tearing the pages of your bible.  In short - it sucks!!!",2.0

"The one with the screen is better. This one is difficult to figure out what you are doing especially if you are in a class with a lot of people. Seems like it would be more useful in highschool where the classes are small. For college, it would probably be better to get with the screen. When it arrived, it was a little worn and the batteries were dead - which you need a scew driver to open to install the batteries and the batteries are also no included. Wouldn't buy again - especially for 40$ + , would be better to fork over the extra 20$ or whatever for the one with the screen to see what I'm doing.",2.0

"This product works fine of course and does exactly as it is suppose to. However, as most people will be purchasing this for college, there is no reason for this little thing to be $50.

The real problem I had was that the clicker turns off randomly and won't come back on til the brand new batteries I put in it are taken out and put back in. This has happened about 3 times now. I simply can't depend on it for class. This product is going back. Don't buy used for the internet on this product.",2.0

I was disappointed when I realized that there is a clue (colored line) on the front of the pictures that helps children figure out the correct sequence.

There is no way you can get anything resembling the images shown in the product photo unless you are an artist, and if that were the case you wouldn't need the stencils. For instance, the images of the cats turn out looking vaguely like a cat, but the ears and paws are barely recognizable. As other reviewers have stated, the stencils are kind of flimsy which requires a lot of equal pressure around all of the edges in order to get a decent outline. Also, the storage box will tip over unless you very carefully place the stencils inside to create the perfect balance.
I would not recommend for anyone-child or adult. In addition, they are overpriced for what you get.",2.0

She handed them back and asked for the old ones back.  They are way overpriced. I would not have purchased them in a store if I could have seen them first.  They will probably be donated to local thrift store.",2.0
"Had I seen the product in person, I would not have paid more than about $5 for it.  The stencils are only 3.5"" tall and 5.5"" wide.  Images are so small for coloring.  This is why I rarely shop on-line - you never know what quality you'll get.  I will keep anyway to see how my niece likes them.

The holding case is yellow and not blue.  One good thing is the outer case says Made in the USA!  I wish all items on Amazon would have an indicator of where it is made so we would know prior to buying.

"The seller sent this map in a tube, but bent both sideds to fit into a box.  Then when I took it out I could see very bend in the paper.

"BEWARE!  When I opened first cartridge, it gushed ink all over my hand and onto the floor.  Had I not been standing on tile, I (and my landlord) would have been very angry.  Two days later, my hand is still stained, but it's getting better.  The floor is fine.  Since three of the cartridges I opened all did the same thing, I'm going to assume that this is a consistent error.  Lame.

However, I think I did figure out the problem, and how to avoid it: In addition to the large orange guard on the underside, there is a small yellow tab on top which must be removed prior to use.  Nothing in the packaging indicates that these need to be done in any particular order, but I believe that you must remove the small tab on top FIRST to avoid making a huge mess when removing the orange guard.  The ones that I did in this order didn't drip nearly as much as the ones where I removed the guard first.

The ink itself seems to be fine, but I can't give it more than two stars because of the leakage problem.  Two days, two showers, and two sets of dishes later, and my hand is still stained...",2.0

"This is a nice, convenient little planner, in a convenient size, and nicely formatted for flexible use.  However, it is quite costly for what you get. Sadly, after buying this for my 18yo son, we were browsing in the dollar store, and he found a similarly formatted planner, of comparable quality, and slightly larger in size, that he liked better (a bit more flexible for planning and a bit more room to write), so this one was abandoned.  I felt it was a waste of $13. I have since been using it as an expense tracker--but again, I could have gotten this at the dollar store! I don't have many expenses as a stay-at-home mama--just once or twice a week to a grocery store, a handful of online purchases, and another errand or two every couple weeks. And that is enough information to fill up this little book!

I like the blank pages on the right hand side of each open spread. Great for notes! But that is the same format we found in the dollar planner, too!  I also like the elastic closure that holds this shut in a neat, tidy little book.  The dollar version does not have this.

This is certainly a nice little planner, but my recommendation would have to be: Go to the dollar store.",2.0
"OK, so I'm probably impaired when reading an item's dimensions and envisioning exactly how big the item will be when it arrives; but my goodness, based on size alone, this was terribly overpriced.  Moleskine tends to be not a bargain for any item, so I should have expected it; but as I said, my goodness.  What a puny little thing, about the size of a checkbook.  And it cost what, over thirteen dollars?  Gracious.",2.0
"I've used Moleskin planners for a couple of years, now. I accidentally picked up the 12-month, when I was expecting an 18-month. Ok. I can deal with that.

The weekly layout is the perfection I expected. One week per page with a lined page opposite. I use this page for reminders, to-dos and random notes. I stick post it notes to that side with my grocery list. It's perfect.

But, the monthly pages in the front are much different than previous versions. I believe I read that this was changed in both the 12 and 18 month planners for 2013. I wanted and needed a full page for each month with the typical grid layout. I plan my long term projects in these pages. What it has is a measly line per day: two columns per page, one month per column. I guess they're trying to save money by reducing the number of pages. It's not so easy to look at, for example, every Monday anymore.

I'll give this a shot for the year, but if next year's planner is the same I'll have to find another provider.",2.0
"The journal itself has super cool interior usable pages. However, mine came with a VERY unattractive cover that says ""Avocados from Mexico - The World's Finest"".

Compared to its price... this Moleskine is too thin. But I only give two star because it has a good quality of paper... the paper makes you write often.. I originally planned to write my schedule and doodling... (I am a student).. I would recommend just a normal moleskine.. but the cover has a great color.. though,2.0
"The Moleskine is a well designed product.  The week is listed on the left and a full blank page for other quick notes on the right.  The pocket on the back inside flap is great for all the little bits of detritus and receipts that seem to get collected as the year goes by.

There are all sorts of sites on-line that offer great hint for 'hacking' the notebook to make it even more functional.  There is a great hack for adding a pen holder to the spine via duct tape (or gaffer tape if one prefers).  Super. Cool. If one could use it immediately.  The problem is that when the shrink-wrap is taken off of the new Moleskine, you notice an odd smell.

The new book smells so bad that I had to leave it out in the garage for nearly a week sitting upright with the pages fanned apart to get the smell out.  If you look at the ordering page here at Amazon, you'll notice a Proposition 65 warning.  Prop 65 was written to give consumers a warning when anything that goes into a product might be hazardous to the population's health. The Moleskines, currently made in China, uses the chemical DEHP (Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate), a type of plastic softener. It is the source of the smell. I feel sorry for the workers that have to be around this chemical on a daily basis--it really stinks.

This will be the last Moleskine for me, I will try the PaperBlank model for 2011. Or perhaps I'll try the Rhodia planner. Too bad, I was just getting used to the format too.",2.0
"I finally bought into the preppy hype surrounding Moleskine when I needed an unlined notebook for a special project. The first thing I noticed when I received it was how thin it is for a 240-page book--about 5/8"" thick. I opened it and found out why: the pages are ridiculously thin for a journal/notebook. I'm hesitant to use anything but a light pencil on them, and, really, what point is there to a notebook that must be tiptoed through with writing instruments? The cover is decent (for textured cardboard) and the pocket on the inner back cover is nifty, but the paper is ridiculously low-quality. If these are the ""legendary notebooks"" that Moleskine touts, the legend is definitely overblown.",2.0

I will probably just use it for rough sketches for future works. I'm going to stick with Canson paper since it is made here in the U.S.A. anyways, not farmed out to China. Lesson learned!",2.0
"It's not terrible. But it's not great either. While this would warrant a three-star review, because the brand is Moleskine, a brand that has prided itself in quality, it's getting a two.

Like much of the old guard who had older Moleskine notebooks before they were ubiquitous in every stationary store, I very much miss the older books. I'm down to one older one (There was a period I once hoarded some from a sale) and decided to purchase a new one since it had been a while while on a trip (At a Moleskine store no less) - As soon as I started sketching in it something felt off from the familiar texture I'm used to. Attributing it to being because it's new, I let it go.

Once I got home though, I did compare it against my old Moleskine. Like a lot of reviewers, I noticed on a side by side comparison that the paper was definitely thinner in the new one. Putting them side by side you can see with how the binding is and the difference in height that the new Moleskine uses thinner paper. While for pen and ink a lot of it is irrelevant, I do wonder how it will take acrylics, I've used them a lot with older notebooks with the only problem being the usual curling you get with wet media and a thinner paper. I'll try to update this review when I do use acrylic on the new one. The new ones still do not take alcohol-inked based markers very well and bleed through just as much as the older ones, so Copics and Prismacolors are still a no go. And I had the opposite reaction of the paper texture. While some reviewers said the new notebook was toothier in the grain, I think it was the exact opposite and was a little TOO smooth.

Another thing I noticed was the color of the paper wasn't the old dark cream of old and is a lot brighter - This is something that is more of an aesthetic preference and doesn't really impact the overall notebook, but I still prefer the old darker cream. The other thing is the cover doesn't feel like it has as much give to it. The cover reminds me a lot of Picadilly's brand of notebooks.

Overall, it feels cheaper to me, and while I'll use this new one I now have, I'm not sure if I'll be buying them again considering the price point vs. the quality.",2.0

If I wanted orange, I would have ordered that. If you don't care if it's not truly red, buy it. Still a great journal. Amazon, are you (or your vendors) selling off defects again? Wouldn't be the first time I've received lesser quality without any notification. Grrr.",2.0
"To those who are reading this review, you may think that I'm being picky--but if you tried the older paper, before it was changed, I think you would feel the same. I'm just sad for those who buy this, and are missing out on what the Moleskine quality meant to me and others who tasted the fruits of what was once an amazing product.

I was given a moleskine sketchbook that was purchased years ago, but was brand new and still wrapped. I LOVED it. It's my favorite sketchbook and I've got my best drawings in there. The paper brought out so much of my freedom and creativity--I didn't have to fight my media at all. So, of course, I got another one! A red one. And immediately, I noticed the paper didn't take the media as well as the old one. It just feels more similar to cheaper sketchbooks I own. Very disappointed. I even put them next to each other and tried out all of the same pencils I was using, as well as pen and my aquash brush. The new one takes pen okay, but the paper is harsher. It takes pencils, but not HALF as smoothly as the old. The paper is also much whiter. I hope Moleskine goes back to its lovely cream-colored paper. I loved the way it took graphite, pen, and wash. Until then, I don't think I'll be buying another one, unfortunately.",2.0
"Way too small to actually use, at least for me it is.",2.0
"Quality of paper is marginal at best....very thin. Be careful what kind of pen you use, since the ink almost goes through to the other side!

I guess I'm disappointed since I thought this was a quality product with a name that is well known.",2.0
"I love these notebooks but I am dissatisfied with the quality of the paper. As others have said, the paper is thin and results in bleedthrough very often. I use Staedtler fineliners and they show through even the lightest strokes. I love the feel of the cover and that it is a hardcover but the thin paper is a big downfall. This would be a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the paper, which in my opinion is the biggest part. I love the pocket, the elastic to keep the cover closed and the bookmark but the thin paper forces me to skip a page every time so I can only use half of my notebook. I won't be buying this again unfortunately.",2.0
"I love Molskine notebooks, and I love the reporter notebooks... but this one is not my favorite. After buying this one I realized that one of the main reasons that I like the Moleskine reporters is that they are easy to write on pretty much in any situation.

"I've been using moleskin for YEARS ever since purchasing my first red book on a whim, saving up for the right time to buy one. I fell in love with that book. To this day it's probably one of my favorite completed journals. The quality of the paper was such that it just beckoned to be drawn on.

I decided to buy another red book because I love the flashy color and I'd hoped to create another beautiful book. To my dismay drawing in it felt a lot different. I went to look at my old book and notices a very drastic difference.

The GSM of the paper in the new book is WAAAYYYY lighter than my old book.  This basically means in order to cut down on production costs, they skimped on their paper weight at the cost of you, the loyal consumer.

I'd been a fan of these books for so long... but ever since they've switched gears towards a more commercial, less professional marketing strategy, I'm wondering if I can really keep buying these for the purpose of making art. Taking notes, yes... but the quality of these books is not for drawing anymore sad to say. :I",2.0

For years I wondered what the hype was about Moleskine so I finally ordered their larger book. It's awful! The paper warps so bad and I bought a watercolor book. I had to tape the pages down by wrapping it ove to the hard cover and still the warping was so bad that color would run off humps and into valleys so that I had no control. I went back to Pentalic's Aqua Journal and will never buy anything else again. This is just awful and way over privpced for what I received. Yuck.,2.0
"The item came perfectly packaged, so I was disappointed when I opened the cellophane wrapping to find that three pages had areas of the paper peeled back like it had been shaved off by machinery. The folios are very loosely bound, and while this normally wouldn't be a problem the pages slip around and want to lift up from the spine; I'm worried about pages being torn out while the sketchbook is in my bag.

Those seem to just be manufacturing errors, but there is also some misleading writing on the packaging that says there are ""60 pages"" in this sketchbook. Well, that's if you count front AND back. There are 60 surfaces that you could feasibly paint or draw on, but only 30 actual sheets. Even then, two of those sheets are glued to the free-end pages (the paper that covers the internal face of the book covers) for about a centimeter. Yes, I understand why this is done (for structural integrity) but for a sketchbook, it makes it QUITE AWKWARD to attempt to draw on those sides of the pages, let alone paint with a medium such as watercolor, so I wouldn't include those two faces in the page count.

Aside from that, the paper quality is pretty good, it could be a little heavier for a book of this size. The elastic strap is helpful as always, and I somehow end up sticking something in the pocket in the back. I hope Moleskine will listen to their customer's complaints and improve the quality of the design, I understand there will always be duds when manufacturing en masse, but for the former industry standard, Moleskine needs to step up their game.",2.0

I used the Moleskine version for about two weeks and I will probably end up throwing it away.  The pages are so thin that regular ball-point pens go right through the pages.  The primary reason that I like the blank page is to make tons of notes and lists each week, but then it all bleeds through and makes the next week's schedule hard to read.  No fun.

"I used to love the Moleskine cahiers for their performance in regards to their price, but as of this purchase, it appears Moleskine has changed the product for the worse. Feathering, which was never a problem for me before, has rendered these notebooks unusable with even the thickest of inks.

If you are using pencil or ball point pens, then buy these notebooks, they are still good paper for the price, but if you use a fountain pen of any sort, its probably best to stick with the more expensive brands.",2.0

It won't absorbed at all, so there is one thing you can use it on and that think. And so are graphite will rub off, watercolor just won't work, what's the point? This was expensive. I would have thought at least they would have given me some good paper but no",2.0
The dimensions ....so ....so very small.  For about 3 dollars each these two little notebooks can't really justify the price tag.  Not more than 30 sheets....and again tiny.  But if you need a spendy little notebook that will fit in any pocket....this will fit in any pocket,2.0
"When I first got the moleskin pen it wrote great; the original ink cartridge was flawless and wrote smoothly. I don't know if my issue with this replacement cartridge is an isolated incident but the ink flow is horrible, even on Moleskin paper. No matter how slowly, quickly, firmly, or gently I write, the rollerball dries and rewets every couple seconds. At the steep price, I'm not willing to buy another cartridge to see if this one was a fluke.

I know I've made it sound more complicated than it actually is, but I do hope someone can tell Moleskine to make a planner that goes from January to June of the following year to avoid this awkward situation.",2.0

You can't read what you wrote because you can't see what line on the the staff it's located on. That's the whole point of this book! I use my books to scan into my computer for charts. The lines are so light that they don't even scan! I was trying to read my chart today in a session and I kept screwing up because I couldn't see the lines on the page. That's ridiculous. Otherwise, it's pretty good, good size, plane black color. I also wish that it had staff paper on both sides.

Who knew some people like to write music on only the right side?  I didn't.

"I've been using the standard Moleskine sketchbook for quite some time.  I use it for journaling and drawing in ink, plus coloring pencils.  I've traveled with it for years and have always found it to be a great sketchbook.

My only complaint with the smaller sketchbook is its size--sometimes it's nice, sometimes I'd like to do something larger.  Thus the A4 Folio Sketchbook.  When I got it it seemed huge, but I've since gotten used to it and enjoy all the extra space.  I'd be working in this book for the next year or two were it not for the paper quality.  I use the same archival drawing pens I have always used and have never had a problem with, but in the A4 they are constantly smearing.  I just smeared ink I had drawn TWO DAYS ago.  My hands have ink smudges on them as well as the page.

I thought maybe a high priced sketchbook would equate to decent paper quality as I have found with other Moleskines (decent--not fantastic) but sadly that's not the case.",2.0
"If you get a good copy, this is a great notebook, but there seems to be a lot of sample variation here. I've bought four of these.

"Why fix what ain't broke, Moleskine? The whole reason I bought this was for the block calendars, and now they are gone. I wish I had read reviews FIRST. The size is perfect for my bag, but the new line design is going to be much more inconvenient when planning out my monthly schedules. Boo.",2.0
"I've been using the standard Ruled Moleskine notebook as a daily work journal for years. I typically start a new page on a new day, start with a To Do list of what's up for the day, and take notes during meetings from there below. I thought the layout of this Professional Notebook was interesting, as it had a sidebar for a To Do list, and some other sections. Ultimately, I found it too restrictive for my needs.

By far the most disappointing thing was the quality of the paper. I write with a fountain pen, and the ink bled through the paper as if I was writing with a permanent marker. In my experience with the standard Ruled Notebook, their core product, the ink does not bleed through the paper.

Moleskine was prompt to reply to my quality complaint. They noted that none of their pages are really suited for fountain pens--but it was clear from my experience that the paper in this book is a bit different, perhaps thinner, than in standard books. I must note that Moleskine offered to send me a Ruled Notebook as a replacement. Great company, but was not pleased with this particular product.

If you write with a ""dry ink,"" as Moleskine recommended, you will likely not notice a difference with the quality of the paper.",2.0
"Not very impressed with the quality of this paper. I also thought it was the thicker sketchbook paper, but that's my fault for not realizing it wasn't. Still though, I can't even use pen without it showing through the other side. I guess this would be good for pencil, but not good for pen or marker or most writing mediums. I have purchased the art sketchbooks & like them a lot better. If you're just going to write in it then I would say it is an ok product. I think the paper quality could be better though. I like the elastic closure & pocket in the back.",2.0
"The Moleskine Professional Notebook, like the Folio series, differs from the so-called Moleskine classic series insofar as the type of paper used. The professional and folio notebooks appear to use a different type of paper than is used in the regular notebooks. The paper in this notebook appears glossy and doesn't accept rollerball ink, including the ink used in Moleskine's own rollerball pen with its ""specially designed ink"". Secondly, the paper feels flimsy with some bleed through, again using the Moleskine rollerball pen as well as the Kaweco classic rollerball. The overall construction of the notebook, at least this particular one that I have, is also shoddy. The concept of the professional notebook is attractive, but I will go back to the regular series, or switch to the Leucchturm notebooks.",2.0

Stay away from this one.",2.0
"I love my Moleskine--but not the 2012-2013 18 month planner. They have redesigned the front calendars. Instead of the typical ""block"" calendars they have in the front of the book, they have created a vertical list of each day in the month. There are no boxes in the calendar, and this makes it very hard for me to plan. I will end up printing out my own traditional block calendars and pasting them in the book.

Buyer beware--if you want the block calendars and get this planner, you'll need to make your own.

I'm so disappointed. Unless they change the format for 2013-2014, I'll be hunting for the ""perfect"" planner again. :(",2.0
Since moving production to china the paper quality has gotten lighter by 1/3 it seems - no where near the body and weight of the paper when the book was being made in Italy! Also the binding has been modified ... All in all disappointing...,2.0
"First off, I love this sketchbook - seriously. It's my favorite one on earth that isn't hand bound/made by some obscure book binder or something.  So just know that upon reading this review.  This review is NOT negative because of the quality of the product, rather it is negative because of my experience.  I hope that by telling what happened to me, you can make an educated decision about whether or not to buy this product from Amazon.

I ordered 2 of these sketchbooks from Amazon LLC.  I received 1 traditional bound (on the left) and one top-bound. So I ordered 2 of the same sketchbook, and received two different ones.  Oh well, not like I need them for work or anything (I do, in fact need them for work, and my work requires specific parameters for my sketchbooks).  So I wrote Amazon for a replacement and a shipping label to send the wrong one back.  No biggie, right? I actually got a great response from Amazon:
""Hello,

I'm sorry to hear that one of your sketchbook is different and it's top bound. This usually doesn't happen. I'd love to help you with this.

I've placed a new order for you at no charge for the correct sketchbook. I've also upgraded the shipping method to One-Day Shipping at no additional charge.""

So - yea, awesome! great customer service, right? yea.
I hastily received the replacement sketchbook, opened the package and IT WAS THE SAME WRONG SKETCHBOOK!
So I had Amazon call me, and I spoke with an honest to god person who was very considerate.  Unfortunately because the product has now been placed ""Under Review"" I could not arrange for my purchased item to be sent to me.  So I can't get this sketchbook that I need for work - from Amazon.  BUT they offered me a full refund and I get to keep both of the wrong sketchbooks.  So all is well I suppose.

Just wanted to share my customer service experience with you all here.  Take with it whatever you want.  I did get some ""free stuff"" but I certainly didn't get what I ordered.

So in conclusion, although I am not satisfied with this product offered though Amazon because of the aggravating complications, I highly recommend the sketchbook itself and had a decent experience with customer service.  There ya go.

Thanks for reading!",2.0
"I really don't get it.  These aren't worth the cost. $11 for 3? The paper is thin, isn't particularly good quality, and the notebooks themselves aren't robustly constructed.",2.0
"I love my moleskin notebook, and bought this pencil as a supplement, but was disappointed with this for the price.  I didn't read reviews just added to my cart, but as others have pointed out, no eraser for a 15 dollar pencil?  Also, I have the professional moleskin, and it doesn't lay flat against the notebook, it sticks out.  I would recommend the zebra M-301 click pencils, cheaper, and works really well with this notebook, plus can attach to notebook, comes with 3 leads, and an eraser.",2.0
"I usually don't write reviews, but was negatively inspired enough to write one for this item.

I impulse purchased this pencil at Staples the other day to use with a moleskine hardcover diary/planner that I've been using so far this year with honestly no thought at all as it is moleskine brand. I have tried it out for 2 days now and can tell you that I regret the $15 I spent on this item incredibly much.

It is bulky. While it writes well, I can't stand carrying it around in my pocket with the journal. The only positive is the rectanglular shape doesn't roll, but usually pencils with a clip don't role anyway, instead it just gets caught on things in your pocket or bag.

There is no eraser. For me, the whole point of using a pencil over a pen is so that you can erase and I refuse to carry around an eraser in my pocket in addition to it.

It doesn't hold much lead, while it's bulky and rectangular, the lead cylinder is super small (think pen ink cylinder size).

The clip is is already damaging my moleskin notebook cover where it clips on, maybe that is because I have a page-a-day 12 month year notebook that has a lot of pages so I would guess the cover is thicker than a smaller size moleskine?

This item is not going to work for me at all. I cannot endorse it's use to anyone in my imagination, but I'm sure there are some out there that like how it looks.",2.0
"The mechanism last two minutes, it really needs a better quality...",2.0
"It's a cool concept for a pencil to clip right to your notebook, and for that they get one extra star for it. However the design and manufacturing of the pencil is poor. Its click mechanism is not sturdy, I could not get the tip to retract back into the pencil, there is no eraser (I would buy moleskine a specialty erasers for this pencil if the sold them), the clip needs additional give to it (It ripped a part of my moleskine notebook last night), and the edges are sharp and hurt when you write with it (I have relatively larger hands).",2.0
"Very disappointed. First of all - no eraser. Really? Second,  the clip is too short, leaves too mucn sticking out of the top of my planner. Last,  it is flat but not much thinner than other mechanical pencils. I wish I had not wasted money on it and the matching pen.",2.0
"I LOVE my Moleskine notebook.  I write in in exclusively with pencil.  So when I found this, you can imagine how I was very excited.  I do love how it clips to the notebook. It's profile is small and it just looks like it ""belongs"" there.  With that said, it's pretty cheesy as far as mechanical pencils go.  It feels of poor quality.  0.7mm just seems huge for lead IMHO.  There is no built in eraser.  The lead that comes with it seems to be very soft.  It actually makes an irritating sound when I write with it.  Other than the form factor and how it meshes with a Moleskine notebook, I can't recommend this.  My go-to mechanical pencil is a Uni-ball Kuru Toga.

"I bought some Moleskines, but for four of these I could have bought a Poulet de Bresse. In retrospect, I'd rather have the chicken. Then I read in the Guardian that ""Hemingway and Chatwin never actually used a Moleskine. The Italian publisher Modo & Modo created the brand in 1997, so its ""heritage"" - the website also mentions Picasso and Van Gogh - is more myth than fact."" Chagrined, I bought a similar notebook (black, ribbon page marker, elastic strap) at Walmart for $3.97. So I can buy 2 1/4 unbranded notebooks, 192 pages (call them ChineSkines) for the price of one Moleskine. But my knock-off is made in China, you argue? So is the vaunted Moleskine. If Hemingway were still kicking, he'd probably be stocking up at Walmart.

But if Wally World is too dclass for you, or you're simply Anti-Walmart, go over to Barnes & Noble and pick up a Piccadilly. The Piccadilly equivalent (acid-free paper, soy-based inks) is as cheap as $3.08 (blue) and as expensive as $5.99 (red). These not only have the ribbon page marker and elastic strap but even include the much ballyhooed pocket in the back. Either way, you're way ahead, sans the dubious Hemingway/Matisse/Picasso hyperbole and attendant fetishization.

However, I was very disappointed to discover upon starting to use it that with a fountain pen, the paper soaks up too much ink, and feathers and bleeds right through.

I'm using Diamine ink (a good quality ink which generally works fine on normal paper) and a pen with medium flow with a medium nib. It should not be bleeding through the page. This doesn't happen on normal paper, and really this is what I'd expect from a very cheap notebook using low quality paper.

Disappointed.",2.0
"The notebook is huge, and has a sleek look. When it first arrived the front cover was a little bit off, but over some time it started to bend even more, now the front cover is actually curved and the book doesn't lay flat. Still an effective notebook, but the design doesn't look to great.",2.0
"There were a couple oddities with this that I've not experienced with Moleskine before. First off, there were two small nicks in the book's cover, despite it being wrapped in plastic. They were small enough to overlook. Secondly, the back pouch didn't have the individual serial number it was supposed to have -- it did however have the little booklet explaining there should be a serial number, and that book had an odd purple sticker on a backing inserted in it. Third, the outside of the book seems a little greasy/slippery and the pages seemed slightly damp. Lastly, and this is the big thing, the paper of the book smelled like cat poop. I couldn't figure out what the bad smell was, and finally realized it smelled exactly like cat poop. My wife also smelled and confirmed the scent. I have no idea why or how (again it was wrapped in plastic), but the smell was stronger in the pouch in the back. I opened a couple tea bags and put the book and tea bags back in the box and sealed it up, and my hope is that the unpleasant smell goes away.",2.0
I would say the paper is too thin to draw on but it's too thin for anything. If you filled it with writing you'd see the page on the back and behind it right through the paper.

When using a pen the backside of a page is not very useful, so even if the thinner paper allows for more pages, the number of useable pages might not be much different.

"I have consumed more than half a dozen of these Moleskine pocket hardcover notebooks over the past few years.  Overall I'm quite disappointed in their long-term performance, especially for the price and all the marketing hype.  I guess that's what these come down to - pure hype.  They tout names of famous writers like Hemingway and Chatwin almost as if they actually used their products.  I know for a fact that Ernest Hemingway died before the Moleskine Srl *brand* of notebooks came into being.  Sure, the old writers used to use ""moleskine"" or leather-bound notebooks, but they were handmade and undoubtedly of better quality.  These aren't even leather bound; they are bound with some kind of plastic simulated leather.

The paper is of decent quality, but bleeds through pretty easily and frays at the edges.

But the most irritating thing about the Moleskine Srl notebooks is the fact that the binding is as fragile as eggshells.  Every single one of the notebooks I've been through has required reinforcement by tape and/or glue before 1/3 of the pages had been written on.  They just cannot handle day-to-day repetitive use.  The threads come apart, the pages work loose from the threads, and the faux leather binding cracks at the ""hinge"" area.  Eventually the strip of paper in the spine that's holding together the mini booklets of paper inside eventually rips and the binding just falls apart from within.

I suppose the only reason I've used so many of them was because I just wanted to a good notebook and they sure *seem* like they'd be good when you pick one up in the store.  Like Mulder on the X-Files, I really wanted to believe in Moleskine.  And I wanted to give the product an honest chance before giving up on it.  But now I'm convinced they are not worthy of my good notes.  Maybe I'll use the ones I still have for mundane stuff like shopping lists or something.  They COULD be a good notebook if Moleskine could just build a durable binding.

For now, for my ""good notes"" that are worth keeping, I'm switching over to the Leuchtturm 1917 pocket notebooks.  I'll go through a few of those and then write a review on them.  So far, they seem much more promising even though the Leuchtturms have more of a ""perfect"" type binding and the pages do not lay flat like on the Moleskine.  I can live with that, though.",2.0
"I have consumed more than half a dozen of these Moleskine pocket hardcover notebooks over the past few years.  Overall I'm quite disappointed in their long-term performance, especially for the price and all the marketing hype.  I guess that's what these come down to - pure hype.  They tout names of famous writers like Hemingway and Chatwin almost as if they actually used their products.  I know for a fact that Ernest Hemingway died before the Moleskine Srl *brand* of notebooks came into being.  Sure, the old writers used to use ""moleskine"" or leather-bound notebooks, but they were handmade and undoubtedly of better quality.  These aren't even leather bound; they are bound with some kind of plastic simulated leather.

Syncing with evernote doesn't work as nicely as advertised. You can take a snapshop of any notebook page and it will work just as well. The cropping and stuff is far fro perfect and the workflow is tedious. Tagging is so-so. Might as well get a regular Moleskine and tag in Evernote.,2.0
"Well made book that has well designed pages for homebrewing and sampling, just not enough of them. There's sections like ""breweries"" and ""recipes"" that I know I will never use and will go to waste. Then there a huge blank section at the end that can be labeled as different sections, but the pages are just lined. Stylish book and a great idea, but just falls flat.",2.0
"I have read and heard about Moleskine for years. This being my first one, I'm still not sure what is special about them. I know of plenty of other note pads that I like much better.

I will not buy again.",2.0
"great product in appearance and functionality. However, I have opened it twice and pages are already falling out from the middle almost as if they were not glued in correctly",2.0
"I do not understand all the hype about Moleskine.  Is it just because of their history?  Well maybe they used to be really good, but mine has very smooth paper that doesn't soak up the ink very well, so if I don't let it dry for a while (maybe 20 seconds) before closing the cover or fliping the page, it will smear on the opposite page. This is not anywhere near the high quality I was led to believe I'd be getting.  And it is not the ink I am using either.  I use the same pens on a host of other journals and notebooks and only one is as bad as this (odly enough, it is a Moleskine knockoff from Target, but at least it has a real leather cover).  No it is just cheap paper with no 'teeth'.  Still I like the size, it is a perfect size for what I am using it for and the hard cover makes it easier to write in, so I will continue to use it,  but I won't be buying any more of their journals.  I actually bought one of the folios before I'd realized the deficiencies with this one, but I will be returning it (in addition the folio has the same very tight line spacing which is ok for the little book, but not so much for a large desk book).  In any case, there are a ton of superior quality journals out there, just go to Barnes and Noble, and almost everything on the journals rack is superior to Moleskine, And much of it is comperable in price.  For one of the nicest journals I have ever used, I would highly recomend the Gallery Leather (from Maine USA) travel journal.  It is super nice quality, nubuck leather soft bound (thin cover which is nice and plyable) sits flat, and the paper is very nice and with just the right tooth for writing.  It is far superior to the Moleskine and at the same list price (though the G.L. journals rarely if ever go on sale, but that is because they are allready reasonably priced for the quality).  The only thing I am aware of by Moleskine that is actually pretty good is the sketch books.  They have thicker paper and a bigger tooth.  Other wise, I would recomend just about anything over a moleskine, given the high cost to quality ratio.",2.0
"Photographing it and passing it to Evernotes it's very easy
I only wish it had more pages (I like to make a lot of notes)
Don't expect this to be a special notebook, it's just easy to photograph and convert to a digital note, that's it",2.0
"Like other reviewers, I had the same disappointment on receiving my notebook.  I wish I had waited for reviews.

I was expecting more 'magic' and integration -- something special about this notebook, but found none other than the included 3mo subscription code.  I thought maybe my (Android) app wasn't set up correctly, but no.. it's just pictures of paper, like any other.  No automatic alignment, no grid removal, nothing really.  Apparently the stickers are only for iOS?

Fits well in a back pocket, very nice cover, and good quality paper.  It's a nice notebook, but I imagine $20 buys other nice notebooks too.

The pages are quite small, so I find I write close to the binding.  Then you have the challenge of holding it fully open while taking an awkward one-handed picture with Evernote's page camera.  Orientation, finger obfuscation, and focus are all the same as any cheap notebook.

I'd love to see something more like Livescribe, where Evernote has special orientation marks (angle correction) or selection boxes on each page.  A lay-flat binding would be nice for something you're expected to photograph.

If you're not already a subscriber, the 3mo trial is probably the biggest incentive to buy this over another notebook.  Sure feels like a great opportunity missed, though -- Evernote and Moleskin.  Could have been more.",2.0
"If you are using a ballpoint pen (carbon ink) you can for a large part ignore this review.  On the other hand if you are a fountain pen (or a rollerball/gel pen) user, you might want to stay away from Moleskine notebooks.  The paper is untreated meaning that the ink will feather badly and will show through to the opposite side, leaving the flip side of the page unusable. If you are using a liquid based ink this is not the note book for you.  However if you use a micro point (.3 mm) rollerball or a fine or extra fine fountain pen you might experience some feathering but should be fine for the most part.  If you have been using Moleskine notebook prior to the 1990s, these notebooks do not use the same premium French paper that you might be expecting - go with Triomphe, Clairefontaine, Rhodia, G. Lalo, or Verge de France.  The cheap Mead paper, while lighter (16gsm vs 20 gsm) fares better than Moleskine paper in testing performed by persons on the internet, this has also been my own experience.

As long as the priced in the $10 - 12 range, I would say go for it if you are a ballpoint or pencil user who just needs a notebook - this will serve you well.  However, outside this range, consider the Rhodia notebook which can be found and range from the $14 on up - you get better quality treated paper.

While the Moleskine are considered premium paper back prior to the 1990 and quite sought after, the current 'squatters' on the name brand have nothing to do with the company of the past.  Moleskine used premium French paper when it was a French company prior to 1990.  The squatters are Italians who use cheap Chinese manufactured paper instead.",2.0
"I hopped on the hype train and got myself a moleskin notebook. It looks beautiful and is aesthetically exciting. And of course you buy it shrink wrapped so I couldn't open it up.

But this journal really has poor paper. It's like getting into a corvette and learning it has honda civic engine. Sure, it works...cool. But it's not good enough. And I can't use a journal that bleeds through to the next page even with a gentle ball point pen. It hurts my soul because I'm a weirdo like that. It's good paper quality or get out.

I can't recommend this to anyone who enjoys not having everything bleed into the next page.",2.0

"I was pretty naive in thinking that this would be a magical product that would digitize my notes to Evernote, perhaps like the LiveScribe SmartPen.  However, it is literally just a regular Moleskine notebook (which I am a fan of and they are admittedly the best quality notebooks out there).  The digitization occurs when you take a picture of the pages with the Evernote App.  That's all.  I can take a picture of ANY notebook, even one that is 5 cents at Walmart.  I had hoped that the App might have a special algorithm so it can detect the edges of the notebook perfectly, with perhaps some little markers printed on the corners of the notebook to help guide the camera, but it does no such thing.  Granted, the Evernote service will allow you to search handwritten notes taken this way, but it could do this already before this notebook, and with any piece of paper you like.

The only good thing about this notebook is if you're a fan of Evernote and you want to show off such with a physical notebook.

Not a bad product, certainly, but not an innovative or revolutionary one.

Pro:  Beautiful details on the cover and high-quality construction of the pages, the cover, the elastic, and everything.  Comes with a code for Evernote Premium for 3 months, and comes with cute stickers. Green trim is attractive.

Con:  Expensive for a notebook, falls short of promise of bridging paper and digital, seems just a bit lazy for a partnership between two companies I adore.  Unclear on how to make stickers useful in tagging.",2.0
"I was really looking forward to using this. In fact, I waited for nearly a month for it to arrive. However there was no 3 month Evernote Premium code in the book. I may as well have ordered my usual Moleskine for half the price.

It's equally frustrating that Amazon is the seller, but doesn't allow me to communicate with them since the item was delivered today.

Two stars for the Moleskin because they make a decent product, but I am very disappointed.",2.0
"I splurged on this pen with a gift card I had to use up. It is a heavy pen with ink similar to a Pilot G2 or other gel pens.

It attaches easily to either a Moleskine notebook or the leather Franklin Covey binder I use.

The pen has an attractive design, though I'm noticing the finish on the cap's clip is fading from attaching/removing from my notebook.

The ink ran dry after three weeks, faster than any pen I've used before. Before it ran dry, the ink did not flow smoothly; it tended to skip the occasional pen stroke. The official Moleskine ink cartridges are difficult to find locally.

I found that Parker ""Quink flow"" medium ballpoint ink cartridges are the exact same size and shape as Moleskine ink cartridges. I bought a couple of these at Staples. So far, the Parker ink cartridge flows more smoothly and consistently than the Moleskine cartridge it replaced.

When using the pen, the cap does not click into place on the top of the pen: It simply ""sits"" there loosely. If I try to write with the cap on the top of the pen, it wobbles around, plus it makes the pen very unbalanced and uncomfortable to use. You're better off leaving the cap attached to the notebook you're using, when you're writing.

For such an expensive pen, I was surprised at the ink's limited life span and the poorly designed cap that doesn't click in place.

It sure looks nice, though. And the feel of a solid metal pen is unique. However, the shortcomings are disappointing coming from a company whose products I have used and admired for years.",2.0
"I bought this to take with me to jot notes, addresses, etc as it is pocket sized. I have an old Leeds notebook, leather binding, that just cannot hold anymore writing. I purchased this as a substitute. I have the calendar and like it. The binding on this is not very durable. I typically keep ithis in my briefcase and I am finding that the top and bottom of the spine has torn and required scotch tape on both ends to repair. It is a disappointment as I like the design and the paper but the durability is severely lacking. I will try not to ever buy another paper cover notebook again.",2.0
"Warning for fountain pen users: Expect to experience bad ""bleed through"" on the reverse side of sheets of paper bound into this product.

I have used Moleskines for years. I love the feel of paper and take note extensively.  I used an iPad for a while but went back to my moleskine  I will order more.

I hope they have not compromised their manufacturing.,2.0

"Evernote is a wonderful company and I use it almost everyday on my cellphone, tablet and laptop. The 3 free months of the premium version makes this notebook one fo the most inexpensive in the entire Moleskine line. However the problem that I have with this and all other hard cover moleskine notebooks is that the quality is not good at all. The paper has detached from the backing on every single one that I've had. Moleskine does a good job marketing and has a cult following but it hasn't stood the test of time. The softcover notebooks by moleskine are great but there is no evernote version in softcover. So at the writing of this review it's just under $21 dollars, if you factor in the 3 free months of Evernote premium that comes with it that would take the price down to $6. If you're willing to take the chance it's not a bad deal but with the possibility of it falling apart half way through it's life cycle I've personally decided to go with the Leuchtturm 1917 Notebook instead. It's much higher quality, has index pages, archival stickers and heavier paper that is string bound rather than glued in.",2.0
"I bought these notebooks based off of the reviews that I saw on here, and I must say, there is something that I never read anywhere about these notebooks. They are very small. There are only a handful of pages per notebook (which I guess I was supposed to assume from the awesome price). Also, I was rather disappointed at how easy it is to ruin the covers of the books. The moleskin that they so very proudly tout can be stained by the oil on your hands. Heaven forbid that you have something else on your hands before handling them. I feel this should have been made aware to the customers in the description, and I won't be buying any more of these.",2.0

"This is the first Moleskin notebook I've purchased. Frankly I bought it because Staples had it mismarked so with the 3 months of Evernote Premium it came out to a screaming deal. I thought these were supposed to be premium books.  Honestly I don't see it. The paper is thin, and I get ink bleed through from my Mont Blanc rollerball.

Moleskin seems to have done a great marketing job, but that's about it.  Unless you're a EV premium user and get a good deal on the book, there's no way it's worth the price they put on it.  There's no reason to buy this over a generic office supply store book.",2.0

I was hoping for a lot more quality out of a notebook this expensive.",2.0

I just bought two notepads and the post it notes. After upgrading to premium and using all three items I realized that you do not need an evernote notepad to work. All it does is take a picture of the page and attaches it to the note in evernote. You cannot edit your note take as a picture you can only doodle on top of it. It's really just a marketing route by Evernote to buy there notepads and post its. The large pads are also not so large. They will not fit into a legal portfolio.,2.0
"I was so excited about getting my first Moleskine. The exterior is great: sturdy, well-bound, and I love the bookmark and pockets. I'm a writer, so I constantly have a book with me to jot down ideas and quotes. However, I also love using ink, which seems to be a bit of an issue. Every pen I've used with this notebook bleeds through - the pages are far too thin. Whether you're using a fountain pen or cheap ballpoint, the ink will bleed through the pages. I don't want to waste my money, so I'll use up the book, but I won't be purchasing another.",2.0

Bought this pen to match with my Moleskine notebook. From the picture the pen seemed to have a low profile design which it does not. The pen is not worth the money. I would suggest if you are considering purchasing this pen to consider going to Staples and purchasing an adhesive pen loop for notebooks for $1.99 and using any pen or pencil you want.,2.0

"Speaking on the quality, I don't think they make them like they used to when I first started buying them. I was just checking mine over to see how it's held up after using about half of it, and was surprised to find that the back cover has separated about three-fourths the way from the binding. This was a notebook I received in replacement of another similar problem I had. Usually the corners of the cover along the spine get a little worn/torn but holds up nicely. My last experience with Moleskine was pleasant, so hopefully they can get this one fixed as well. It's just a shame they keep making them cheaper and cheaper. The cover has changed, the paper and lines have changed and the quality has changed.

I've used a couple of other good Moleskine alternatives purchased at Meijer, Office Depot, and a bookstore a while back. I may have to look into these again, especially if a $7 notebook holds up better than the Moleskine.",2.0
"I purchased these pens several times from Staples and they have become my favorite pens.  I'm very selective about the pens I purchase.  I like very fine pens that don't skip and don't leave ""blobs"" of ink on your paper. It took me years to finally find a pen that I LOVED.  Problem is they are expensive and they run out of ink quickly as I use them every day at my office job.  I tried these on the Amazon site, same pens, same packaging, except that you could tell the packaging was old by the brownish tinge of one of the three I ordered.  I opened it first and it would not write at all no matter how I tried.  Left it hanging upside down for a few days, but still could not get it to write even a small line on a piece of paper.  The other two I am still using, but one of them skips every once in a while.  The third writes beautifully as all the other ones I purchased in the past.  So sorry I can't say I will order from here again.  Not sending back too much trouble for one pen.  I do LOVE the moleskin pens and I will use them as long as I can find them.",2.0
"I had tried the Moleskine pen for a few brief seconds in the store, but I now know that I am NOT a fan of square pens. The angle is awkward and requires developing a new callous. Additionally I am not overall very satisfied with the ink, it tends to stop working at random intervals (not ideal during client meetings).

The only positive of this pen is that the ink does not bleed through the pages of my Moleskine notebooks.",2.0
Expensive for a pen that writes so poorly especially in a Moleskine notebook. I got a couple on clearance thank goodness. I would be livid if I paid full price.,2.0
"Poor product and overpriced. I bought the pen as a companion for my moleskin.

The only bright side is that the pen has a flat edge which ostensibly would mesh well with the notebook, not rolling, etc.

The downside is that the pen was unreliable. Started and stopped, then suddenly was out of ink entirely without even fading. Did it dry out? Who knows.

The housing of the pen is cheap plastic and the end of the pen slides around, begging to be played with, which will lead to it being unscrewed.

Once it dried up , I was penless during the day which was a hassle. The stationary store I visited, in order to replace it quickly, told me that they had had nothing but complaints about the pen since they'd received it. Go figure.

I bought a metal Zebra pen from Amazon and have been far happier.",2.0
"pros: Gel and tip are high quality.
cons: cap easily loosens from body, tip moves sideways while writing.",2.0
"This pen has only one good thing about it: It fits perfectly on the Moleskine notebook. Besides that I would not buy it. To expensive for what it offers. After 2 weeks of use it started to fade, then two days letter ink flow got back to normal to just to start fade / not flow again a few days later.

If this pen would work fine, I would buy a box. But until they improve this I would not buy it.",2.0
"I love Moleskine products. I have always associated Moleskine products with being high quality. That is why I couldn't wait to get my hands on this pen for my Evernote Moleskine notebook. I like to carry the notebook around literally everywhere I go, so I needed a writing tool that could come with me without getting lost (like all my previous pens).

Likes: This one conveniently clips to the Moleskine notebooks like a married couple. In fact, the cap is the highest quality aspect of this pen; nice sturdy and hefty feel to it with a smooth rubbery texture. I also like the shape of the pen, although it will take some time for most to get acquired to it.

Dislikes: The rest of the pen (the actual writing piece) feels super cheap. They could have used a much sturdier plastic, but instead it feels cheap, nimble and as if it could break apart very easily. First thing I did was try to write to see how impressive it was..The ink skips very frequently, the .5mm tip feels sharp and grainy on the paper (sometimes ripping holes in the paper). I opened the pen up to take out the ink cartridge, but it was stuck since it was inserted at a slant. I had to use a paper clip to get the ink out of the plastic pen. The stock cartridge is also super cheap (not sure about the ones they sell on their site).

Conclusion: I reallllly had high hopes for this pen. It could have easily impressed me (the cap is awesome!) but the actual pen is rather terrible in my honest opinion. I hope Moleskine decides to redesign or refresh their line of pens. It seems to be their primary product weakness. I still love Moleskine products, so I will be checking back for updates on their pen line.",2.0

Instead, write in your Moleskine with a Papermate Flair (http://www.amazon.com/Papermate-Point-Guard-Porous-Medium/dp/B0006VO194/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1394121715&sr=8-3&keywords=papermate+flair) - I use black but they come in many colors for those who need that.",2.0
"I really wanted to like this pen... I really did. But in the end I'm just glad I ended up getting it as a gift because if I had paid almost $14 for this pen I would feel pretty ripped off. First of all, the design... WHO in the HELL decided that a flat and wide rectangular pen body was a good idea? It's the same shape as a carpenter's pencil-- you know, the utensils that AREN'T meant for writing? I find it pretty uncomfortable and it hinders my writing as a whole... I actually like seeing my own handwriting and this pen makes my penmanship look like I was on crack when I was writing... not to mention all of the constant dry ink patches that I've had to scribble all over my notebook to fix. And after the margins of my page look like garbage from all that scribbling, oh, it still won't write. In fact the first entry in my new notebook I actually noted how crappy my pen was. When I use it, many of my words and letters have lines and scribbles all over them from me going over the same letter over and over again trying to coax my pen to write... ugh! When the ink does actually decide that it wants to write, it's a nice experience; the ink is smooth and bold and despite what others have said, I've noticed only minimal smudging, if at all. But I still can't give this pen a remotely good review because half the time spent in my journal is used furiously scribbling and repeatedly going over letters to try and get some ink out. When I do have a spell of smooth, uninterrupted writing, my fingers get sore from having to accommodate such an unusual and uncomfortable pen shape. Sometimes it even flips around between my fingers because I can't find a place to hold it that feels comfortable. I'll say it again: whoever thought of the ""carpenter"" style pen for WRITING is seriously an idiot. Derp! Also, the clip at the top is alright but doesn't do much to keep the pen from eventually sliding off the side. This pen is not worth the money... there are pens with much better (& sensible) designs and with similar gelly ink that write 1000% better than this one. Go out and buy those; you'll get 5-10 decent pens that can write worth a damn for the same price, instead of one that can't manage a single sentence without going dry.",2.0

I just wish they had executed it with better materials. I wouldn't recommend this pen unless you're really dying for this design. Not that this pen is really expensive, but when considering how cheaply its made, it seems that way. It writes okay. Its kind of a watery gel feeling. Good but not great.",2.0
"This pen is a good match for those of you who like to have something clipped to your Moleskine notebook.  However, please be aware that the ink in the refill is gummy and sticky.  I found it to be unacceptable and switched the refill out for a standard Parker-type refill.  Thus, I now have a good pen with a good refill for my Moleskine notebook.",2.0
"While the cover is solid, and I don't have issues with the paper bleeding ink, this notebook does not stand up to daily use. I wrote 15 pages worth, and 9 of the 15 pages ripped themselves out in the process of writing.  The stitching seems to be much weaker than in the past, or poor quality? And no, I didn't crack it flat open, stressing the binding, either. Anyways, not buying moleskine ever again.",2.0
While functionality is the same as the other Moleskine books - this doesn't quite carry the same class as the other books (the Hobbit does make it look quite cheap - and probably hence the discount).,2.0
It was what I was looking for but is was overprice. I can get it cheaper and most places that sell it,2.0
I thought I'd try quality for a lasting reference of detailed material that I needed to access frequently but this notebook couldn't stand up to daily use and fell apart long before I even filled half of it up.  Binding just disintegrated and the pages started to tear out with little wear.,2.0
"Too skinny, no pocket. My fault, I didn't order the right one. There are like a million to choose from. :)",2.0
The pages are to thin. When using a roller ball pen you can see the writing on the back side and sometimes the ink bleeds through. Other than that the notebook was as described. I just expected something better from a Moleskine product.,2.0
"I use these notebooks as logbooks to keep records of work that I do as an amateur horologist.  I use vintage fountain pens to keep my records.  While Moleskine notebooks were never great for writing with a fountain pen, the latest batch seems to be noticeably worse than in the past.  I now have to choose ink and nib size very carefully in order to avoid serious bleed through on the pages.  I'm actively looking for notebooks of the same size and construction but with paper better suited to record keeping with pen and ink, and won't be using Moleskine notebooks in future.",2.0
"Too tiny! I didn't realize the size when I purchased - thought it was the one that is one step larger. Bummer! I replaced it, but was disappointed with this purchase. If you are looking for a tiny calendar though, this would probably be perfect.",2.0
"I was excited to get this because I am a fan of the format of the planner. I've always used just the regular ruled moleskine for my work notes and to-dos. However, the pages of this planner are SO thin you cannot write with a dark ink pen, like a gel pen. It becomes impossible to read your notes because the notes from the previous page bleed through to much. Thicker pages next time please.",2.0
"Yeah, Moleskines have a cult following among those of us who journal or otherwise love a good notebook, but that following is largely undeserved.  Moles are overpriced, poor-quality products.  Their paper is thin and cheap (except for some of the specialty books, like the sketchbook), they cost about three times what they should, and really the name is all that you're paying for.  Piccadilly makes an essentially identical product for a much more reasonable price.  Don't waste your money on a Moleskine unless you're one of those trendoid nitwits who has to have the designer label on everything.",2.0
"Love moleskins, but this just an over priced moleskin that really does not add any value.  You can still take photos of your standard moleskin just like this over priced one. Save your money.",2.0

"Moleskines are oft regarded as THE classic premium notebook. The cover is soft, velvety almost, and the pages a pleasing muted ivory color. They come in many different varieties. They have a huge cult following of people, many who are amazing artists, more who just enjoy writing their thoughts or stories down for personal enjoyment. There are websites devoted to modifications and everyday uses for them. In short, when someone cares about what they're writing, they'll often write it in a Moleskine.

So why only two stars?

It has nothing to do with the Amazon's shipping times--which shouldn't be mentioned in product reviews at all--or a need to troll people for liking them so much. If the notebook works for you and you love it, that's awesome. And I used to be one of those people. My Moleskine in filled with story notes, front to back.

But the allure faded when I ventured back into a hobby I'd strayed from several years back, before I'd discovered Moleskines. When I began collecting fountain pens again and amassing huge stockpiles of inks of all different types I discovered these notebooks' Achilles' heel.

But let's review some facts about them first:

- The notebooks are manufactured by a company based in Milan, Italy. They are an Italian company through and through.
- The notebooks are designed in Italy.
- The notebooks have acid-free paper.
- The notebooks are NOT manufactured in Italy, but rather in China (with a small number of notebook models being made in Turkey or Vietnam).
- The quality control of the notebook ""hardware"" (cover, bands, bookmark) is great.
- The quality control of the actual paper is woefully lacking,

And that's where my problem with the notebooks lies.

The paper in these notebooks is thin; prone to severe feathering, show through, and bleed through; and does not provide for much in the way of ink shading.

Does this matter id you're using a ballpoint? Mostly no, though show through is bad with all types of ink. But even though ballpoint ink isn't absorbed into the paper, the pages are so thin that you can see right through them.

Does this matter if you use rollerballs, gels, or--as is the case with my main use--fountain pens? Absolutely.

While the problems vary from ink to ink, feathering and bleed through with these notebooks is atrocious. If you're using anything but the finest nib and the driest ink you won't be able to use the backs of the pages on which you're writing. And if you're a fan of inks that shade heavily, forget about it. The paper is far too absorbent to let any shading happen.

The only inks I haven't had a problem with are very light ballpoint refills (specifically the turquoise Fisher Space Pen refills). They're light enough to not show through, and because they're ballpoints the ink isn't absorbed into the paper.

If you want some actual quality European paper in almost the exact same notebook form (and I mean almost exactly the same), get a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rhodia-Orange-Webnotebook-5-5x8-25-Lined/dp/B0029FE1J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rhodia Orange Webnotebook 5.5x8.25 Lined</a>. Rhodia paper is some of the best in the world (they're owned by Clairefontaine, whose paper is to die for). With the Rhodia paper you will not experience bleed through. You will not experience show through. You will be able to see the inks' shading characteristics. And even the wettest blob of an inky line you can lay down will not feather. Yes, the Webnotebooks are twice the price, but they are one hundred percent absolutely worth it if what you're after is actual quality, not a fad.

However, if you write with ballpoints or pencil and not with anything that lays down a wet line, the Moleskines won't do you wrong.",2.0
Paper is too ridiculously thin.,2.0
Does not light pages adequately.  Also requires constant relocation but that's not a problem as it doesn't stay put in any one place very well. Not up to standard of my experience with other Moleskine products and I have returned it.,2.0
"Really, what you're mostly paying for is the 3 months of premium Evernote. The product itself is fine, but the programmable stickers don't really work and the results of the page snapshots aren't that great. Just use the free app with any old notebook - it should work. It's cool when it works to the extent that it does, but not necessarily worth the money. This is literally the most I've ever spent on a notebook. I've bought hardcover sketch folios for slightly less (and those are of a larger size). I heard about this on Popular Science and I really had high hopes for this one.",2.0
Every pen I tried bled through completely. I ended up getting rid of it and buying a new journal for my bullet journal. I would suggest buying a journal with 100+ GSM paper weight.,2.0
"I expected an academic planner, and this did not meet my expectations. I returned this item 2 minutes after opening it.",2.0
"These notebooks are really popular for some reason and I do not understand it.  The paper quality is very inconsistent and they are expensive for the quality.  I have had two of these things and one had relatively smooth paper and one had horrible paper.  If you write with a fountain pen this paper definitely is not for you.  The ink with bleed and feather.

If you want a nice notebook look into Rhodia and Clairefontaine...their paper quality is consistent and just about the highest quality writing paper you can find.",2.0
This is a pretty poor quality product.  The pages are too thin and the over quality is very poor.  Feels and looks cheap.,2.0
Soft binding is impractical.,2.0
"When I purchased the notebook I was expecting a regular sized notebook, one a bit smaller than a five star 1 subject notebook.  Instead it is rather small and not worth the 12$ I paid for it.  The bindings were damaged on the notebook (pressed in and wrinkled).  The paper is rather good quality and the overall look of it is rather professional.

All and all I'd suggest going to staples and buying a nice notebook there.  That way you can feel the paper and see the overall quality of the notebook.",2.0
"There's a lot of good to be said about the notebook, and Moleskine deserve credit for reviving this design which had nearly disappeared.  The hard cover. . . the elastic band. . .  the cloth bookmark. . .  the ivory paper. . .  the rounded corners. . .  It's all good.  I might quibble that the ruled lines are spaced a bit narrowly for my handwriting.  It's good with a EF nib pen, and it fits a few more lines on each page, but it's a wee bit cramped compared with my normal handwriting.

What really ruins it for me is the paper quality.  I've heard it varies from one batch to the next, and it sure seems like I got one of the bad ones.  I found many combinations of fountain pens and ink are prone to ugly feathering and bleeding in it.  With many of them it's impractical to write on both sides of the sheet, which basically cuts the notebook in half from what it should be.  TO BE FAIR, I found I could tame it by choosing the right ink (Noodlers Black) and using a not-too-wet fountain pen.  Indeed, I would be willing to take this extra effort to adapt to this notebook's quirks if there were no better alternatives out there.

Recently, though, other companies such as Quo Vadis and Rhodia have come up with their own moleskine-style notebooks featuring high-quality paper.  They cost a bit more, but I figure this type of notebook is a premium product to begin with.  In the future I'll give Moleskine a miss and spend a little more for a better notebook.  (Being able to write with confidence on both sides of the page means I could actually come out ahead on cost too.)",2.0
"The pages are not bonded correctly and they are all bent, which does not make it easy to write on.  If the pages were bonded correctly I would probably love it, but I seem to have received a defect.",2.0
"Every pen I have bleeds through :( The size is ok for what I need, but I really wish paper quality was better. Sorry Moleskine, not buying your product again!",2.0
"This is not a bad pocket journal, and it has very good paper quality, suitable for use with good fountain pens.  However, it is marketed as doing something very specific with Evernote: allowing handwriting recognition and seamless integration of notes written in this product with other device-generated notes.  In this, it is little better than any other small notebook costing a quarter as much.  Being a small, tightly bound book, the pages do not lay flat for photographing with the device's camera, which is the means of importing into Evernote.  You must use some weight or other method for getting in-focus pictures of your pages.  This interferes with the auto-cropping and distortion-correcting function in Evernote.  Furthermore, I have been unable to detect any enhanced recognition ability referable to the use of this notebook.  The little tag stickers only work most, but not all of the time, and the page-defining ribbon does not lay flat or straight either.
Evernote's handwriting OCR is fair to middling, and the important fact here is that it is no better with this expensive little notebook than it is with a $2.50 Clairfontaine pocket notebook of the same size with equally good paper.  Evernote should modify its software to recognize the little Tag stickers wherever they are applied, and just sell them by themselves.  I would not buy another of these pocket notebooks.",2.0
"It works as described. However, I was hoping it would transpose the handwritten text to actual text that can be copied and pasted to other things. The text you take pics of becomes searchable in evernote and gets tagged automatically with the tags. The only advantages I could see over just taking a pic of whatever normally from a regular notepad.",2.0
Very cute but soft cover is a problem... I thought this would make it more light-weight but it's really difficult to write in - get the hard cover instead.,2.0

I wanted something nicer than the cheap Mead graph-lined notebook I had been using, and this is pretty much the gold standard if you look at bullet journal recommendations.

My gel pens bleed through every page, and even worse, the ink takes forever to dry on the paper so everything is smeared and ugly. My journal now looks like crap. I'll be going back to my $4 Mead, I just can't believe I wasted $20 on what will essentially turn into scrap paper.",2.0

"I'll start by saying I love love love Moleskine products. I have owned many of their journals over the years and have been pleased with every one. I was so enamored by the color of this one that I was willing to order it and wait (it was on backorder) for several weeks before receiving it in the mail. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment when it arrived. It feels, and looks cheap. The cover feels like it's constructed of a material that is wildly inferior to other Moleskine journals I've used, frankly, it's terrible. Two stars out of fairness because the color is as pictured and the quality of the paper is up to the usual Moleskine standard. But the cover is a deal breaker, I won't be buying this particular iteration of the Moleskine journal again.",2.0
Not as sturdy as I had hoped they would be. They bend very easily which if you're not very organized like me (which is the reason I got these so I could write everything down) then it's easy to accidentally bend them in a backpack as I did.,2.0

"I have heard bullet journal people everywhere rave about this particular notebook, so I ordered it. I have to say that I am not impressed.
The book itself seems to be of good quality, with the soft, classic moleskin cover. Yet when I tested pens on a page towards the back, every single one bled through. And I don't mean just marks from pressing into the page...I mean ink stains on the following pages so dark that the page is unusable. I was so excited to get this journal, and I had heard that the pages were somewhat bleed-resistant, but sadly that is not the case.",2.0
The ink bleeds through to the other side. I was hoping for better quality paper.,2.0

"I used to be a die-hard fan of the Moleskine diary, but I haven't purchased anything other than a package of cahiers since I started bullet journaling. This was my first Moleskine classic in a handful of years, and I think they must have changed something. The paper has a slight shine to it, and it takes a moment for anything other than a ballpoint pen to soak into the paper, which means you get a ton of streaks and splotchy ink marks if you aren't extremely careful. I can't imagine how bad it would be for lefties.

There isn't a ton of feathering, but I can see the ghosting from two pages back using an InkJoy Gel pen, which seems pretty ridiculous. Forget using a Tombow brush pen or a Crayola marker in this thing. The color is a sort of nauseating pink, instead of the more orchid-y purple depicted on the item page.

I saw the bad reviews and decided to buy this anyway, so it's on me. I'm definitely disappointed, but it'll have to do for now.",2.0
"I did not realize how small this book would be. a little dissapointed, but it is all my mistake.",2.0
Pages are EXTREMELY thin. The writing shows through to the next page no matter which pen I use. I am very disappointed and I expected better from a Moleskin product.,2.0
"I the the notebook, but the colour shows blue on the site, but it's actually green.  A bit disappointed.",2.0
"Moleskin makes a quality notebook - very sturdy, nice material, good paper, etc. But I was surprised to find that this notebook is set up more like an address book with one page per book review. I think a good book review and notes requires more than just one page. Also, some of the preprinted categories on each page are really unimportant, such as ""Original Language"" and ""First Edition."" The space to write is very limited, especially in the sections labelled ""Notes"" and ""Quotes"" - very, very small spaces to write in what should take a few pages. There are blank pages in the back but there should have been more for each alphabetical listing in the book section.

Again, Moleskin quality is second to none, but this journal was not at all what I expected. Part of the fault lies with me as I didn't look closely at the preview images. Still, not very well designed in my opinion. To do a true book review justice, just get a regular Moleskin and make your own sections using different colored pencils. (This book journal does include some stickers to use in your pages. Cool but stickers are limited.)

I would not recommend this journal as I don't think it is the best layout for book reviews.",2.0
"This is a good quality notebook, just as you would expect from Moleskine. The sections and three ribbon bookmarks are nice. However, the main selling point for me was the promise that I could easily print pages that would fit this notebook exactly, making it easy for me to paste all of my travel notes, reservation information, etc. into the notebook. What a nightmare that has been. The program on the Moleskine website that allows you do that is very difficult to use. Most of my reservation confirmations came via email, and there is no easy way to paste them into the program. I ended up having to take screenshots of different portions of the emails, then pasting them into the program as .jpgs. I eventually figured out that it was much easier to work in Microsoft Word, and simply set the margins to the correct size so the pages would print out the size of the notebook. Even if you want to use the Moleskine program, they have the option to print pages to the size of any of their notebooks - not just this Voyageur notebook, even though it was touted as an extra-special feature of this notebook. I'm sticking with it now, but if I had to do it over, I wouldn't have spent the money on the Voyageur. I would have just gotten a ""regular"" Moleskine.",2.0
Is not much more then any other lined notebook.,2.0
"I'm a big fan of Moleskine journals, and I've never found a book journal yet that's satisfied me. So as soon as I saw this I knew I wanted one. Unfortunately this book doesn't look up to the premise.

The book information pages don't have enough open space for me to structure my own notes, I'd prefer far fewer fill-in-the-blank categories. I only need title, author, date read, and maybe publication year, the other things are unnecessary at best. If I ever cared to note the nationality of the author, original language of the book, or awards it won (in the cases where any of those apply), I could easily do so in a more reasonably sized notes section. Including fields for so many specific (and often rarely-used) categories is a waste of valuable page space.

The alphabetical tabs in the book pages are a terrible feature. I read over 150 books last year, and none of them started with X. I didn't read any X authors, either. I read only one book that began with V, but 25 S books - which is more than the journal could hold. Those small tabs are also not a very sturdy option, several of mine are bent already after less than a week of fairly gentle use. The pages are numbered, so it would have been easy to just let those who need quick access to specific book pages create their own index or table of contents using some of the blank pages. Then everyone would have been free to list their reading by their own preferred method, such as reading date, genre, or subject, rather than making us all deal with alphabetical organization.

I liked the section at the back that lets us create our own tabs, because many book journals are too structured. While the Moleskine falls into that trap on the book detail pages, I'm happy that it lets us create some of our own sections at the end. For example, many journals include pages for book club notes or shop addresses even though I don't need those. With the tabbed sections, people who want those sections can have them, but I'm free to use my nice, blank pages for shopping lists, loan tracking, and drafting reviews longer than the book detail pages allow for.

The three bookmark ribbons are a great feature, but I could do without having book titles that don't really reflect my taste stamped into the cover. The cutesy colored stickers are also unnecessary. If Moleskine creates an updated version with no alphabetical tabs and a freer book page layout, I'd buy at least one copy a year for myself and probably give several as gifts. But the current organization is to limited for me to consider it for long-term use.",2.0
"I'm a big fan of Moleskin products, in general, and so my first impression was ""Where was this when I was working on my PhD a few years ago?"" However, on further examination, I realized the product was lackluster. Here's why:

1. Assumptions. Moleskin's designers assume the user wants to organize what she reads in alphabetical order and predetermines a set amount of pages for each letter. This is useless. Both scholars and general book lovers have favorite authors that will likely fill more than the allotted pages, while other sections go unused. In addition, this ""feature"" eliminates many other ways or organizing your reviews (e.g., year read, year written, genre, etc.).

2. Gimmickry. Rather than provide us with a bunch of silly stickers with symbols and exclamations, how about making the books more flexible by including blank, color-coded stickers that we can self label to organize our books? The provided stickets just ratchet up the cost of production with little value added.

3. Page Layout. Here again Moleskin was heavy-handed in dictating how we should use the product and organize our information. In my opinion it privileges bibliographic information over note taking. If I'm going to haul a book around that's the size of a paperback, I want it to be for notes, not a list I can easily keep on my computer or smart phone. I carry paper for its flexibility. Let it be flexible.

The product isn't all bad, of course. This is Moleskin, so the journal is of very high production quality (e.g., great paper, nice binding, ribbon dividers, etc.). I just wish Moleskin would have scaled back the features by about 80% to make the book more flexible. I'd love the top 1/4 of the page given over to bibliographic data, the remaining 3/4s for notes, and flexible divider tabs that can be attached anywhere in the book with blank stickers for labeling them.",2.0
"This journal looks great -- black cover with authors names and titles on it in a range of language, a fabric covered rubber band to hold it closed, tabs with letters to organize the entries please an index you can create, and tri colored ribbons to mark your place in the journal.  It even includes a bookmarker in case you need one.

I have several journals that I use to review products and services including two movie journals and a wine tasting journal.  I find them useful when I'm trying to decide what to see again or for the first time or when picking out a new bottle versus an old favorite for a meal.  I'm a book reviewer, been one for years before Amazon Vine program, so I review easily 150 books a year.

This journal could not handle even one year of what I review in it's pages.  That is the biggest problem I have with it.

Each letter of the alphabet has entry that includes areas for you to fill in date read, title, author, awards, your impressions and a rating among other information.  However there are only 6 pages per letter.  You have to do decide how to organize the books, by title or by author but really I doubt I'll be reading as many X books as ones that begin with H or C or S for example.  There are many empty pages in the back so the journal could easily have added more pages to either all of lettered sections or to the most commonly used letters.

With half the book unstructured I really feel disappointed by the layout.  The unstructured sections aren't make it less organized and throw the idea of the index out the window.  Do I include more notes on the books in those ""personally tabbed"" or ""blank"" sections?  The structured section is great, I just need more of it and less of these empty pages.

The publisher needs to rethink this design and rework it.  When then do that, it might be a book worth having.  For now, it's only a book you'll need to seriously stop and think ""Is this book worthy of inclusion in this pages?"" or you'll soon run out of room.",2.0
"For me this product really misses the mark.  The book looks like an old fashioned address book with lettered tabs.  For each letter of the alphabet, there is room to review 6 books.  So you may review only six books that start with the letter T and just as many (six) books that start with the letter X -- does that make much sense?  Each page contains an area to list the following information: title, date read, author, nationality, first edition, publisher, year, quotes, original language, awards, notes, opinion and rating.  The sections for quotes and opinion are the largest but still too small for me to really fill in as much as I would like.  There is no way to add pages in any section as this is a bound book.  The book is the size of a standard paperback novel -- so just not large enough to write anything of substance.  If this product were an application for my Blackberry or an iphone, I think I would love it.  I'd have a list with me that would remind me of authors I liked anytime I walked into a book store. I'd have more space and the option to review as many items under each letter of the alphabet as I liked and I could include books that I would like to read or received as recommendations from others.  The quality of the product for the price is fine, but I couldn't recommend it.",2.0
"I want to like this.  I do like the size and the format.  The binding is fine.  I like the color scheme and the tint of the paper.  I even like the included stickers.  However, the paper (obviously a key component) is disappointing.  It's too thin.  Not good for a fountain pen.  Even a black roller ball shows through, significantly, on the other side.  It is usable with a ballpoint or a pencil (although even these show through more than I would prefer).  The paper also seems unusually sensitive to moisture.  An inadvertent smudge of water will wrinkle it up to an unusual degree, possibly because it is so thin.  I'm concerned about the ability of this planner to hold up for the 18 months that it covers.  The paper is just not the quality I expected for the price.  It would be ok if it was a journal, if one was content to just use one side of each page.  This design, however, requires that one be able to write on both sides of a page.  I am using it, with a pencil, but would not purchase it again.",2.0
"I wanted to love this-I wanted to decorate the hell out if it with washi tape, I wanted to color code my entries on this blank slate, and instead I'm sending it back.

I knew it didn't have a bigger size, but ""Extra Large"" is still just ""meh."" If I would have seen this in person, I never would have purchased.",2.0

"The color is nice, and it's sturdy and made well. Though, I am disappointed. I was researching Moleskin journals as people raved about how it can lay flat on the table. That's a big pet peeve of mine, and This doesn't at all. Secondly, I have huge handwriting, and the small lines make my writing look weird. Lastly, the paper is so thin it's hard to utilize both sides of the paper when writing. In closing, it's an overall nice notebook but you can get the same features from a normal notebook for under $5.",2.0
The color is not even kind of as vibrant as it is here. It's more of a muted purple,2.0
"The description says there is a band to hold it closed like other Moleskine products. This is not true. The cover is also a simple piece of paper, not a nice leatherette like other notebooks by the company. Definitely not worth the money. Its' only saving grace is the nice paper quality.",2.0
"Nice design, however the pages are far too thin, to the point of being transparent. Would not recommend.",2.0
"So I bought this after owning a number of Moleskin notebooks.. Not what I expected at all.. The book itself is too thick, the cover doesn't look as nice as in the pictures and the paper quality is too rough - don't use ink...

The box was the main reason i ordered this, and it is absolutely terrible - very cheap just made of paper - its not really a box at all so the description a little misleading..",2.0
The quality of this was surprisingly bad.  The weight of the paper is less and the overall quality worse than the one I bought last year.  Incredibly transparent.  The pages are sewn in unevenly.  The edges of the book not rounded smoothly.  It feels lighter and less substantial.  It makes a cracking noise when I open it.  The cover ever so slightly warped.  This may be my last purchase of a moleskine  and I get them every year.  The planners on the bargain table at Barnes and Noble seemed better quality than this.  I usually keep a moleskine sketchbook and a planner with me daily.  But every new purchase is a poorer version of the last.  Commenters- I'd love recommendations of new books.,2.0
"Disappointing, I should have read the fine print where it says the word ""notebook"". This is NOT the book, the hobbit, it is also questionable whether or not its moleskin, it is cloth, but not what I think of moleskin, which is a fine swede.

"This set really isn't worth the price to me. The books are not very large at all. I could have looked at the dimensions to have seen that, so that's on me, but the books are very thin. Even if you stacked all three together, they're barely enough to equal a normal-sized journal. For writers with large handwriting or those who write a lot, it isn't worth your money. I purchased these as a gift and was disappointed.",2.0

"As everyone seems to love this pad but I really hate it. In all honesty I thought it was all I need so I've ran out of watercolour pads and papers so I only have this solely so I'm trying to use it and trying to like it. It is frustrating and I do not like it. I don't usually even paint with that much water but its absorbency is ridiculously quick. Too quick for me to enjoy this as a painter. Here's a few picks of me trying to like and use this.. worst work I've ever done. I know doesn't look it but the palms and coconuts, I was being super precise and trying to use only droplets of water...... no exaggeration, is the only reason why looks okay but you can still see how in the coconut one, the page is already crinkling up with little amount used. Will never buy this again because I simply do not paint like that. Maybe great product for others as so positive but maybe I had a bad batch lol or I just really suck :p",2.0
"It arrived bent and although I straitened it, it has crinkles in the cover. I'm also surprised that it does not have more cotton in the paper for the price. Maybe leave out the useless back pocket?",2.0
"Pages are really, REALLY thin and flimsy. You will not be able to draw on the back of your pages unless you want to see the drawings from the reverse side through your new work. If you still want this sketchbook, know that you'll need to put a thicker sheet of paper under every page you work on because even medium pressure will make dents on the opposite page, rendering that one (and possibly a couple more below it) useless too. It's only good for light pencil work. If you do a lot of quick pencil sketches on the go, you might like this. But even in that case there are better small sketchbooks out there.

I was required to have these notebooks for an art class, but I will never purchase them again.

Overall, here's how I'd rate this:
for quick pencil sketching: 3 stars
for everything else: 2 stars",2.0
"I did not like this paper for traveling water color. The panoramic style doesn't give many options if you're trying to draw a landscape with tall objects (trees etc)

I also felt like I was painting on a waxy surface because the water didn't really soak In the page. And the color took quite a while to set and it's hard to do watercolor techniques on it.",2.0
"I like the size of the notebook, I like the soft leather feel of the cover. The only problem but is a main problem is no matter what type of pen I use, the ink will bleed through making it so I can't use the other side of the page. This is the worst paper I have ever seen in a Moleskine notebook.",2.0
"I found the paper to be bad in mine:

1. It does not adsorbs my ink (Noddler's Bulletproof Black) nor professional quality watercolors. I understand it's not a watercolor notebook, but I do not get the reason of having thick pages in this case. It virtually repels water/ink, so pages could be safely thinner.

2. It does not have enough teeth for my lead and watercolor pencils.

3. The paper is bleached white but coated with yellow, which is apparent when looking on the edges. I do like off-white paper, but this ""acid"" yellowish coating is rather annoying.

I understand that paper quality can depend on the batch, so maybe this product will work for someone. It did not fill my need though and I need to get a watercolor or plain version.",2.0
Expensive for what they are. Not very substantial in terms of number of pages. I thought they would be lined and was disappointed to see when the order arrived that these were plain. Would not buy again.,2.0
"This notebook is the perfect size, has good high-quality paper, and the cover pocket is very useful. Unfortunately, two weeks in your pocket and it's falling to pieces. Pages are falling out, you're losing important phone contact information. Week three and one cover is gone, the pocket has fallen off the other one.

Switch to the next of the set of three and the same thing happens again.

Do not buy this as a pocket notebook. Shoddy construction.

The Moleskine Volant (sold in sets of two) is much tougher.",2.0
"The pages, as you can see in the attached photo, have delaminated! Not good for a 'watercolor' book. I did a quick wash across the two pages and planed to add more to the sketch, but now I don't even want to use the rest of the book. I've only done very light watercolors with pencils on the first 3 pages. What a waste....",2.0
"The paper is yellow not white as shown in the product pictures! false advertising? The yellow is manila as in manila folder yellow. White is the obvious choice, why not white? Even the front label shows it as white. Whats worse is if you use an eraser on the page, the yellow begins to rub off. The paper is actually made of white pulp that is dyed with a thin layer of yellow after its made?!?! Forget about scratching with pen and ink, you'll reveal the white pulp almost instantly!

The paper is also slightly too heavy, it does resist bleed through so you can use both sides of the page, but its like thin note-cards. its quite opposite of their ""journals"" which are way too thin to ever be useful for sketching in pen. Can't they make a product in the middle? or just thin out these pages slightly?",2.0
"Not the normal moleskine, the pages are way thinner, to the point where you can see anything written on the other side.  If you're looking for a normal notebook or write moderately hard (harder than a brushstroke) then this notebook is not what you're looking for.",2.0
Paper quality is extremely poor considering the price. it hardly feels better than a $0.99 notebook. Ink bleeds through easily and you will find imprints on at least the next page. Save your money and do not bother.,2.0
"Moleskin already offers this notebook, and the other sizes of this notebook, with graph, ruled, dotted, and plain paper along with a hard or soft cover.  I do not see why moleskin has yet to offer these notebooks with green or yellow tinted paper (-1*) as well as a range of (heavier) paper weights (-1*), e.g., 85 gsm, 100 gsm, 115 gsm, 130 gsm. That is, the 70 gsm paper in this notebook, and in general, is too light. After only moderate erasing and rewriting in either .5 mm or .7 mm lead, you will engrave a brail image of your writing on the back of the page, then if you write on the back of the page you will do the same to the front and attempting to look over notes becomes a pain. Price, (-1*).",2.0
"I bought these for drawing and then immediately remembered I'd had one 10 years ago that I'd hated. Moleskin is very cagey about publishing their paper-weight unlike every single other sketchbook or journal which prints the ""GSM"" on the cover/label. Be warned though, these have been calculated to be about 70 grams/sq.in., or about 40-something lbs. The minimum for most artists is about 85 grams or 60-something lbs. So with these you get pages that are super-sheer and transparent. They are ok for strictly fountain-pens and markers. Don't try to use real inking tools though (nibs, sables, hell even brush pens) the lines don't flow and the tool tears up the paper. And even for pens and markers the lines I get are just not as nice an 85-100gsm paper. These are meant for you to write a journal in, and to draw in ballpoint--which I will try to do until they are used up. Moleskine knows that if they printed the weight on the cover--or even just sold them without plastic wrap so that people could look at the paper first--most artists wouldn't buy them. This is a shame because the size and the material for the cover make them theoretically perfect for urban/plein-air sketching. Most hardcover sketchbooks are too bulky, awkward, don't lie flat, have those awful spirals--I may take the other two and experiment with removing the cover and filling it with my own DIY sketchbook pages (some basic, heavier paper and some sheets of multi-media that can hold watercolour). The paper inside certainly wouldn't be missed if I threw it in the trash. If Moleskine made the same size/cover with better paper inside I would buy a lifetime supply!",2.0
"Paper is not what I expected since there is a lot of hype around the Moleskine books. It is fine if you're just doing pencil sketches or notes, but it is not thick, quality paper, like I was expecting. It also came with the corner already smashed--wrinkled beyond what I might be able to flatten/press out. I will use it, but will not be purchasing another one of these.",2.0
"These notebooks are not worth the money. They are thin, too expensive unlined, and poor quality. The paper is also thin. I was not happy with this purchase.",2.0
"I've come to rely on Moleskine notebooks for work, personal use, for design mock-ups, and to organize the thoughts in my head. The hard cover ones add weight to a bag, so when I found out about the soft cover version, I was thrilled.

That thrill didn't last very long.

Because the notebook doesn't lie flat, you have to crack the spine if you want to use the notebook on a flat surface. After doing that once, the cover came off. I tried using library binding glue to reattach my cover, but to no avail; the cover just won't go back on.

Not only that, but the back pocket in the soft cover version isn't as sturdy as the pocket in the hardcover editions, and it easily detaches from the back cover.

All in all, these are only worthwhile if portability/weight is more important than longevity.",2.0
"I hate rating anything Moleskine lower than 4 stars, but I have to. As with the previous commenter, the entire cover fell off. I super-glued it back on, and it fell off again. Then I tried a hot glue gun, and it worked... halfway (it is already half ""off"" again). The bottom part of the little pocket in the back is splitting as well, and some of my little papers are falling out. This is my ""work"" notebook and stays there; I don't throw it around and carry it everywhere or anything. I'll be getting a hardcover next time.",2.0
The pages fall out and the binding fails after a couple of weeks in your pocket.  Get the hard cover.,2.0

"Seller is fine, but this things are spendy. Absurdly spendy. Why so much money for small, thin, cardboard covered, few sheets? Yes, it's smooth paper and stitched, but at over $3 a piece absurdly expensive.",2.0

-Crap quality cover (I'd like to see synthetic leather, or something besides cardboard)
-Terrible useless pocket... you'll be able to squeeze 5 receipts in here at max, and it'll fling apart whenever it feels like it.
-Typical over-priced chinese product.

I feel ripped off after using the product for some time. The back pocket is pretty much useless, the covers are just generic cardboard. I would pay $5 for the three pack, but almost $9 is a ripoff, and there's nothing that ""wows"" me with these notebooks.",2.0
"I'm new at watercolor.  I wanted to take this on a trip.  After trying 200  pound cold press, this is very difficult to work on.  It soaks up paint very fast suppose it would be ok for sketching but I'll sketch with a pencil.  Washes don't work well.",2.0
"Okay these are made in Vietnam and the paper is lousy.  (Moleskine paper quality varies widely depending on the country of origin )

The paper is very thin and asborbs liquid, so ink will feather and bleed.  It is also poor for artwork, except for maybe sketching.

It is useful as a notebook using pencil or a limited selection of regular pens..  any pen that writes wet will just be problematic.

If you want watercolor or an art book, then get a Moleskine made for that purpose.

For fountain pens use the other Cahier journals..

The only positive is the price, but there are better Cahier's made in Turkey that have alot better paper quality.. though not blank.. Ruled or graph is what you will have to buy.",2.0
"Moleskine quality is a thing of the past. The paper in these cahier's is so scratchy now, not even a ""toothy"" surface, it feels like writing on a fine grit sanding paper when I try to use my fine-tipped pens. The ghosting/shadowing/show-through of the pen to the other side of the page is horrible. Inky/wet pens and markers bleed through easily to the next page. So no highlighting or felt tips or and no fountain pens if buy these to use with those types of pens. Two stars because the construction is still good: lays flat and the binding and cover holds up. But if paper quality is a factor for you look elsewhere.",2.0
"This product is great, but it was damaged when I received it. The bottom, unbound edge on all three of the notebooks is bent and ripped.",2.0

I wanted the notebook with lined paper and because the product description was so incredibly poor, it was difficult to know if it did or didn't. I discovered when they arrived that they were blank pages - no lines.

"I was very disappointed to find out these little books are Made In China.  That's right, for all the talk about tradition and their history and all that BS, they are Made In China.  I thus don't take any pride in having this little book and feel that is why I keep forgetting it at home.  It is a small book, and it is able to be written on, so, it does that job.  I don't like that the pages are perforated, especially because the book is already small enough and the perforations effectively take about 10% of the already small writing space away.  I would say that a fair price on this pair of little books is probably closer to $2.50 given that they are not made in Italy (or even Europe) as one could have safely assumed from the company website and poetic descriptions of their product.",2.0
"Although I like the water color paper, Moleskine and I have a very different definition of what constitutes ""large."" This book is tiny, more like a little planner than a large notebook.

This paper is so thin the ink bleeds through terribly. I read all the other reviews that say exactly that but I thought maybe it would be different for my fountain pen. Not so. I suspect that even rollerball pens would bleed through the thin paper. Beautiful journal though. The whole thing is kind of flimsy -- it's definitely not a hard cover. The spine itself is pretty stiff so the cover and pages don't really fold down very flat. If you're looking for a large journal you can roll up and you use pencil or ball point this might work well.,2.0

When I got these, however, I was very, very disappointed for they have changed!  The lines are much darker, slightly thicker and the pages are a different hue now.  Ugh.  I used to love these notebooks, they were perfect, but now I just can't get used to the darker lines -- they are too much of a distraction.  Not cool, that was what had me committed to them for years. I wrote them and although I got a quick response, I didn't get any indication that they were going to make any changes any time soon.  I wish they could go back.  I figure if they can make Minnie Mouse and Star Wars versions, maybe they could have versions with lighter lines?  Until that happens, my Moleskine days are over.  I'll keep checking back or look for pre-2011 versions, but if you are used to the lighter lines, don't bother!",2.0
"This purchase was disappointing.  The soft cover is not at all what I expected.  It's really cheap looking, just black paper on what seems to be a flimsy pliable cardboard.  The edge was already slightly damaged from the wrap-around label.  I should have returned it.  But I decided that the $14 I'd paid for it (probably the clearance price) wasn't enough to bother with.  I had planned on using it for a journal or diary.  But it doesn't seem nice enough to use for anything special.  So I'll keep it around as a project notebook.  The paper seems nice enough, and I like it that it can be folded back to make it easy to write on both sides of the pages.  The extra large size turns out to be too large for writing while holding it on my lap, especially since it is quite flexible and won't tend to lie flat unless it is used on a flat surface.  I don't understand why anyone would rave about how nice this is.  The cover, especially, reminds me of a piece of flat black, cheap construction paper.",2.0

"Moleskine came a very long way, and I felt disappointed. Paper quality took a drop from the early 2000's: it practically sucks up ink, making a mess: bleedthrough, feathering, destroys any sheen or shading you ink might hope to have. The only way of not ruining the sketches I'm collecting is using only one side of every page.",2.0
"I ordered this sketchbook quite a while ago and sadly I regret buying it. I compared my sketchbook to my friend's. Several differences were apparent:
Friend's moleskine had even, smooth creamy paper
My moleskine is paper that is covered in a streaky yellowish stain, the actual color of the paper underneath is a normal white
Friend's moleskine took water media very well
The wet media for my moleskine doesn't take to the paper; it actually beads up as if the paper is waterproof (also similar to the effect when you leave an oily fingerprint on a surface and then try to watercolor over it)
It is not a pleasure to draw or paint in because the paper just doesn't take the mediums well..so now it's just sitting in a corner . What a waste.",2.0
"First, you just can't beat the Moleskine form factor. It's compact, the cover is rigid but not too rigid. The cover sticks out over the pages just the right amount. The rounded corners make it extremely durable. And it lays flat.

The paper is relatively thick and, structurally, it holds up well to wet media.

The problem is the paper surface. When using wet media, you just don't know how It's going to react. Some parts of the paper seem to be coated with wax. Ink and watercolor beads up on those parts. It wouldn't be so bad if all the paper was like that but it varies from page to page and worst of all it's inconsistent on the same page. You can be drawing with ink ok on one part and then all of a sudden it starts beading up in you.

I am disappointed. I attached a picture so you can see what I was talking about.",2.0
The quality of this sketch book had gone down with out a doubt. The paper is thinner and less smooth. even the size seem ever so slightly smaller. disappointing to this happen to a great  brand like this.,2.0
I do not like the Volant's plasticky covers.  It also looks and feels much cheaper than every other Moleskine product I have ever owned.  I would say that a good use for these would be as field journals but there are other products designed for field work that have waterproof paper for a similar price. I am giving these to my daughters to use as they see fit.  Moleskine's products have always been great but the Volant is a dud for me.,2.0
"Product is made in China. Paper color is off white and it's not really a pleasant color, a little too yellow for my taste. More importantly is the performance. The paper is really mediocre at the best. I used Pelikan M600 Fine nib. The paper's dry time is on the fast side; however, the paper bleed through much easier than Rhodia or Clairefontaine. I couldn't even use Diamine Red Dragon on this paper because it bleeds through completely. Noodler's black and Pelikan turquoise behave pretty well, but those are known to behave well on bad paper. I'm very disappointed to say the least. This paper is barely better than Mead paper. I'm not buying more Moleskine products in the future and gifting the other one to my friend who uses ballpoint pen. Moleskine's quality has really gone down the drain in recent years.

Stunningly few pages and flimsy materials mean that this will not last you long.,2.0
"A while ago I purchased a blank Piccadilly notebook, which is a pretty cheap Moleskine knockoff (complete with black faux-leather cover and interior pocket), for drawing. I really like it except that the pages are too thin, so I purchased a proper Moleskine Art Plus Sketchbook from a local store.

I know this isn't specifically a watercolor sketchbook, but every plain Moleskine notebook I've ever used has taken water-based media fairly well, and most of my art supplies are water-based (water-based markers, some types of pen ink) so I was pretty excited to start making test pages. But every water-based thing I used on this beaded horribly, because the paper is coated in some kind of water-resistant material that makes even saturated marker swatches turn into pastels. Sakura Pigma Micron pens turn out grey and only Sharpies really hit a nice deep black. I found out online you can get rid of that coating by wiping down all the pages with a wet paper towel, so I did that, and now it looks a million times better (see photo 1; the coated paper is on the left, the uncoated is on the right). If you want to use any kind of water-based media on this, I HIGHLY recommend you wipe down the pages beforehand. Maybe leave a corner of each page uncoated for mixing purposes, but wipe down everything else.

So after figuring out I had to spend half an hour treating all the pages before I could get this to work like an actual sketchbook, you know what's even better? Finding out that the cream color actually COMES OFF THE PAGES when you erase. Incredible. Also, the first two pages of my book were stuck together, so I pulled them apart and you can see the white between them (see photo 2).

I am absolutely amazed at how shoddy this product is. Even the material on the cover of my book is buckled and bumpy on the spine. Everything about it is lower quality than its Piccadilly knockoff, aside from the thickness of the pages. Granted, after pretreating the pages it's a perfectly serviceable sketchbook, but if spiral bound pages aren't a dealbreaker for you, I'd recommend getting a Strathmore Visual Journal instead.",2.0
"It's hard to tell the difference from the description. The Moleskin I've been journaling in for the last year has a softish cover so when I went to reorder I selected the soft cover. While it's OK, it doesn't have the resilience on what I now assume is the hard cover. There's not any significant weight or other advantage that I can see so go with the hard cover if you want something that will stand up better - especially if you're going to be traveling with it.",2.0
"They changed the paper thickness and color.  The books are still priced the same, but are made with much cheaper methods.  Upon opening one of the newer models, you can easily detect the thinness of the paper and the unappealing off-white and greenish color of the new sheets.",2.0
"I purchased these quickly in order to meet the 12pm deadline for same-day shipping, thinking that ""soft cover"" meant that it was soft leather or faux leather like a traditional moleskine notebook. I was looking for something to write lists and such in that would fit easily in my purse, but be sturdier than your average $.99 small notepad. The description says cardboard, but it's very flimsy cardboard - I would say it's roughly the thickness and sturdiness of a piece of poster board, with the texture of construction paper. I will accept partial responsibility for not reading the product description thoroughly. However, even putting my expectations aside, this is not a product I can recommend or rate highly. I have purchased sturdier notebooks with more pages from the dollar section of Target, so I'm highly annoyed that I paid around ten bucks for three of these.",2.0
"This review is specifically for the Moleskine notebook itself, and not the delivery of said notebook. Amazon delivered the product fast and intact, as per usual.

I don't know what happened, but the newer Moleskine notebooks are atrocious. I specifically purchase the Sketchbooks because I love the feel of the thick paper, and I use ink, so I know that it won't bleed through the page. These new notebooks are an extreme disappointment:

- The pages of these new Moleskins (and I purchased several to make sure I didn't get a dud), are thinner than previous generations
- The pages are also rougher than they used to be - the smooth quality of the page that I used to love is not as smooth anymore, and the paper starts to tear much sooner if you attempt to erase too much (you can actually see the change happening when you erase anything on the page)
- Worst of all, the pages of this notebook, rather than being a light cream color, as most Moleskines have been, has now deepened to an olmost yellow color - making the notebook look as if it is 50 years old even before you've used it.

If you aren't picky about your notebooks and paper color, and just want a decent notebook with thick pages, then you might consider this Moleskine (though I think you will find the price a deterrant). If you remember the old Moleskines and are looking for that experience, I recommend going elsewhere - I know I am looking for a replacement.",2.0
"Relatively overpriced notebooks bearing the Moleskine name, but little else.  Its size is something of a catch-22:  Clearly intended to be a book that is easy to carry around in a purse or a pocket for quick note-taking, but with laughably cheap construction that means it won't possibly survive in these environments.  For example, after carrying one around in the front pocket of my jeans for a week or two, I noticed that it was already getting smashed, ripped, and crushed along the top and bottom.  Ironically, the safest place for such a notebook is in a desk drawer--but if that's the case, why wouldn't you just settle for a larger book that's easier to write in?

If you're thinking of carrying around something that's this size--and if you intend on writing notes in it that are remotely important to you--I'd recommend something sturdier like a ""Rite-in-the-Rain"" notebook or a Field Notes book.  They're expensive, yes, but at least you won't be left with three books that a dollar-store Mead pad would give a run for its money.

These Cahiers are an embarrassment to the Moleskine brand, and the only reason that I didn't give them a single star was because, yes, you can in fact write in them and they won't immediately dissolve or burst into flames.",2.0
"I got this for bullet journaling, the paper that was used in this product was really thin, the quality of the paper is not good at all. It is kind of transparent, the ink bleeds and it leaves some pages unusable. It really disappointed me. The hard cover has some white stains on it that I could not do anything to fix it. I decided to return it but I already write a few pages and I can not return it. I just have to get rid of it. Paying 17$ and I need to go but another journal.",2.0
"These books are a great size and shape to fit inside a pocket, but they are simply unfit to be carried in a pocket. The cover is very flimsy and after a week of carrying it in the pocket of my pants, it has already been bent and is beginning to lose its form.",2.0
"This is my third Moleskine sketchbook. I bought the first two at least five years ago. I wanted this one for a particular project and when I found it on Amazon, I clicked through the 1star reviews because I couldn't believe anyone would give these books 1 star. I read the complaints: the paper has changed, it's thinner and more yellow. And I thought, no way. I thought these reviews must be from some pretty picky professional artists and I figured I would never be able to tell a difference.

I opened my package and instantly compared it to one of my older Moleskines. I could see immediately that the new book was somewhat thinner, which didn't bode well for the thickness of the pages. Sure enough, comparing pages, I won't say that the new book's pages are flimsy, but they are NOT as good as the old ones. I might not have noticed that if I wasn't looking for it, but I guarantee I would have noticed the paper colour. The older books had a yellow/creamy tint. I was unsure about that at first, but have grown to love it. The new book? Well, it might not be a Crayola Lemon Yellow, but it's FAR more yellow than it should be. Kind of sickly.

So far, pencils seem to be fine, although extra-hard to erase and the Pigma Micron ink seems to set on the page well without bleeding through.

Two stars because it's obviously a lesser quality than it used to be and it's not really the display piece I was hoping for.",2.0
I will never buy moleskin again. There is better quality paper in less expensive note books. Not worth the price.,2.0
"The book is as always very well made, the paper also being of good weight and texture. The paper has a creme colour which looks nice but, and this is the big downside of this sketch book, if you use an eraser you not only erase your pencil markings but also the colour of the paper revealing a pure white beneath. For a relatively expensive small sketchbook this is a critical mistake in my view and the reason i only give it two stars. When making a sketchbook the primary consideration should be the paper.",2.0
tiny and not worth the money,2.0
Moleskin but cheap thin  junk. I expected better.,2.0
It really is too small to be very useful.,2.0
"I have been using the Moleskine Sketchbook Large for a long time and have recently run out of my big stock of this great product. Imagine my dismay when I bought a new one on a recent trip to the States. The edge of the sketchbook was white, but the surface of the pages was a definite acid yellow, instead of the usual very light and elegant cream paper stock. The paper quality is not the same, and when I tried to put a light colour wash over the surface, the water reacted in a waxy manner. I used to be a graphic designer, and I know my paper stocks. I suspect that a cheaper paper is now being used and that the Yellow colour has been overprinted, hence the 'resist' reaction of my colour washes AND the fact that some reviewers have found white marks after using an eraser on the page surface. I understand that like all else, production cost plays an important part in today's economy (these are now produced in China instead of Italy), but I for one, will no longer use this item which has truly lost its well known quality. Pity!",2.0
"I ordered the 'paper back' and with that cheap price I should have known, but this product is not real Moleskine!",2.0
No mention of the color paper in the Moleskine sketchbook. It shows white on the side but it is darker inside the book. I was disappointed. I read the reviews after I bought it and some called it creamy. I wouldn't use that 'creamy' in my coffee. Too dark for me. I guess I don't get why the paper is toned.,2.0
"As a bartender, I can't live without my moleskine. It is a great way to organize all of my recipes and it fits in my bar apron perfectly. Unfortunately, I did not receive my book because the lazy people that work for Lasership decided that leaving my package on top of the trashcan in my building's mailroom would be a great idea. I had no idea that this was their method of delivering until I went down to the mailroom TWICE this week and saw packages left on top of the trash can by Lasership. Why they did not take the elevator up a few more floors to leave it in front of my door really baffles me. Pure laziness. I know it's not entirely Moleskine's fault, but please choose a different company to deliver your products. It's unacceptable that I have paid money for something that I won't be receiving. What a shame... :(",2.0
"I was looking for a smaller alternative to my main notepad, the excellent Tops Computation Notebook, for travel.  I picked up the Moleskine address book by mistake at an airport, as I only needed a standard rule without tabs.  I didn't even though they made those any more!

Well, I could have used it as a general notebook anyway, but the paper is very thin and the ink bled through.  I used either a Faber Castell Finepen 1511 or a Sharpie pen (not a regular sharpie) to write with.  I threw it away, as I'd already passed airport security.  Lesson learned.

I will probably get a Paper Blanks note book.  They look a little Harry Potter-ish, but they're wonderful notebooks.",2.0
"wait a minute... is it supposed to be same as hardcover in terms of paper quality? I have found that paper quality and character to receive INK is different... anyone noticed? my fountain pen used to glide on the surface, this version is sort of stuck, not able to write as I used to...",2.0
These are REALLY SMALL MINI SUPER TINY. I guess I didn't read description properly but I can barely fit in 5-6 sentences in one page in one of these things.,2.0
"I don't personally like them, but my husband did. The outer part of the book is made from a thin kind of cardboard material. Thicker than paper, but doesn't look very durable.",2.0
"I've been writing in Moleskine journals for 10 years, and always enjoyed the consistent high quality  until now. This last notebook I bought just felt wrong as soon as I opened it. The cover felt lighter, the edges a bit sharper, less durable. Then I wrote on the first page with a gel pen, nothing crazy, just a black Pilot G-2. The writing is visible on the other side of the page. My previous notebooks didn't show through at all with the exact same pen.

I've carried Moleskine journals around for years on end and had them remain perfectly intact. I really don't have high hopes for this one.",2.0
"Love moleskine, but this item arrived with a dented spine. I needed it for a gift so wasn't able to return. Maybe better off supporting a local vendor with your moleskine purchases.",2.0
"I typically use Moleskine pocket cahiers, which are larger than these extra small notebooks.  I tried these because I wanted something smaller I could stick in my pocket.  These plastic covers would ""seem"" to be so much more durable than the cardboard cahiers but they are not.  The plastic cover separates from the notebook.  It's pretty ugly.  I had to use clear tape to secure all 4 corners as all were peeling badly.  Back to the cahiers for me.  I wish Moleskine would make cahiers in this extra small size.",2.0
Be careful to search and read the dimensions of the sketch book. I was expecting the LARGE to be 8 and 1/2 inch by 11 like most large books...this is 5 by 7 or 8...not what I call large.,2.0
"I WOULD like this notebook if it wasn't for my bullet journal.
It's the never ending battle between two popular brands for bullet journal fans.
I have to say, I can't choose this side of the fan boat.
It was thin paper, very easy to see on other side. Also, doesn't hold well together.",2.0
"I have to say, it's a notebook, not a lifestyle choice. The elastic band is nice for keeping it closed (hence the two star rating), and there's a handy pocket in the back for loose stuff, but other than that, not much I can say about it. Don't expect to be able to use it like a normal notebook that you can tear pages out of. If you start tearing pages out of this one, it won't be long before it's completely falling apart. It's not designed for that type of use.

My verdict: This is way overpriced for a notebook full of blank pages. But Moleskine seems to be one of the things now days that the trendy people have to have. Goes with the Starbucks triple shot mocha, iPhone obsessed, North Face jacket wearing crowd. My advice, you could buy 40 regular notebooks at the grocery store for the price of one of these.",2.0
"This notebook is too small. It is about the size of my wallet and hard to write in, also it is very thin so it does not hold up to abuse in my pocket as the pages get bent. I prefer my field notes notebook.",2.0
"This is MY fault for not reading the whole description.....but when the Title Description states that this is LARGE, it certainly is NOT......it's 5""x8"".  C'mon, Amazon.",2.0
The skectchbook is advertised as large but is in effect a small sketchbook with many pages (is that the large part - who knows?),2.0
"I needed a journal for an upcoming journey to South America and initially was going to buy Moleskine.  Before I made a purchase, I happened to visit Powell's Bookstore in my beloved Portland and found a similar journal made by a company called Ecosystem.  (Amazon sells Ecosystem too:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ecosystem-Journal-Blank-Medium-Grape-Flexicover-ecosystem-Series/dp/1607365103/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ecosystem Journal Blank: Medium Grape Flexicover (ecosystem Series)</a>).  In my humble opinion, the Ecosystem Journal blows Moleskine products out of the water.  Here are my top five reasons:

1. Ecosystem journals are made of 100% post-consumer recycled paper.  Moleskine are not.  On Moleskine's website, under their ""Social Responsibility"" section, Moleskine states ""It is our privilege to make objects that by their nature are not disposable and will never become obsolete,"" and they go on to say they make them out of acid-free paper. Really?  No recycled material?  Social responsibility?  Okay.

2. Ecosystem is made in the U.S.A.  Moleskine: where most of our stuff comes from - China.

3. The quality of Ecosystem is great.  I've started using it and absolutely love it.  Paper is high quality, doesn't bleed through.  The journal feels solid.  Has nice features like a bookmark, an elastic band to keep it closed when not using, an inside pocket, and cool colors.  I love it.

4. Moleskine has a warning (required by California law) that some materials used in Moleskine production may be hazardous.  (See Amazon listing for Moleskine products for this warning).  Not so with Ecosystem's products.  This reason alone should be enough!

5.  Ecosystem is actually cheaper than Moleskine.

Seems a no-brainer to me.  Buy what you want, but I was so glad I bought Ecosystem's product that I wanted to post this.  I'm hoping more and more people in our country (and the world) start voting with their wallet and making a change in the world in this way.  As paraphrased from Gandhi's teachings:  Be the change you wish to see in the world.  Peace to you, good luck with your decision, and happy journaling whichever way you choose.

Peace, Christopher",2.0
"Moleskines are lauded as quality notebooks, but they suffer from poor paper. The paper in these notebooks seems to be the same feathering, bleed through prone paper that is put in the bigger Moleskines. And don't be fooled by the picture, these little notebooks do not have the same smooth cover as the regular Moleskines. The outer cover of these is nothing more than thick black card stock.

When I originally bought these they were around $3.00 for three, and as of this review (3/29/12) they are almost $9.00. They're handy little notebooks worth checking out at $3.00, but at $9.00 they're a complete waste of money, especially considering how bad the paper is.

If you need a little notebook, consider one of Rhodia's offerings. They feature some of the best paper in the world that's fountain pen (and even flex pen) friendly.",2.0
"I was hopping for a bit better construction, shortly after getting it the cover started to separate to the point that I had to tape the sides.",2.0
"OK - No extra value but not a rip-off either. Simply a ""you get what you pay for"" type of purchase.",2.0
"I used these sketchbooks as long as I can remember. Now, the last 3 I've purchased all make my brush pens and calligraphy pens bead up and become maybe 50% opaque. The change in paper and the current Moleskins is just not good. I've had to switch brands after years.",2.0
"Basically, the paper is nearly impermeable to water-based inks and watercolors.  Gel pens,  ballpoints, and pencils work OK.  Otherwise, try to use a fountain pen (I used a couple Noodler's inks) / watercolors and the ink will bead up and look terrible.  I can't imagine why they decided to use this paper, it sucks.",2.0
"Although the size of this notebook is perfect to have a notepad handy at all times, it didn't hold up to life in my back or front pocket long enough for the price. The cover tended to wear out from the friction of moving around in my pocket and the detachable pages detached prematurely so I ended up not keeping any notes that I wanted to keep long term in the notebook. I eventually found some mini composition books at the local dollar store (available on amazon also). The first of three has lasted 5 months in my back pocket with no sign of falling apart and no pages lost.",2.0
"Here is my original review:
These are the nicest notebooks I have ever used.  I take this everywhere and haven't seen it get messed up or look used yet.  I am addicted to this and it is an awesome price.

However, I was disappointed that it didn't hold up.  If you use this as a notebook and expect to shoved in and our of a bag, you want to know it holds up.  That is why I got a hard cover.  I love the feel of writing in it in as a bulletjournal' and I like the fact I can use the squared format, I wish it would have held up better.  I was quarter of a way through it when the corners began to tear, about half way through it when the notebook disconnected from the spine, and ended up having to move to a new one once I got 80% of the way through because pages were falling out.

I'm in the market for a better bound book in the same size with the squared pages.",2.0
"To be honest, it is not deserve of this price.",2.0
"The actual size of this item was shockingly small, and of marginal quality. Certainly not worth $11. However if you have a special project like a film and want something portable to keep tabs on each shot, this booklet is kinda nice, especially since the hardcover makes it a nice keepsake when the project is done.",2.0
"It is a great idea but the notebook needs to be the next moleskin size up, and there isn't another size.  I read the dimensions but it didn't click as to how small it is until you get it.

I feel its too small for my needs and am disappointed to doesn't come in any other size.",2.0
"If only I'd known: Moleskine paper is not at all fountain pen friendly. I've had $0.10 notebooks from Walmart that exhibit less feathering and bleed-through than this one does. That said, it does perform decently enough with pencil and rollerball/ballpoint ink, and the cover material and binding do feel good. All in all, not worth the price, especially if you intend to use a fountain pen.",2.0
"Average quality control: it came with some pages glued together (excess glue?) and the bookmark ribbon suddenly came off (I didn't even use it that much, as this happened only after writing two or three pages). For a Moleskine product, I would have expected a much better product.",2.0
"Defect on the binding.
Difficult to return item as it already in Europe: Belarus, Minsk. Will be very expensive to send it back.",2.0
"If you are using fountain pens, get the Leuchtturm. if you are using any other pen - consider the Leuchttrum! The Moleskine quality I felt was disappointing.",2.0

"Coming from Europe, I find the overall situation with squared notebooks in the US weird. It is like hunting antiquities. This particular notebook is low on pages and sheets are very thin and yellowish. Definitely overpriced.",2.0
"Boy howdy, this sure is a nice little notebook, but what it's NOT is a reporter notebook. Why? Because reporter notebooks are 4x8. Let us examine why: A 4x8 notebook fits in most back and many front pockets. It is easy to write in a reporter notebook with the opposable thumb, the ring finger and the little finger holding the notebook while at the same time, the index middle fingers hold a digital recorder as if it were a cigar. Despite the compact and portable size, the reporter notebook has a a decent amount of space for note taking. That's why most reporters -- those lying, leftist, corporate rightwing apologist, white priveliged, Obama loving professionals -- use reporter notebooks.

This thing has some good qualities: it is far more durable than a regular reporter notebook, and it has a lot of pages. But it is too dinky to be practical for anything other than your big ideas and grocery lists. It's shortness actually makes it awkward. C-minus. Elsewhere, I review the large Moleskin reporter notebook, which is also not an actual reporter notebook.

(I'm sure some reporter will come on here and say it's perfect and I'm full of crap, but I'll let you in on a little secret: he's a plagiarist.)",2.0
It comes in two! unfortunately they're such a tiny dimension they were completely useless to me when I received them and found out how small they are. I cut them in half and made them into flip books (but they were even a crummy dimension for that purpose). I won't be buying this product again.,2.0
"I loved my Axim X-30 high. Didn't know how I'd ever lived without one. Read books, watched movies, checked my e-mail on the go ... wonderful! However, after owning it for a year and six months (thus out of warranty), I turned it on one morning to be greeting by a solid, white screen. Hard and soft reset had no effect. Switching batteries didn't help.

Then I discovered that Dell charges you $39 just to TALK to someone who can initiate the repair process on an out-of-warranty item. There's no place to take it or send it in. You have to go through the phone number that charges you up front before you can even talk to someone about repairs. That just doesn't seem right to me, and I'm disappointed at how soon my Axim (which was very well cared for and never dropped or roughly handled) stopped working. Complaints to customer service just get me canned responses.",2.0
Basket is too small to adequately fit a surge protector without bending the metal so you can maneuver the surge protector. This is not at all thebestway to do this. Using Velcro or a box with the surge protector in it which hides the wires (can be found at Home Depot) is much better. I have taken mine down and discarded it in lieu of Velcro which worked much better.,2.0
It is very studry and durable but yet it's pretty small for what I wanted it for. Plus I just seen the pretty much same cart at walk mart for 29.99 so it's just sitting around because I can't use it,2.0
Very disappointed. I bought this cart less than a month ago. It's been gently used on rugs and hardwood floors with nothing overly heavy in it (crafting supplies). One of the wheels has broken off already at a welding point.,2.0
"the product was very good! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because you can get the exact same thing for 49.99 at IKEA.

This is a great product, just priced way too high on amazon.",2.0
Marking kit was described as not bleeding through the pages.  Markers definitely bleed through the page!!  Markers are ok just not so much for using in the bible!,2.0
"Only received part of my order,  the ruler was missing",2.0
Please beware that the product does in fact bleed through just like any regular highlighter and pen.  It looks fancy and professes to provide something special but it's a lie.  Don't fall for it!  And there is no refund for this product.,2.0
The highlighters bleed and show through the pages when it says they don't. The colors are also very dark which makes it hard to read the words and is what makes them show through the pages.,2.0
Very similar to any other highlighter. Doesnt rip the pages or smudge but definitely can be seen thru bible pages. Basically a fancy double edge highlighter. Ruler also lists books of the Bible. I like the ruler cuz it helps me to underline straight. But one of my markers came dried/damaged.,2.0
The blue and green pen are too dark to read bible verses through.  The darkness shows through to the back of the page for verses I did not want to highlight. They appear to be just everyday highlighters instead of being made for bible highlighting.,2.0
"Was excited to get these for my bible. Found that all colors but yellow bleed through the pages, not just a little, but a lot. So where I highlighted, the back side of the page looks like I highlighted that as well. The yellow was the only one that did not bleed through, but I think that is because it is almost dried out. There is hardly any color with the yellow.",2.0
I was really disappointed with these colors.  The only color that DID NOT bleed though my Bible page was the yellow.  And the pages were a little thicker than most.,2.0
"These bleed right through the pages, just like regular highlighters. Nothing special about their functionality. Disappointed.",2.0
"This pen was one of the worst I have ever used and I am glad I tried it on regular paper a few times before thinking about writing in my study bible.
This pen bleeds through thin pages, ink splotches and gobs up at times and one of the ink's didn't even work at all.
I did find a better Bible pen that lives up to the claims made by ZEBRITE.",2.0
Advertised as no bleed. Not true.,2.0
The pink color did not work. Cheap product too disappointing,2.0
"As much as I'd love to give this product a good review, the highlighters work just as well as my bic highlighters which were half the price. I use a journaling bible with a little thincker paper. The ink very lightly bleeds through but nothing that is too distracting on the next page. These work well as highlighters but I don't see the point in paying extra for the product.",2.0
kind of cheap quality,2.0
"While the colors are fine and there is little bleed through (there IS bleed but it is minimal), when you remove the cap from the ""broad"" highlight end, it doesn't fit on the back of the ""fine"" tip as you expect...you're stuck holding the cap (distracting from your reading/study) or you have to put it down and risk it rolling away, falling, getting lost, etc.  Poor design ruins what would be a beneficial bible study accessory.",2.0
They bleed through the paper and I'm not pressing too hard.,2.0
"loved the fine tip and ink, did not last long at all. 2weeks tops",2.0
"I cannot get the pens to write without tearing the paper. Great idea, but mine, at least, is a dud.",2.0
"It's packaged nicely and works well as a highlighter, which is why I didn't give it 1 star. Totally not what it claims to be. It bleeds through heavily! It's not even a light tinge that you have to look for on the other side of the page through the light or something. It bleeds through just as a normal highlighter would! I won't be using these on my bible anymore, will probably have to resort to using them on other textbooks and etc. Disappointing, because one use of the product makes it so abundantly clear that it's not bleed-proof. How could they claim to be?",2.0
"This pen seemed like a great idea, however, many colors don't write correctly and it's difficult to get them to start writing.",2.0
Fell apart.,2.0
"While the pen arrived on time, as advertised, it does not perform well, and one color (yellow) does not work at all. While I will order from this seller in the future I am disappointed in this product. It may be that it was stored over long, I do not know, but it simply does not perform as it should.",2.0
"I found nothing special about these at all other than that they are double tipped.  Even if I am careful, they bleed through. However, the Bibles I am using have very thin paper, even for Bibles.  The best solution I have found is a red art pencil.  It's underlined instead of highlighted, but it gets the job done consistently.",2.0
"Contrary to it's claims, these highlighters did bleed through  my bible's pages.  The pen that came with it (for margin notes) was also dry, I couldn't get it to write on the pages.  I think I'll stick to my dry highlighters.",2.0
I ordered these specifically to use with my Bible. The marking pen and highlighters all show through the fine pages to the opposite side. There is no way I can use these in my Bible. Too bad.,2.0
"These are double tipped which is nice. They have a thick end and a thin end. However, they do bleed. I am displeased with this purchase. I would not buy them again.",2.0
"They advertise that they don't bleed through the pages. They don't literally bleed through as if it were a permanent marker, but I can definitely see the color clearly through the other page. So much so that it's distracting to try to read the other side page because of the highlights from the previous side. I don't like them. Will not be using them anymore.",2.0
"After product being on backorder for several weeks, what I got didn't come with the straight edge as shown.  Disappointed.",2.0
The underlining pen was dried out by the time I got it. Other than that it was fine I guess.,2.0

"These markers do bleed through.  No matter how light I highlight, it bleeds through to the other side.  It is incorrect that it will not bleed through the page.  I received a very nice Bible for Christmas and each time I highlight with these markers, it bleeds to the other side.  It is false advertisement to say these do not bleed through.  Disappointed.",2.0
"I found this cover on Amazon but ordered directly from the seller's website.

The Twilight Blue is a beautiful, rich greenish blue. That's the only good thing I can say about this product.

My cover also has obvious construction flaws. First, the corners are inexpertly rounded. It looks like someone trimmed them with a pair of scissors to make a rounded shape. They aren't even, and they aren't attractive. Second, the cover was glued together before sewing. The glue has oozed out onto the edges of the leather and feels unpleasantly sticky. It certainly doesn't have the level of craftsmanship that I expected.

I tried to return the cover, but I can't get in touch with the seller. They don't respond to messages sent to the contact email address listed on their website. I tried calling the phone number on their website and the mailbox is full. I'll keep trying; I've received two newsletters from the seller since trying to contact them for a return, so they must be out there somewhere.

If you are interested in purchasing this item, I suggest going through Amazon rather than the seller's site. Amazon may provide you with some conflict resolution assistance if your cover is a dud like mine.

Edited 11/15/2013 to add:

The seller responded to a later email sent to their service email address, the one that sends out their newsletters. They offered to make a new cover for me or issue a refund.

They acknowledged a problem with their voicemail system and a problem with spam messages flooding their inbox, so I got the impression that I'm not the only customer who experienced difficulty contacting them.

I changed my rating from 1 star to 2 stars because they showed interest in making things right, but I still don't like the cover I received and I won't buy from them again.",2.0
"NOT laminated.  Heavy stock, coated.  As such, it arrived rolled but quite wrinkled / uneven in several places on the map, I think, as a result of it being rolled too tightly before it was shrinkwrapped.

"I am basing this review mostly on subjective experience and perhaps some objective. I was on a search for the perfect KJV Bible that would be my main Bible for the rest of my life. I got a very nice KJV Bible with Thumb-Index; but I quickly became aware that I needed a notetakers Bible as I like my notes to be directly beside the verses and not crammed in a margin. So, I ordered a KJV Journal Bible, hardback, didn't like it too much, then I found the perfect KJV Bible, the Notetakers KJV 3 piece Iron calf skinned leather executive edition. With the 2.5 inch horizontal column on the right side. The perfect Bible for me.... but no thumb-index. I attempted to put these on, as soon as I started the first one I could tell that it was going to look fairly sloppy and if I ever wanted them off I'd have to rip my pages. In order for this to look neat you have to be very VERY careful and make sure you get them as perfect as you can. Unlike a thumb-indexed Bible, these are sticking out of the side and it kinda has that arts & crafts look to it. Which is okay if that's your thing. These are fairly cheap, so if you plan on getting them and like that look, I'd still order two packs and try a Bible that isn't your favorite one first. Lest you ruin your favorite Bible.
BTW, if you're wondering what Bible I purchased; I am in NO way affiliated with the company but their Bibles are almost too good to be true if you need single column KJV with a huge space to write on every single page. It is called the 3 piece executive edition iron calfskin notetakers Bible. It's not one of those that just has large margins. I'll include some pictures of it. The Bible would normally sell for well over 200 or even 300 dollars, however the company that publishes it is a small place and they rely on Donations, so they only charge 60 dollars for it and if you can pay them more then do so. Just google, ""Local Church Bible Publishers."" It can be found in other stores but the price is much higher. Micron 005 pens as well as gel highlighters work great with it. Included examples in the photos. It's also not as heavy as you might think, big font and I use it as an everyday Bible.",2.0

"Wish I had read the critical reviews on this before ordering.
I've been happily using this planner for at least 5 years, and they have made some changes which I don't like.

1. The faded print is creating an eye strain.
2. The new layout is providing less space to write. If I had wanted that, I would have gotten the smaller edition to begin with.
3. The elastic band no longer retracts, when not in use. It just hangs there. I might have to cut it off.

"I bought this planner for 2017 and loved it, so I purchased the 2018 planner in the same Turquoise color. The older planner used good quality paper and the printing was crisp. The new 2018 planner is a big step down in quality. The printing is not sharp. The text is harsh black instead of the softer gray of last year. The rounded corner cuts are jagged and sloppy. The 2017 planner also had yellow contrasting elastic which made the planner stand out more. As a graphic designer who has developed products similar to these, I can tell you some corners were cut for the 2018 version. The previous product was similar to Moleskine in quality, this one by comparison feels pretty cheap. I'm very happy with the system of the planner, so I will probably keep it, but I wish it was as nice as last year's version.",2.0

"I carefully read the product description for many agendas before ordering this one but some things are not in the descriptions so I hope this review is helpful to the seller and they buyer alike.

What I like:
Size (goldielocks size - just big enough)
Spiral for easy opening and closing and lays flat to write on
Page Layout - Weekly planner with places for goals, tasks, appointments, delegation, etc.  (Nice)
Pages for notes and pages with useful information

What I dislike: Paper color and printing.
The paper is beige and the printing is a light gray.  To make matters worse, the font is small and thin.  It's painful for me to read the darn thing, even in bright light.  OK, admittedly I'm over thirty but my eyesight is pretty good.  This agenda is printed like a menu at a fancy restaurant that nobody can read because the owner thinks an elegant look is the most important thing.  Wrong!  Menus (and agendas) must be readable.  The paper color and print is a deal breaker, and I am sad I have to return the Action Day Agenda and look for one that is readable.

Two were Spiral bound, while the other was hard bound, like a book. The hard binding is MUCH better, as the Spiral binding gets stuck easily. One Spiral and the hard bound planner each have a cool ""pocket"" in the back, but one Spiral bound book had no pocket. Last, two of the planners had a loop to hold a pen, and they were the hard bound book and the Spiral bound book with no pocket, but the loop on one book broke by the third use. I just found it very odd that I ordered three books, all of which came with different features than the others, and I had a difficult time giving them to their intended recipients because they weren't the same. I wish I had three hard bound planners with pockets and a pen holder that were the three colors offered, and I would be very happy with this purchase because the inside setup is fantastic!",2.0

"Details: Academic calendar running from July to July. Inspirational advice/tips at the front for those who want it.  A few pages of monthly calendars and then each double page shows a weekly schedule.  At the back, many blank pages for notes and a yearly calendar detailing notable dates. Rest of planner: Left hand page: half is a column of things to do, then 2/3 of remaining half is hourly space for Monday/Tuesday. Lower third of remaining half is for delegating teamwork and projects.  Right hand page: top 2/3 is Wednesday - Friday hourly planner and last column shared for Saturday/Sunday.  Bottom 1/3 of right page: place to note your projects/goals/achievements for the week.

Pros: Sturdy construction, good quality cover and paper.  Fabric loop for holding a pen.  Elastic to hold planner closed or mark a page. Good size (6x8.5) for fitting in most purses, and easy to carry around.  Choice of black or orange cover, orange cover being easy to see/find.  Lots of options for planning different aspects of your life.

Cons:  Too much space given over to things to do/projects/goals/ideas at the expense of being able to use this is a functional daily/hourly planner.  When open, a double page measures 12 inches across x 8.5 inches high.  The space to plan your whole week is 9 inches wide x 4 inches high.  In that space, you are supposed to plan 7 days of hourly activity.  It's not enough.  I do have 20/20 vision, but the size/clarity/boldness of print is such that when this planner is open on my desk a couple of feet from me, I cannot see the print clearly enough to read the text of the days/times/dates, etc.  This is a fatal flaw in an otherwise appealing planner, and I had to order something different to replace it.",2.0
I returned this product because it just wasn't what I was looking for. Didn't seem as described.,2.0

I would have prefer that the ""week"" be 4 pages instead of two and instead of vertical like Franklin Covey; horizontal like Daytimer.  The goals in the front don't really work with the rest of the planner and so the ""instructions"", ostensibly telling you how to use this thing, are vague, it's sort of a wing and prayer i.e. get started & figure it out.  So, I am returning to Daytimer.  I write larger  even with my  Energel .38 Needlepoint Pen and after all, this, it is bulky to carry in your purse..",2.0
Too small.  Returned it.,2.0
This planner is good in a way that it has plenty of room to write out tasks  however i had NO ROOM to writeout my daily tasks it ended up being very unorganized and notes were allover the place and things weren't getting done... no offense...in addition it was too plain for me...sry was in a way excited thought it would help me organize my life and goals but did the very opposite...,2.0
"I like the design.  It's clean and simple, without the clutter motivational quote on every page like Franklin planner.  However, I will return the planner because:
1.  I like to use big and fat ballpoint pen but it won't fit in the pen loop.  I guess you can get away with a #2 pencil or something that size.  Why do I want to use a planner without my favorite pen attached to it?  I don't.
2.  The calendar has one-hour increments, just not enough for me.  I like to have at least half-hour increments.  The bad part is you don't get a full day for Sat and Sunday.  What made ActionDay to think that I don't plan Sat and Sunday like other days?

I will try this planner again if it's a loose leaf.  Why?  Because I can use my seven-ring binder that has two BIG pen loops, and I can insert my own calendar.",2.0
I don't like the layout. Too narrow to write in the columns.,2.0
"I like the concept, but the design is poor. I was using a blank spiral notebook to take care of my weekly meeting and to do lists and would create the structure myself. I wanted to try a planner with predefined boxes so I could write more per week. I chose this and I am not too happy with it. First, there is just so much unnecessary information and quotes at the beginning of the book -- maybe 25 pages. Print an insert or something instead Action Day! Onto the design itself. I think it's not great. Part of planners is that you have weekly goals and daily to do lists. This one has a single list to column for a week and then squeezes delegation and goals at the bottom. Saturday and Sunday take up one column, which makes no sense since a single column is for an entire day for block planning (8-11pm). How about making a daily to do block under each day and then having delegation and goals in their own column? It makes no sense. Definitely not worth $20. Only thing I can say is that it looks nice.",2.0
"Things I Like: This planner has some cool goal-oriented pages and lots of notes pages.  There is space for weekly tasks, projects, and delegation.  I like that it lays flat and can be flipped all the way open.  I like the time slots provided for each day of the week-at-a-glance agenda.  It's sleek, more professional looking than most other academic calendars, which is nice for internship appointments with clients.

Things I Dislike: The monthly calendar pages are so small, it's hard to write more than one or two short words on a day (and I wrote pretty small); so definitely NOT for a person with medium/large writing or for someone who has multiple obligations/appointments on a given day.  I also dislike that the monthly pages are separate from the weekly agenda.  I have to keep a post-it tab for the monthly section to get a month-at-a-glance view.  The days in the week-at-a-glace calendar are also quite small; again, not made for someone that has 2 appointments/obligations during a given hour.  Too much space is given for other areas of the weekly agenda, and not enough for the meat of the week.  There are no tabs, so I had to create my own in order to quickly find my note pages.  There is an elastic that may be used to either keep the book closed or keep as a page-minder.  There is an elastic pen-loop that is WAY small and will fit nothing more than a standard, cheapie pen or pencil; which doesn't make sense if this planner is gears toward students that have lots of tasks.  My Pilot Frixion pen has to live in the spiral which prevents me from fully opening the planner.  Lastly, I strongly dislike the price!  I know planners can run much more expensive, but I don't think the price warrants the amount of issues I have with this thing.  I find myself continuing to look for a new one, but as I paid so much for this one, I'm trying to stick it out until I finish this one.",2.0
"Has good intention, with goals/projects/and timed daily sections. However quality of paper is poor. It is old/easily torn/book paper. Therefor pages are easily torn. If your an at desk person its great..but for the on-the-go individual im not impressed.",2.0
"I liked the convenient size and easy to work with spiral (bonus - it came with a pen and holder!), and I was looking for a breakdown in times in a daily/weekly view, with open space on adjacent pages to jot my own notes. This only 1/2 way satisfied my needs. Not enough free space on left page to write my own, and the end of day times were narrowed - the lines were printed close......perhaps this can be improved in future, Otherwise it was nice.",2.0
"I had to remove several pages from the back so that I could open this planner.  Still, it's not easy to open.  The pages are all crammed into the binding...",2.0
Wasn't what I expected. I was looking for something that allowed more writing space in the ruled sections. I've taken it with me to one planning meeting and gave up on it mid-meeting because the ruled areas are just too limited to facilitate project planning or brain storming sessions.,2.0
Not really what I wanted. Too small and cramped to be much use as a planner tool. Expensive for what it is. I'm actually looking for a day planner and they seem hard to come by.,2.0
"After reading all the positive reviews, I thought this might work well for me.. not so much. The weekly planner's space to write is small. The task list on the left is also way too small, wish I could write phone nbs, etc... all on one line. The Projects delegated this week and Goals/projects I am doing at work.. quite useless.. Basically, I use all those places with lines to write to do lists, which I have a ton of. I would have much rather they don't get into your business and just let you write to do's and checks when done and deadline dates... the whole first 7 pages explaining how you can better allocate your time and better time manage, I did not care for... they have no idea what my life is like, no need to have explanations Attitude, goals and actions... I would definitely not buy it again. Oh well.. it was expensive too!!",2.0
"First I will say that the size of this planner is perfect for me and the planner itself is made very well.  It also has a spot to keep a pen and has some blank pages at the end which I do like.  I thought this planner would really help me get organized and plan out my day but the layout could really use some work in my opinion.  You are given very small hour time slots from 7am - 8pm so if I wanted to write in more than one thing in an hr slot it's almost impossible.  Secondly, I guess they assume most people don't do anything on the weekends because Saturday and Sunday are split in the last column so you have 7am - 1pm on Saturday and 4pm - 8pm on Sunday.  Also, there is no place to write any general information for the day such as birthdays.  Exactly half of the left page is taken up by tasks to execute which really doesn't help me on a weekly basis, I'd rather see it day by day and part of the bottom left page and the entire bottom right page is for projects and goals for this weekI would've rather seen these features as part of each day rather than taking up the majority of the book.  I'm sure this layout works for many people (I bought this planner because of all the great reviews), but just think about exactly what you're looking for before you buy.",2.0

These are incredibly poorly made. In fact, a couple of the tabs left behind their clear adhesive tab while I was gently removing them from the backing. They are very poorly made, small and flimsy.

A lot of the tabs would not come of the backing paper cleanly and ended up tearing the lettered paper part of the tabs. Did the best I could to fix them as this is for my sons bible he uses in school daily.,2.0
tabs were too small wasn't what I expected,2.0
They're really flimsy. Wish I'd gotten stiffer ones. I didn't know these tabs would be like they are.,2.0
"Didn't see the ""mini""",2.0
The tabs are rather small. I would have liked them to be a bit bigger.,2.0
Ordered these with silver and gold strip.  Was sorry that they did not include tabs for 7 additional books that are included in the Catholic version of bible.  Should be marked Protestant or King James version or include extra tabs.,2.0
The tabs were to small for me to read I'm a senior and wear glasses so they would be ideal for someone with better vision. No one's problem but my own!,2.0
"tabs are too small and thin, fine prints but you get what you pay for not worth the money though. would not recommend",2.0
really too small  cannot use them,2.0
it doesn't say they are mini size but i couldn't return because i needed them for my sister's bible ugh,2.0
Very poorly printed - some tabs are hard to read even.  Pain to put on. I bought to add to a Bible I purchased for a someone who doesn't yet know the order so they will do.,2.0
"Way to small, the print is so very tiny. If you church is dark, this will not help you.",2.0
"I was expecting the Apocrypha to be included in the tabbing, but I had to make do without the proper tabs. There are books missing  (such as Sirach) that I have in my bible, but there are no tabs for.",2.0
"In the description of the item it didn't say whether it was for a certain religious bible. I had bought bible tabs 2 years ago and it didn't state that they were for a certain religious bible, however I had ordered the correct ones at that time.  this one I ordered is for a protestant bible. I needed one for a catholic bible. I didn't know I had the wrong set until I had already started.",2.0
Smaller than I thought that they were going to be.,2.0
I prefer a more detailed planner.,2.0
"I like the idea behind this planner and how it helps you set and achieve goals.  But it's just too small, especially if you're someone like me who is detailed oriented and gets a little long-winded with your thoughts.",2.0
"This planner is ok, just not for me.  I am an online calender person.  I love to set a reoccurring appointment them let the computer place it in my datebook day after day, month after month, year after year.",2.0
"I bought the calendar again because I liked it so much. I still think it is useful, but they messed up the day of the week in the monthly view section. The CEO apologized but their solution was pretty pathetic...a PDF file of the corrected dates that you could print out.",2.0
The tabs where small. That made it difficult to find what scriptures i want fast. Now it's harder to study my bible.,2.0
I made the mistake of not realizing there isn't a monthly view page. No room to wrote notes or thoughts-very limited space.  I wish I didn't write in it because I would have returned it.,2.0
"Everything I liked about this has been changed. Obviously to save money... And not mine. Ink density has been reduced to gray. Type font has been reduced so in some areas you almost need a magnifying glass to read. Column headings, size reduced, type small, background lightened, column separators, hard to delineate. The thing that WAS  good about this planner is everything you've changed. I won't be purchasing again.",2.0
"I have to agree with others complaints on the description. I had previously ordered mini ones by my mistake, so I thought. I ordered these thinking they were normal size. I was wrong again. It doesn't state they are mini's and I mean tiny small. I also have a larger print bible and it is too difficult to use these tabs. I will try to offer them to someone else, but frankly I don't know who could read these. They are very nice, but if the description had said ""mini"" I would NOT have bought them.",2.0
"Unlike previous year versions, the printed text is too light and harder to see. Also, mine for some reason has two paper color, see attached image. Poor quality control...!
I used Action Day planner since 2013. I loved the planner concepts and layout.",2.0
"I loved loved this planner.. in 2016. The new planner, as far as I can tell, made one and only one change and it's made it much worse in my opinion. The lines which where much more faint in the 2016 version, are now solid and thick- which I'm not a big fan of- I'm looking for another planner",2.0
The font is too small... could hardly read any of its sections without squinting or using a magnifying glass,2.0
"The concept of this planner is really great, which is why I purchased multiple planners! But when I received them, they were all different, and I was very disappointed. Two were Spiral bound, while the other was hard bound, like a book. The hard binding is MUCH better, as the Spiral binding gets stuck easily. One Spiral and the hard bound planner each have a cool ""pocket"" in the back, but one Spiral bound book had no pocket. Last, two of the planners had a loop to hold a pen, and they were the hard bound book and the Spiral bound book with no pocket, but the loop on one book broke by the third use. I just found it very odd that I ordered three books, all of which came with different features than the others, and I had a difficult time giving them to their intended recipients because they weren't the same. I wish I had three hard bound planners with pockets and a pen holder that were the three colors offered, and I would be very happy with this purchase because the inside setup is fantastic!",2.0
This planner is nothing like I expected. It is too detailed and confusing with very little space to write information in. I am disappointed in this purchase.,2.0
It doesn't make it clear that it ends in June 2016,2.0
Its a tiny planner. And its just for keeping track of weight or progress.,2.0
"not even space to make the types of notes you would need to make. If you are in Uni or College, I would not recommend it. too basic.",2.0
"You can get eh same layout online for free. I am big on organization and rely on my planner for school, I figured for $20 it would have an innovative layout. The quality of paper and binding is great but there is a bunch of extra junk pages you don't need. If you are looking for a compact planner, look for something else.",2.0
"Details: Academic calendar running from July to July. Inspirational advice/tips at the front for those who want it.  A few pages of monthly calendars and then each double page shows a weekly schedule.  At the back, many blank pages for notes and a yearly calendar detailing notable dates. Rest of planner: Left hand page: half is a column of things to do, then 2/3 of remaining half is hourly space for Monday/Tuesday. Lower third of remaining half is for delegating teamwork and projects.  Right hand page: top 2/3 is Wednesday - Friday hourly planner and last column shared for Saturday/Sunday.  Bottom 1/3 of right page: place to note your projects/goals/achievements for the week.

Pros: Sturdy construction, good quality cover and paper.  Fabric loop for holding a pen.  Elastic to hold planner closed or mark a page. Good size (6x8.5) for fitting in most purses, and easy to carry around.  Choice of black or orange cover, orange cover being easy to see/find.  Lots of options for planning different aspects of your life.

Cons:  Too much space given over to things to do/projects/goals/ideas at the expense of being able to use this is a functional daily/hourly planner.  When open, a double page measures 12 inches across x 8.5 inches high.  The space to plan your whole week is 9 inches wide x 4 inches high.  In that space, you are supposed to plan 7 days of hourly activity.  It's not enough.  I do have 20/20 vision, but the size/clarity/boldness of print is such that when this planner is open on my desk a couple of feet from me, I cannot see the print clearly enough to read the text of the days/times/dates, etc.  This is a fatal flaw in an otherwise appealing planner, and I had to order something different to replace it.",2.0
"The elastic is stretched out, so a regular sized pen or pencil falls through. Also the elastic that would go around the whole book is stretched out and hangs funny, vs. being tight enough to hug the book when not in use. =(",2.0
Too small.  Returned it.,2.0
This planner is good in a way that it has plenty of room to write out tasks  however i had NO ROOM to writeout my daily tasks it ended up being very unorganized and notes were allover the place and things weren't getting done... no offense...in addition it was too plain for me...sry was in a way excited thought it would help me organize my life and goals but did the very opposite...,2.0
"I like the design.  It's clean and simple, without the clutter motivational quote on every page like Franklin planner.  However, I will return the planner because:
1.  I like to use big and fat ballpoint pen but it won't fit in the pen loop.  I guess you can get away with a #2 pencil or something that size.  Why do I want to use a planner without my favorite pen attached to it?  I don't.
2.  The calendar has one-hour increments, just not enough for me.  I like to have at least half-hour increments.  The bad part is you don't get a full day for Sat and Sunday.  What made ActionDay to think that I don't plan Sat and Sunday like other days?

I will try this planner again if it's a loose leaf.  Why?  Because I can use my seven-ring binder that has two BIG pen loops, and I can insert my own calendar.",2.0
"Things I Like: This planner has some cool goal-oriented pages and lots of notes pages.  There is space for weekly tasks, projects, and delegation.  I like that it lays flat and can be flipped all the way open.  I like the time slots provided for each day of the week-at-a-glance agenda.  It's sleek, more professional looking than most other academic calendars, which is nice for internship appointments with clients.

Things I Dislike: The monthly calendar pages are so small, it's hard to write more than one or two short words on a day (and I wrote pretty small); so definitely NOT for a person with medium/large writing or for someone who has multiple obligations/appointments on a given day.  I also dislike that the monthly pages are separate from the weekly agenda.  I have to keep a post-it tab for the monthly section to get a month-at-a-glance view.  The days in the week-at-a-glace calendar are also quite small; again, not made for someone that has 2 appointments/obligations during a given hour.  Too much space is given for other areas of the weekly agenda, and not enough for the meat of the week.  There are no tabs, so I had to create my own in order to quickly find my note pages.  There is an elastic that may be used to either keep the book closed or keep as a page-minder.  There is an elastic pen-loop that is WAY small and will fit nothing more than a standard, cheapie pen or pencil; which doesn't make sense if this planner is gears toward students that have lots of tasks.  My Pilot Frixion pen has to live in the spiral which prevents me from fully opening the planner.  Lastly, I strongly dislike the price!  I know planners can run much more expensive, but I don't think the price warrants the amount of issues I have with this thing.  I find myself continuing to look for a new one, but as I paid so much for this one, I'm trying to stick it out until I finish this one.",2.0
"I had to remove several pages from the back so that I could open this planner.  Still, it's not easy to open.  The pages are all crammed into the binding...",2.0
"These are all covers of the originals, which is to be expected. They are slow, as noted. What isn't noted is that they completely fail to swing. My wife (a grade 3/4 teacher) just got this CD and we're very disappointed. Her class will think it's the squarest thing they've ever heard and they'll be right.",2.0
"All Time Favorite Dances has all the dance instructions I needed, but the music is bland and lacks the charm of the original recordings.",2.0
"Although I love it and found it to be more useful than I had expected when it would not turn on or activiate after two months of use I felt lost, ripped off and up a creek with out a paddle.  Would 3com upgrade to the  latest model - NO WAY !  Did it take 10 minutes to speak to someone in  customer service - count on it.  It may be too early for this technology to  last and $300 plus for a 2 month day planner will hurt you just like it did  me !  You have been warned !",2.0
"Im a fan of Cross Pens, and have several, but this particular pen is defective.  It dispenses ink inconsistently, but usually not.  Im seeing it back for repair, so with shipping, Ill have spent considerably more for the pen than I had anticipated.  Ill chalk it up to the 1% defective the makes it past QA/QC.",2.0
"Poor quality for the price.  For a pen that sells for $75-100 you would expect great craftsmanship, but that is just not the case.  The common issue with these Chinese Century II's is that the grip is usually ""out of round"" meaning not flush with the rest of the pen.  You feel it with your fingers and it's a really annoying sharp edge.  The glue that holds the grip is poor quality and pretty much always breaks after a few months letting the plastic grip section spin - a very cheap feeling.  The cap also wears out over time and eventually becomes very loose.  All these issues are not that big of a deal if the pen cost $20, because it is a really nice pen, but for the amount of money I would look elsewhere.  I have been a long time pen collector and I am really disappointed about the drop in quality of Cross products since they went to China.  Their customer service is pretty poor too recently.  I have contacted them by email many times and they rarely respond or just tell you to mail the product in.  They have a lifetime warranty, but before you can even mail the pen in you have to pay a $10 processing fee and shipping.  So you are paying $20 just for them to look at it.  Other pens from different brands in this price range there is no cost for warranty repair and they usually prepay a shipping label for you.  I send in a Century II rollerball pen recently to Cross repair service because the cap became very loose.  They replaced the pen and it cost me $25.  The pen they sent back had the cap issue resolved but the grip was terribly misaligned and it was spinning loosely compared with the rest of the pen.  I emailed them many times about it and received no response.  Don't let the lifetime warranty fool you, not all warranties are the same.  If you can find this pen for $30, like you sometimes can, then it's a nice pen for the price, but I would never spend more than that on it.  In the past Cross pens were known for their quality and durability so this saddens me as Cross was my favorite pen brand.  I really hope they improve their customer service and quality.",2.0
"Received this pen on July 11th, 2017.
Used it lightly. Writes well, I like its balance, in fact, I bought two more!
They had discounted the price, received the latest pens on 8/18/17, that's when I noticed that the July 11th pen had what appeared to be scratches and a couple of spots where the lacquer seems to have disappeared, it would appear that the very act of putting the cap over the end of the pen caused that, bear in mind I've only used it a few times, and even then I didn't put the cap on there every time, I am very disappointed, especially since I just bought two more pens.
I won't be buying any more.",2.0
"This pen is not as I'd expected......I'd thought I was buying a replacement for my lost and much missed heftier Cross ballpoint pen, which I now understand was the 'Townsend' family of Cross pens, and not this very similar looking Century II model. My mistake, but an easy mistake to make if you are not intimately familiar with the different Cross models that look so similar in photos, but are actually significantly different in length, weight, girth, etc.
  Be careful before you buy....and look at the Cross website to make sure you are ordering the model that you want.",2.0
"The feel and heft of this pen are wonderful. It feels great in the hand and would be nearly perfect if... the refills weren't severely limited. If you like a thin line, I suggest you look for another option.  There is no fine line (0.5 mm) rollerball option for this pen. There is a fine porous point option, which starts out great, but quickly disappointments. The point on the porous pen wears down quickly, so before it's out of ink, the point is receding into the metal cone and you have to stop writing before the refill is out of ink. I remember the Cross porous points from long ago (the driver for me to purchase this pen) but the newer versions are, I'm afraid, crap.

If you like a medium point rollerball, this a great pen, but if you prefer a finer point, keep looking.",2.0

"I like pens a lot, and have several, this one is really nice and good looking and is one of the nicest pen i have write with, its smooth on the writing, have great balance, to make this short is almost the perfect pen, BUT and is a big BUT, the clip to hook the pen to the shirt get loose and the pen no longer holds in place on the shirt its move around on your pocket.

I have to clean the nib 3 times daily to just keep it clean. Not very impressed with this particular pen. It looks great, just wish that it wrote better.",2.0
"This pen is my husband's all-time favorite. However, this is the 3rd one I've had to buy for him because after using it daily, the cap loosens, eventually not staying on at all, and the cartridge falls out. He says, after using this pen for YEARS, he'll never buy another one.",2.0

Pen and pencil are lighter, Ink doesn't flow as well as my bic pen for 20 cents, pencil mechanical are not as good as the original cross ones. It may not cost more than $2 to manufacture in china using disadvantaged workers, but they are still selling it for over $100 here in USA - capitalism and communism at their best.",2.0

"I have owned many Cross pens in my life and have always felt they were of excellent quality. I purchased this pen, the Cross Century II Medalist Ballpoint Pen, in November, 2011, and when it came time to replace the ink cartridge, I removed the cap portion, replaced the cartridge, and, upon replacing the cap, it no longer fit tightly and securely.  I felt that it could easily fall off and get lost.  I requested a replacement or refund and was told that because it had been longer than 60 days the Seller, Most Exciting Stuff, would do nothing about it.  So I contacted Cross directly and have sent it in for repair or replacement, however, I had to pay a $10 processing fee up front.  I feel that an item that is defective and is only 2-3 months old should be replaced free of charge.  It has been at least a month and I am still waiting for the pen to be returned to me.  I am disappointed in both Cross and Most Exciting Stuff, unless Cross ends up refunding the $10 fee once I get the pen back.

"I purchased the Cross Classic Century Black Lacquer Fountain Pen with Fine Nib (AT0086-77FS). This is by far the nicest feeling pen I have ever owned. I loved everything about how this pen felt with the slim design, clean black and chrome look, and the feeling of twisting on/off the cap. The only place that this pen lacked was in writing. This pen wrote like a bold pen no matter the paper you wrote on. I tried different inks, writing techniques, adjusting the tines, and even professional are paper all the way down to basic copy paper. This pen either wrote very bold or bled into the paper and left those spiderweb like streaks on the writing line as you wrote and when compared to a five dollar disposable fountain pen, I preferred the five dollar pen for how it wrote (seeing to how it's a pen and only purpose is to write). I tried contacting Cross customer support with no avail as to if there was something I was doing wrong with the ink, the amount of pressure I wrote with, or whatever the case may have been.
I tried very hard to like the pen and did as much research as I could on how i could fix my issues before finally returning it but just could not accept how it wrote in the end. Its to bad because the pen is the best feeling pen I've ever owned and I have to return it.

"I used to buy Cross pens as Christmas gifts to give my clients until they decided they did not want to hire Americans anymore .  Now all the pens I looked at as possible gifts are made in China.

So now I have the dilemma of what US made product to get my clients.

The quality is ok but I want to buy a made in America product,

If it is made in China I would expect them to drop the price, they did not because they think the brand is all that matters, Cross Corp. seems to be just another greedy management team so the price stayed the same.

Another typical US brand, Cut costs, fire American workers, move production overseas and pocket the savings.

Not worth the money.  At best it's just ok.,2.0
I had one of these for a long time and it was of better quality.  I have two main issues with this pen.  One being that it is not as heavy as the previous Cross pen I had.  If you are expecting to feel that nice solid weight in your writing hand this is not the pen for you.  My second complaint is that I feel that this pen is not of the same craftsmanship as my previous Cross Classic Century pen.  The twist mechanism is not not tight enough. What I mean by that is the bottom half of the pen wiggles when you turn it.  In my experience Cross Pens are usually solid.  Paying 20$ for a pen I expected a more sturdy product.  I wish I would have read some of the recent reviews because they all pretty much state the same thing.  Not the quality you expect for Cross.  Two stars because I don't hate it but I definitely don't like it.,2.0
"I generally am very pleased with Cross Pen/Pencil Products.  I've had this pen (the Cross Classic Century, Lustrous Chrome model) for just over 30 days (which negates the return per Amazon policy) and the inside thread has become dislodged or defective and thus the ballpoint cannot be screwed in which makes the pen useless.  I did try to insert a both refills that I also purchased and they would not work - so not a refill issue but rather the pen itself.  I am not sure if this is an aftermarket or made outside the USA pen, but it does feel somewhat light and inferior to other Cross Pens I have had in the past (not too far off one of the other reviews I read).  Perhaps the low price was an indication and I should have done a bit more diligence!  Regardless, the distributor was MegaPen so I would suggest you be cautious if ordering from them.",2.0

I didn't pay extra for this pen so I can work on it myself; I could've done that with a zebra for much cheaper!!",2.0

I'm hoping it was just a bad ink refill they included, but regardless they shipped a half working pen! aesthetically this pen does look pretty nice, it's lightweight but still feels like a metal pen. It is a thin pen, but that's more of a preference thing more than anything. my one major complaint (apart from the faulty ink) is that the small groves near the tip seem to constantly fill up with gunk just from normal writing. for it's price point I wouldn't recommend this pen, I'll stick with the Parker jotter for a cheap quality pen.",2.0
Not working that good. Kind of dry,2.0
Pen feels great in your hands but bleeds horribly when writing with it.  Very difficult to write in a standard notebook due to the boldness of the ink.  Tried with different cartridges but still doesn't help.,2.0
I like the cross pens very much & using since last so many years for personal & gifts use. Unfortunately this time with in a week it stated getting rust though it is an expensive 10 carat gold pen. So I returned. Before I never have such experience. I think it is quality problem & lake of testing the product. Finally I returned.,2.0

"I really wanted to like this pen.  It costed more than any of my other pens, but it seemed worth it because it was very slim and lightweight, and the cap screwed on, which made it perfect for someone who bicycles everywhere and needs to carry their pens in their pocket.  The first thing I noticed about this pen when I took it out of the packaging was how large the nib was.  When I wrote with it, the ink came out extremely thick, too thick for me to even write between college ruled lines without smudging it.  It didn't help that the ink took forever to dry, too.  This pen writes very smoothly, but the eventual product often turns out illegible.  I definitely want to try this pen again if I find one with a finer nib, but with the medium nib, this pen is not very useful.",2.0
not a great quality this pen is differnitely not strong,2.0
"Writes OK and all that stuff but what the heck.  Made in China??!!  Cross is crossed off my list of quality, classy pens.",2.0
"The pen itself appears to be well constructed and of good quality. The opening and closing operation are very smooth, and I do not get the sense that the pen was cheaply made as is suggested in some of the other reviews. The weight, feel, and grip are all great, and it looks great. However, it fails serve its primary purpose: it does not write! I have had it only a few days, and at first it was great. After signing a few documents it began to skip, and now it is hardly writing at all. In a way, it almost feels wrong to give the pen a bad review based on its bad ink refill, but as it is the original (and included) ink tube, I can't justify a higher star rating.

I'm going to have to buy a new refill and hope that fixes the problem.",2.0
"Not sure if they are genuine. I buy a lot of stuff through Amazon and usually they are what. You expect them to be. With my cross purchase, it's not the same.  I ordered for 2 different models and they all came in same/ similar box. The pens itself looked a bit flimsy. This was a gift so I could not return - moreover, Im not the ones to easily return stuff unless they are expensive ones.

"I bought this pen to use for a course I am taking. I was very disappointed. The twist action of the pen was not smooth at all. I compared it to one I bought back in the 1970's and it was a night and day experience. The weight of the pen is also a bit lighter. I compared it to my older chrome cross pen I gave t my son and indeed it felt lighter. Since Cross has moved their manufacturing overseas, it seems quality has taken something of a hit. I would like to add another Cross Pen to my desk, but I will have to think long an hard about ordering a new one. I have been a Cross Pen user on and off for the past 35 years and based on my experience with this particular pen it appears something has changed and not necessarily for the good.",2.0
"My husband wanted a silver set. His gold set that he has had for about 25 years were starting to show wear.  I ordered this set in January and it was disappointing from the start, but they worked until this week! The inside mechanism of the ink pen literally came apart! Now it doesn't work at all.
The pencil still works. Not the same craftsmanship of the older generation of Cross pens.",2.0

"The ink refill inside is only made for this genre of pen by Cross. The problem is Cross makes lousy ink refills and other superior refills cannot be used with this pen. I would love this pen not with gel ink, but with a ballpoint  refill.",2.0
"I rec'd a new Cross pen set, the black and gold models, as a gift.  Upon changing the refill to a fine point, the inner mechanism has malfunctioned and now will not hold any refill at all.  I phoned the Cross company in Rhode Is., and was told there is a TEN DOLLAR ""handling charge"" for fixing this almost-new pen.  How can this be?  A supposed Lifetime Guarantee does not come with a big hefty TEN DOLLAR charge.  I phoned back and asked to speak with a person in charge of customer relations at Cross, and I was told I would get a response.  It's been 3 weeks.....  My name is Cross, and we have used these pens for years. The threads inside the pen that hold the refill are made out of PLASTIC, the threads were made from brass back when these pens were made in the US, not in china.  They still have not e-mailed or called. Bad PR, cheaply made, spurious warranty.

"Just like other reviewers have said, this ain't what it used to be. NOT a quality feel anymore. Twist action is slightly gritty and not smooth at all. Super feather weight, reeks of cheapness. Top and bottom halves don't have a good fit together making for an ugly joint.
I had one of these back in the 80's and it was solid, smooth and balanced.... loved it! This one... not so much.
So sad to see a trusted brand that stood for quality, now producing cheap crap.",2.0
A bit too thin and short for writing. Especially if you have bigish hands like me.,2.0
I gave this as gift and I was disappointed to learn that it was not a pen and pencil set as advertised. The product was taped shut as if it was a return or used set.  Inside was two pens one without ink. Because I live overseas I do not want to deal with a return. Buyer beware that you may not get what you purchase!,2.0
"I would like this pen more if it were slightly larger and had an in chromed section. At the moment it is entirely too small to write any more than a check's worth of info, and the chrome grip makes it as hardhard to hold as a pen made of ice. The pen wouldbe worth the price if not for its total lack of converter. Not only is this pen too small for even the smallest converters, Cross stated that they have no intention of making one up. Also, good luck finding cartridges when the slim size isn't sold locally.

If you want a novelty sized fountain pen without the novelty ink or price then this is for you.",2.0
One is set up to be either a pen or pencil by swapping out the inside mechanisms. Can't tell which is a pen or pencil anymore as previously the 0.5 mm pencil had solid gold indication on top while the pen has a black circle on top to tell the difference. Bring back the original 0.5 mm pencil!,2.0
"I really wanted to like this pen, I love the slim design. But its ink flow is just bad. It worked fine for the first few days, then it has become a constant struggle to get the ink to flow consistently. Sometimes it takes minutes of drawing circles and shaking the pen to get the ink flowing at all; then it'll write for awhile but then start to get patchy so the writing looks increasingly scratchy.

I give up: No more Cross fountain pens for me, they just don't work.",2.0
"Much cheaper feel than the old ones.  As others have noted, doesn't look any different than the matching pen so can't tell what you are taking out of your shirt pocket.  Too bad as I had Cross pens and pencils for years.  Wouldn't buy again.",2.0
"Made in China. Not the same quality as US made Cross pens. I would rather pay more, but companies are convinced they must sell for the lowest possible price. Would you pay 10 to 15% more for a relatively low priced item that was marketed as being made in the USA? I do wonder how much excessive regulation and taxation has to do with it.",2.0
This item was marked as a 7mm Pencil it is actually a 7mm with a 5mm insert,2.0
"For $40, I expected something better than a glorified felt tip pen. There's really only two settings on this thing: not writing and spewing ink. Ink frequently bleeds through onto a following page and always makes using both sides of a page impossible. There's absolutely no style possible with how much ink comes out from the tip.

Even more annoying, however, is that when closed, the base frequently comes unscrewed instead of the tip, forcing me to grasp the little lip of metal and ink cartridge in order to unscrew the cap and screw back on the base, which is a pain when you have to leave the cap on in order to keep the tip from drying out.

Just spend more money and get a better pen.",2.0
"Sorry but I am not impressed at all with the build quality of this pen as it arrived in June 2014.

I love the product design of this pen although the photos do make it look significantly bigger than it actually is but thats not an issue. The real issue is mass-market (offshore) manufacturing that makes the great design feel only mediocre in hand. The pen I received was packed ok but I just could not open it! Cross comes with screw cap and the ink barrel too screws on. It took me quite some time to first unscrew the ink barrel and then using a small vise to hold on to the small pen part to unscrew the cap. Ideally, they should have not sent it fastened. Anyway, even now after using it for a few days, I am not really super happy with the purchase, writing quality, or the way the pen feels in hand. I wish they still made it with the old higher quality manufacturing process. Thinking of returning.",2.0
"I had one for years that was so beautiful.  I lost it and tried to replace it.  Well, the new ones all have a pocket holder and the gold is very brassy looking and splotchy.  I returned it.",2.0
I bought this for my husband for Valentines day and while I like it I was very disappointed that it isn't a pen and pencil set. It's a pen set with a pencil conversion thing.  The pencil conversion was crap though so my husband just has two pens.  The pens are good quality and he enjoys them so if you want two pens it's great!,2.0
"I was disappointed that the pencil I ordered turned out to be a ball point case converted into a pencil. I used to be able to tell the pen from the pencil by the black dot on the top of the pen. Now both have the dot, and exactly the same configuration, so I can't tell them apart unless I crank out the tip. This doesn't affect the quality of the writing, but it adds an inconvenience to the use.",2.0
"I can't stand the lead feed on this pencil. You have to remove the cap, twist it, press the end to push out some lead, turn it back, replace the cap and then twist the cap EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO EXTEND THE LEAD. So inconvenient and it doesn't work perfectly, it takes fiddling with to get it to work right. Guess it is back to the drawing board to find a pencil that feeds in a simple, usable way.",2.0
Made in China.... I bought this as a gift thinking the quality would be Made in USA....but unfortunately it is a Made in China product which doesn't give the feeling of the one I had before which was made in USA,2.0
"This pen is not well made. I have many cross pens from decades ago so I decided to refresh and buy a new one. But when I compare them to this one, it is quite clear how cheap this pen is. First, this pen is lighter. To some this may be great, but to me not so much. Second, the mechanism that holds the ink is wobbly inside the pen. When retracted the tip will be pushed in a little every time you push down. When detracted the two parts of the pen are not securely positioned. The pen will then be able to wobble or wiggle at the middle point. The middle point will show that the pen is not completely pushed together and there is really nothing you can do about it unless you replace the entire inner mechanism and refit it. Third, made in China. The refills are also made in China. The ink blots and is shown lighter and worse than the disposable Bic pen I used for comparison. It is not worth the $45~ I paid. I would not even pay $5 for this junk.",2.0
Purchased this pen set and sent it back. The new pencil design uses the same pen but now has an insert to convert it to a pencil. When you grab the pen you don't know if you have the pen or pencil. The pencil insert allows the pencil to retract when you start writing. Definitely not the same quality as the old ones made in the USA.,2.0
"I have my originl Cross pen and pencil, both made in the USA. The newer ones are made in Asia and are of inferior.quality.",2.0
"If these are really Cross pens, they are not up to the standard I remember for Cross.  I have used cross pens since the sixties... But the last set I bought was 15 years or more ago.  This gold set fells like plastic... Not really a nice gold color

"Cross is cheapening its products.  This pencil was redesigned in order to use the same barrels as for its pens.  Unfortunately, in order to do so, Cross had to design it with a retractable inner point that is clumsy and can be easily broken off.  Also, the lead does not stay locked in position the first time it is extended; it pushes right back into the tip, and I have to crank it out a second time in order for it to stay in position and  be useable.",2.0

"I intended to purchase these items for two teachers of my daughter as a Christmas gift. After opening the box, I embarrassed to give it to them. I asked myself this is an authentic ""Cross"" pen.

My eldest sister used to give me one set of Cross pen and pencil after my graduation for the past 20 years.  Until now, they are still nice in the box and my memory.",2.0
"Let me just say I am incredibly loyal to the Cross name as well as Amazon.  Unfortunately, this timeless pen has degraded in quality ever since they moved production to China.  Like many, I ignored the negative reviews, but you should trust them.  Perhaps I received a knockoff or a bad batch (bought from Trend Marketing), but the gold is spotted and the clip seems almost a bit rusty, which is unacceptable.  This will be returned and bought from the cross website.",2.0
"Bought five sets to give as gifts and am a little disappointed.  The pens / pencils kind of look cheap and the quality of the packaging is not what it used to be, even a few years ago.

It came a day earlier than the expected day. I was very happy and when i cut open the box the pen is in looked fabulous. I was very excited. I opened the box took out the pen thats when my rating went down. The pen was not what I was expecting. The top is very shaky and it feels like it is just going to break apart soon. I would say if you are going to buy a cross pen you should just save your money and buy a better one.,2.0
"What?  That doesn't make any sense!  Isn't this a pencil?

The Century model was once available as an actual pencil, with a simple twisting advancing mechanism and a writing tip sized just right for the lead to go through.  Removing the cap and eraser, you had a very large storage area.  You could fit a dozen extra leads in it and write all week without needing to carry a separate box of leads.

Now the ""pencil"" is actually the pen model with a pencil converter inside.  This is lame for several reasons:

1. At the front end, you get an extra tube sticking through the large ballpoint opening with a smaller hole for the lead to come out, which looks much less elegant than the old pencil.  Yes, it's just looks, but you are paying for that.

2. On the inside, the pencil mechanism is a very skinny device no larger than the ballpoint refill (the ""pencil"" essentially contains 2 mechanisms, the ballpoint AND the pencil converter inside of that, leaving little room for storage).  You can fit 3 extra leads in, but then it gets crowded.  Also, though you physically ""twist"" the cap 1/4 turn to advance the lead, it is really operating as one of those complex clickie mechanisms which eventually start to slip.

3. Cross doesn't even bother to make the caps different any more.  In the old days, the black top hat of the pen had a little metal dot on it, and the pencil was just black.  That way you could tell if you were grabbing the pen or pencil out of your cup full of pens.  Now they are both the same (strangely, both WITH the added dot), and you will grab the wrong one 50% of the time.

4. The eraser is much smaller.  With the old pencil mechanism being as wide as the pencil body, the eraser plug was as large as could fit inside it making it almost as large as a normal pencil eraser.  The new one, having to plug into a converter fitted inside a ballpoint-size mechanism, is about half that size.  Not only does it wear down faster, but using a stupid skinny little eraser makes the erasing process take longer.

5. And finally... Cross has switched some of the internal parts to plastic, instead of metal.  It was never an extremely heavy pencil, but it had just enough weight to feel good while writing.  Now it kind of feels cheap.

The only good thing about this new system is that after you get tired of the crummy little eraser and small lead capacity (or after the click mechanism breaks), you can just remove this stupid adapter and replace it with a ballpoint refill.",2.0
"cheap pen (<$20) but should really be about $5!  pretty nasty feel to it, and the twist mechanism is really poor also.  There's nothing particularly positive to say about this, other than it's inexpensive to purchase!  I would personally not buy this again, and opt for a Parker pen or something else.",2.0
"My wifey to be got me one last year for my birthday...it was one of the new ones manufactured in China.  I have several older USA pens to compare it to.  The build quality was notably lower than the older American pens.  The gap in the middle of the pen was a bit wider, and the 2 sections of barrel did not meet up as cleanly.  The pen also didn't feel quite as dense in the hand.  The pen did come in an attractive box with securing bands however which was rather nice.
It is not a bad pen, but the luxurious feel is all gone.  That feel is half of what I pay for with these things, and as a result, I will be switching to Parker pen products from here on out.
UPDATE: the pen self-destructed in my hand about 2 months after this review...bringing it down to 2 stars.  Just stumbled upon a gold-filled Cross from the 70's and it reminded me of just how far these things have fallen.",2.0
"I bought this after reading the other 4 reviews that gave this pen 5 stars!

The build quality is so china like, the upper and lower peaces of the pen are not aligned like it should .. you can never expect such horrible problem with such a highly priced product..

Other than that it writes smoothly and came with a nice gift box..",2.0
"Deciding to replace the Cross Classic Century ballpoint pen I received as a gift many years ago (and in the intervening years managed to lose), I began a careful search for information in the form of reviews for the pen.  What I read actually led to my having reservations concerning this thought of a replacement purchase; what little information I could find was not...encouraging.
I did finally decide, however, to replace the memory of this Cross pen given to me in 1967 and having done so, I have found the quality to be what I  honestly expected based on all my reading, but a bit less than I had hoped for (eternal optimist that I am).  Through months of use now I am comfortable with the following observations:

  -The manufacturers stamping on the top of the rear tube is clean, clear, and precise - (meaningless, but a nice detail).
  -The join of the tip to the front tube is very nearly perfect.
  -The fit of the rear tube to the front never seems quite right, always leaving a bit of the rear tube lip easily discernible by touch, and is sometimes quite obvious visibly.
  -I have been more than impressed with the functioning of the pen's twist mechanism as it shown no signs of play while smoothly opening and clos-ing the pen.
  -I have decided not to use the clip (relegating this pen to my desk forever) as it seems...weak; not well connected to rear tube and a pen falling from a pocket is always disconcerting.
  -It does seem to collect what most call micro scratches quite readily which does distract from the overall finish of the pen.

I would gladly overlook any, or all of these things had I not experienced such difficulty  with the diameter of the pen...at 0.3 inches I find the pen extremely  narrow and  difficult to hold correctly (very much the opposite of the Lamy Pico and something I had no memory of).  This discomfort does preclude, in fairness, any remarks on quality of writing - if I am not able to hold the pen correctly then I am obviously not able to write well with it.  The length, at nearly 5.25 inches, seems just about right as I hold the pen  and aesthetically the ratio of length to width makes this a remarkably beautiful pen.
All in all I am glad that I decided to purchase it and I do use it often, even though the uncomfortably narrow width and the fit/finish flaws might suggest otherwise.",2.0
"i ordered this product a few months ago, and the pen and pencil are great, however the eraser refills are hard to find in stores (in fact im still looking), when i was looking for the erasers at office depot i noticed what appears to be the same pen pencil set for 20 dollars cheaper.",2.0
"Cross stopped making the .5mm pencil, which I loved. I could fill it with 15-20 leads, and would be set to go for a long time. Now they only make the .7mm pencil, which comes with an expensive $8 lead holding tube, that only holds 3 leads, before needing to be replaced.  I can replace the 3 leads without buying a replacement tube, but getting the pencil to operate properly again is a time consuming endeavor.  If you don't put it back together just right, the tip of the pencil keeps slipping back into the pencil body, so that no lead is exposed for writing.

When I saw this add on Amazon for the .5mm pen and pencil set, I was willing to pay for the whole set, even though I don't need the pen.  Instead, they sent me the .7mm pencil, which is a pain to use. Even though I am unhappy with the pencil I received, I will not be sending it back, as it is still better to write with than the cheaper pencils found in most drug store.  I just wish Cross had not discontinued the .5mm pencil",2.0

"I don't know anything about gold, so maybe this is typical, or maybe it is some kind of discoloration.

Whatever the cause, every time I see the 14 karat version of this pen in a store, it looks halfway like copper.  You can see some difference on the Cross website, although their stock image actually looks better than the real thing.

Both the higher-content 18 karat pens AND the lower 10 karat models look more like gold.  If you want a ""gold"" pen, I would save some money and get the cheaper 10 karat model.  It's a little paler than the 18 karat, but it still looks like gold.",2.0

It has a satin chrome look rather than shiny chrome look, which could be ok I guess, but it just somehow looks cheap.  Personally I love the Century Medallion or Century Black with Chrome touches.  Rather than return this one I'll keep it for use as a backup, give the price.  Caveat Emptor.",2.0
"The price was right but this is the Cross pen made in China and it is a big disappointment.  The pen looks great but it makes ink blotches as I write.  If you are using it just to sign you name maybe it is okay.  However, to do more serious writing don't buy this pen.  Holdout for one of the older Cross pens made in the USA.  It is a pity A.T.

"I wanted a nice pen/pencil set and I was somewhat disappointed with this one.

Pros:  Looks very nice

Cons: This pen and pencil set is very small in diameter and somewhat difficult to hold an and write with.  The writing quality of the ballpoint is ""blotchy"" and equivalent to a 59 cent bic.  I expect more for a so called ""fine writing"" instrument set",2.0

"Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say ""USA"" near the top, and they are great pens.

The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their ""lifetime guarantee,"" only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a ""handling fee"" attached.

I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect.

"This is my first digital answering machine after my trusty analog (i.e., cassette-based) Panasonic machine finally died. I don't like it very much, and I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I think most digital answering machines have similar problems.

Mainly, the voice quality stinks -- and I don't mean the computer-generated voice (although that's also very hard to understand), but the recording quality is just awful, making any message coming from a cell phone VERY hard to understand. I don't need 40 minutes of poor quality messages, I would much rather have 20 minutes of much better quality sound.

Not only that, but the ""user interface"" is awful. It's very confusing when a message that you deleted all of a sudden becomes ""undeleted"" and is there in the queue of messages to be played. And if you skip to the last message and then accidentally skip forward once more, you now have to go through ALL of the messages again -- it would've been nice if skipping back one message from the first message would put you at the last message.

I also wish that I didn't have to hear my outgoing message every single time someone is leaving a message.

I'm probably going to try and fix my good old cassette-based answering machine, while I try to find another digital answering machine that has better recording quality.",2.0
IT WAS NOT WHAT MY GRANDSON THOUGHT IT WAS.  HE COULD NOT USE IT.,2.0
"I got tired of the tapes wearing out of my old answering machine, but this answering machine after a few months' use, would cut off my greeting and disconnect, making people have to call two or three times.

I think I'll stick to the tape machines.  Mine was reliable as long as the tape lasted.",2.0
"In terms of features & price, this answering machine is one of the best deals you can get. With 4 separate mailboxes and 40 minutes of digital recording time, what's not to love, right? Well, after less than a year of use, the answering machine no longer answers incoming calls. After 4 rings, the outgoing message begins to play from the speaker, but the answering machine never picks up! It took my wife and I several days of not getting any messages to figure this out. Who knows how many important messages we missed because of this? Very infuriating.
We have since replaced the answering machine with a Sprint SP-812 that we picked up used from Craigslist.org for $10. The SP-812 only has 1 mailbox and 12 minutes of recording time, but at least it reliably answers the phone... and that's the most important feature of all.",2.0
"Not many of these separate answering machines around. After reading the various reviews, decided to purchase this machine. The features are great.  It was easy to program, and loved the four separate mailboxes. Outgoing message (you can program two different ones) was clear when calling in, and incoming messages also quite easy to understand. Good volume control. Very easy to set up for use.  One unusual feature is the line cord to the wall jack; it's fixed to the machine, and it's pretty short. Would prefer a removable cord. Anyway, seems great, huh? Well, after only a couple of weeks, it's broken! Calls come in, and machine picks up, but caller can't hear the outgoing message, nor can leave a message.  Tried all the fixes in ""troubleshooting,"" none worked; tried all new cords, everything we could think of. Look somewhere else - poor quality control/reliablity, and it doesn't even have any moving parts! Have an older GE with tape (switched for the extra mailboxes), about 7 years old, still works great! Progress??",2.0
"I've been through two of these things in about 6 months. You'd think I'd learn, but I'm always in a rush, and it was the only one I could find with 40 min record time. The backup battery often failed, it often cut off my callers, then twice, it outright died and I'd have to buy a new one. When it worked, it did work pretty well and has a lot of features for the money. But this time, I think I have to go AT + T.",2.0
"I see a lot of good reviews here.  I must admit that the answering machine has a very good interface.  The problem is that a few months after I bought it the speaker started making this crackling sound.  It sits on a desk where we're working and it's very annoying to listen to this continuous random crackling noise.  It was inexpensive, so I just bought another one.  A few months later, the new one started doing the same thing!  I assume there was some sort of manufacturing defect.  I just can't figure out why I don't see anyone else mentioning this problem.  Maybe this issue has been fixed by now, but let this be a warning that yours may do this too.",2.0

You need an A-to-B connector. I discovered this by  purchasing the only USB connector at my local electronics store, which was  an A-to-A. Since I'm new to USB, it would be handy if the Epson booklet  said something about this under ""USB"" in the index. It does  not.
Before even getting to the point where the instructions said to  connect it to the computer, the printer barfed out on the  ""cleaning"" process. I followed the instructions carefully.

"I bought the memorex CD LabelMaker Deluxe Kit, CD labels included, and  after experimenting with the program for awhile I was able to print labels.  You are pretty much on your own when it comes to figuring it out but if you  aren't a newbie you will be able to. One problem with the program is that  once I had selected my photo and text to put on the label, it freezes and I  had to shut down the computer and restart. It happened twice while I was  figuring out how to use it. Another problem is that I use pictures to put  on my CD labels and the paper quality for the CD labels is very poor. You  have to use a blank label first to keep the text that is already written on  the CD from bleeding through and then put your label with your photo or  what information you have on it on top of the blank label. So if you order  100 labels 50 is going to be wasted to stop the text on the CD from  bleeding through so you actually get to use only 50 of the 100 labels. They  should use photo quality paper for the labels and they don't so if you put  pictures on the labels they are not going to be as good as they could be.  (Memorex give us photo quality paper for the CD labels please !!!!) I'm  willing to pay extra for it to get a better picture. After you get pass all  of this you are ok. The LabelMaker gadget works just fine and puts the CD  labels on so that it looks professional.",2.0
"These are excellent labels, at an equally excellent price...But,  WHY do they fold the sheet in half to fit it into the box!  Only after VERY CAREFULLY unfolding the individual sheets, and ""unbending"" the  several creases, folds and ""curly-cues"" are you able to put them  through your laser printer.  THEN, I would say that approximately 1/3 of  them get jammed in the works, ruining one or both labels that come on a  sheet.  Furthermore, with my printer I have to disassemble my equipment in  order to fish out the crumpled labels sheet.",2.0

Also, the buttons always get mashed when it sits in your suit jacket  so that the battery gets wasted.

Of course, this was what I was trying to avoid in the first place.",2.0
"Toner appears to be genuine.  Was in HP packaging and has HP logos.  However, all prints have 3-4 horizontal lines on them.

Have cleaned the drum roller as much as I can to no avail.  Cartridge is essentially worthless.  Will only use it for in-house prints, where I don't care about the lines.

Enough of box seal was unbroken so product could not fall out, so we opened it up fully. Plastic packaging had not been broken through. Installed toner and it works fine. Concerned it may not be original and may not last as long as it is supposed to. Will keep it but will probably order from someone else next time. If a product box is damaged and stained, seller should be clear about that so there are no concerns for customer receiving what they believe to be a new and unused product.",2.0
"When the SuperDeal shipment arrived the box was 30% crushed from inadaquate bubble wrap packaging inside.  The inner box of toner had been crushed on one corner but appeared generally intact.  However it was of an older vintage HP Packaging and not the HP box  currenly pictured on SuperDeal's Amazon page.

I installed the cartridge and it worked in my 5P printer. BUT WAIT!  ...over the next few weeks it printed fine for an overall total of no more than 6-8 pages.  Then, perhaps six weeks after being installed, the printer sounded a loud ""electrical shorting like sound"" and printed a SOLID BLACK page!  This happened sequentially 4 times as I attempted to trouble shoot the problem.  Then I headed out to a local office supply store and purchased a C3903A HP Print Cartridge for $25 more than I paid SuperDeal for its product.  The new cartridge restored my Laserjet 5P to its original quality operation and I breathed a sigh of relief that the printer was not damaged by the SuperDeal HP Cartridge.

Then, I proceeded to write an ""update"" to my original product feedback (see below the Original) which Amazon apparently decided not to post as I cannot find that revision.  So here I am making another try:  I contacted SuperDeal by email and shared my experience with what they had sent me.  I asked for either a replacement cartridge or a refund.  The next day I had SuperDeal's response appologizing for the Cartridge failure and promising to send a replacement cartridge immediately.  10 days later the cartidge arrived.  It was Well packed this time; it had a ""current"" HP Retail Packaging this time; it had no box stains this time.  So BE CAREFUL!  This vendor seems to have both old HP cartridges (out of date?)and ""current"" HP Retail product.  What you end up getting appears to be the luck of the draw; or perhaps you get new product when the original blows up in your printer!  Lesson Learned on this end. Posted 12/1/2010

Original Review:
Heads up! Yet again I have foolishly ordered an item from Amazon which they show as ""In Stock"" but really do not have.
After placing the order and a few days interval, I get an email from Amazon saying it has shipped. Then the same day I get and email from Amazon CONFIRMING A FULL CREDIT REFUND to my credit card. The ""EXPLANATION FIELD reads ""Order Cancelled"" That's a fact, NOT an explanation! I then send an email (via Amazon) to their vendor, Quantum Electronics, asking for a ""real explanation"". I must say: Good for Quantum Electronics! They responded the next day saying that the cancellation was Amazon's doing because ""the product you ordered was oversold by Amazon"". Now that's an explanation, of sorts.

To Quote Amazon: ""We're Building Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company"" Hubris. (Try and find the link to email customer service on the Amazon site. There is one, but Good Luck finding it! I get especially irked when Amazon shows products ""In Stock"" and that statement proves NOT TRUE! :-( ***End of Rant***

Now, all that said: I remain an Amazon customer since I highly value THE SERVICE THEY PROVIDE VIA the ""Customer Reviews"" on products which reviews can also extend Amazon's ""service"", or lack of service, such as in this review here. Most of the time Amazon DOES DELIVER as promised and often at competitive price for the product ordered. Keep on ""Building"", Amazon, you've got a way to go, but I'm rooting for you! :-)",2.0
"Bought this toner cartridge from Amazon not even four months ago. These cartridges usually last almost a year for me, but I noticed poor quality printing on everything I print about 2 months after using it. Thinking I just needed to clean the heads of the printer I began my troubleshooting and after spending almost $200 for HP Service to come and diagnose my printer's problems, I learn that the toner cartridge is old and because it likely sat on a shelf for so long, the ink has dried and the random faded extra printing that shows up on my pages is due to the old cartridge. I believe I will go back and order through my regular office store.  My return period has expired unfortunately.",2.0
"This picture is an outright lie and misrepresentation. It was not an HP C096A as pictured. It was a knockoff cartridge by some 3rd party.

"Tough to get it to do duplex printing and it uses an in cartridge faster than any other printer I've ever had.  The quality is good, simple to hook up both via wireless and USB.  Good quality, yet expensive cost per page.",2.0
"Understood that this toner is for an old printer. But, my HP LaserJet 2100 still works fine.  Ordered 2 toners.  Both were defective.  The seller did make a full refund including shipping.  However, I felt like the cartridges he sent had been sitting around for quite a while and probably had passed their shelf life and should not have been sold in the first place.

I appreciate the seller working with me to give a full refund.  But, I'd like Amazon to allow the seller to provide return shipping labels for returns rather than having the buyer pay the shipping up front and get reimbursed.

"I would have given this product six stars if possible.  I ordered it twice in small quantities and I LOVED it.  When I was convinced that I would never again use any other paper, I placed a much larger order.  When I opened the first package and handled the paper, I said right out loud ""Those dirty dogs!""  The first two orders I received were substantial weight, bright white and had a smooth ""hand"".  When the third order arrived, it was lightweight, definitely not bright white, and somewhat rough to the touch.  I'm not sure I could have distinguished it from what we call the ""junk"" paper that we use in our office, which I got on a big sale for about $1 a ream.  I e-mailed the vendor to see what in the world was going on; I didn't think HP would stoop so low as to change the product, so I assumed the vendor was trying to pull a fast one.  The vendor replied that my e-mail was the first they had heard the problem mentioned, and there was no further response.  After I had finally used  up the entire order, I was hesitant to re-order the product from Amazon, so I went to Office Max and purchased two reams at nearly $14 each.  Again, it feels like third-rate paper.  I know it probably sounds like I'm a little crazy, but two other people in my office feel the same way I do about the paper being downgraded.  I won't purchase this product again, and now my search for a high-quality bright-white paper begins anew.",2.0
"The features were good, but the interface was very clunky and difficult to use. It offers just about everything from Caller ID to handset message retrieval, and I got about 200 yards away before being cut off. The  answering machine was good. Unfortunately, the battery life is short. It  claims a 14 day standby period and 8 hours talk time. Speaking only a few  hours indoors, it went dead. We went on vacation for six days. We left with  a full charge, and came home to a dead phone. We owned it for 4 weeks  before returning it for another unit. We charged the second one fully, and  it went dead after *maybe* 2 hours of talking at close range over a 3 day  period. We took it back immediately. We couldn't locate it centrally in an  open room like they suggest, but it was against a wall and we had little  (if any) obstructions when using it. We went to it from a 25 channel Lucent  model and were extremely disappointed. We recharged the Lucent once a week  tops, and that was not even necessary. Maybe the battery isn't strong  enough for all it offers?
Performance was decent, but far from excellent.  The range was great, but that was it. People said I sounded distant, and  the unit is small. My wife complained she couldn't hold it on her shoulder  easily and talk.
Please note the unit is not wall mountable.",2.0

"I have had this phone for 3 years now. I went from a 900MHz to this 2.4 GHz for the obvious benefits.  Since the first day of purchase, this phone had slight interfearance when moving from one area to another. The phone was great and the range was real good.  Only problem I experienced that made this a poor cordless was the interferences from the microwave oven and the above issue.  Recently I have major ""Out of Range"" messages on the display with very little reception but transmission is just fine.  Now this phone is useless.  A new battery did not repair this problem so it's the handset communications to the base unit as my callers do not experience the static.  Great phone while it lasted but it did not last long enough.  I have a KX-TG 1400 900 MHz which I paid [$$$] for and it performs better but less range.  Since I am usually near the base unit by 200' most of the time, the later phone out performs this very expensive one.  I am now looking for a replacement and I will go back to the 900 MHz Digital without a question.  Panasonic phones are best from my experience but this one was the worst value for my money ever.",2.0
"I got this phone in November 2000. The design and features are great.  The only thing that I missed is ability to use speed-dial buttons - you always have to go through a directory.  The range and clarity were pretty good in the beginning.
Then several months ago it just started deteriorate. I have to say that I didn't really take good care of the phone. But then LCD screen became loose, some buttons became a bit sticky and, most important, voice became garbled. The called would hear me fine, but I can barely make out what they're saying.
It's sad to replace this phone, but I'm going to give Uniden a try now.",2.0
"After owning this unit for 16 months, during which time it worked fine, a chip went bad causing horrible static and buzz which rendered the unit unusable; the service people indicated there was no fix other than paying big bucks to have it fixed while I would be without a phone for a month.  PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE -- I do NOT recommend this product. For [money], it should have worked longer than 16 months.",2.0
"I've now owned and used this phone daily for about a year and a half. Functionally, it works fantastic. I get great reception everywhere I need to. However, here are the problems...
* Every time the power goes out, I need to re-teach myself how to set the day and time by looking it up in the manual--it's not intuitive at all.
* The new message indicator is a small blinking red light, which is really difficult to see.
* The phone directory saves names and phone numbers, but it's cumbersome to use and again, requires frequent consults with the manual.
* Using redial is not a one button proccess like other phones. Rather, the user must scroll through the main menu, choose redial, then review the number before pressing talk to connect.
* While reviewing the answering machine's messages, it's impossible to listen to a phone number that someone left for you and punch it into the phone at the same time because as soon as you start to use the phone, the answering machine stops. So, you have to either remember the phone number, or write it down.
* Like on my cell phone, I like to dial the phone number, review it to make sure it's correct, then press talk to dial it. This phone doesn't allow you to do that.",2.0
"I'm a computer tech, and home tech. Utilizing home automation products, so I'm very competent with using home electronics. Fact is that after 1 year or so, started developing static/noise on the line, progressively getting worse. Constant out of range messages, as well as no talk activation. Called Panasonic said it was cheaper to replace the phone than repair it. If I could purchase the board they explain that goes bad I would replace it. People that haven't experienced problems got the good ones. Before the 1 year phone worked great. So the people not experiencing problems should not critic the ones that got stuck with the lemons. Pansonic lost me as a future customer, and a class-action suit should come forth.",2.0
"The phone looks good, and has a long range.
BUT, you always need the user guide because the interface is not intuitive at all. And worst, there are technical problems:
I had trouble with caller ID so I had to return the phone.
The display on the handset is dead, after less than a year.",2.0
"I bought this phone just six months ago and paid [alot].  For first two months the performance was good.  No problem at all.  Third month onward the handset started showing ""Out of range error"" even though the handset was at 1 feet distance from the base unit.  But with few retries, it was working.  Fourth month onward, we started getting frequent ""Out of range"" errors and some noise disturbance while talking. Today, 90% of time, it shows ""Out of range"" and if it is in range, caller-id doesn't work and even if caller-id do work, you still can't hear from the other side, because of extreme noise disturbance.  The blue-color scroll button also stopped working and doesn't scroll any numbers and again shows the same error ""Out of range"".
Wasted a lot money, just because of brand-name. We switched back to our regular phone with caller-id.",2.0
"I... expected perfection from panasonic. I have 2 big complaints:  1)Its unbelievable how poorly constructed this phone is! It sounds ok, but the handset creaks whenever you just squeeze it a little while talking. Its VERY annoying because the noises are amplified thru the earpiece and actually hurts my ear. Its like the parts don't fit well together or something. While talking on the phone its impossible to hold your hand perfectly still, so every time you move it makes creaking sounds (sorry but thats the best i can describe it).  2)The base unit will frequently malfunction and won't even pickup incoming calls, so the phone doesn't ring. Nothing on the base will work when this happens so I have to unplug it, then plug it back in and it usually works after that but is a major pain in the neck. Customer service didn't help. I would stay away from this phone for sure!!",2.0
"This is easily the coolest phone family on the market today.  Great looks, top-notch technology, etc. I purchased this unit (with the TAD) with high hopes and found it to be very very very disappointing. Here's why:  1) The TAD is all digital and the quality stinks. The sound it significantly better from my old tape-based answering machine. I wonder if this is the same for all digital systems....  2) The interfact is really counter-intuitive. For example, to deleted messages from the unit remotely, you have to hit 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1 (or something like that). The menu only lists one item at a time or ""Hit 2 for more options....""  Whoever thought of that should be shot.  3) You have to turn on a light to see how many messages you have. What happened to bright displays that glowed in the dark? Again, my old answering machine has this simple nicety.
The list goes on.... I'm returning this unit and putting my old tape-based answering machine back in service. Guess I'll have to shop for a new phone, too....",2.0
"I don't know if there is a better product on the market, but I have found many problems with this one.
My phone has also had static and shown ""out of range"" while I am standing a few feet from the base. I have found that if you put the phone back on the base and move it around a few times, it will start to work fine.  Something must be sticking on these phones.
I bought this 2.4GHz phone particularly because I did not want to get interference with the common 900MHz phones.  This is especially important to me because I have other 900MHz phones IN THE HOUSE as many people do.  Although this phone does use the 2.4GHz frequency, it ALSO USES 900MHz!!  I cannot use our 900Mhz phones while this 2.4GHz phone is in use; the conversation will cut out.  Also, it will interfere with the signal from the common 900MHz baby monitors.
Another complaint with the phone is the controls.  Everything seems to be abbreviated and most features are accessed through the function button.  One problem with this is that it is almost impossible to set some of the common features on the phone without the manual. (Make sure you keep the instructions!!) Another example of poor design is with redial.  Maybe it is just me, but I want to press ONE button to redial the last number. It takes several buttons to access the redial feature on this phone.  It is almost easier to just dial the number yourself.
If you have caller ID, the light on the base unit always flashes. This may be a standard in the phone industry, but the flashing light always makes me think that I have new messages on the answering machine.
The unit does have a few good features, but I expected more from Panasonic.",2.0
"I bought this phone (not from Amazon) less than a year ago and recently it has begun to badly malfunction. I get severe static moments into any call, and the static simply gets worse during a call. Also, it now loses its connection with the base unit on about a third of attempts--even when I hold the handset directly beside the base! I get the message ""out of range"" in these cases. So, I'm here to buy another phone and would suggest you pass on this one.",2.0
"I don't know about you, but when I shell out cash for the latest tech  gadget, I expect all the features of yesteryear and better.  So how come  there's no MUTE button??  And what's with the annoying menu navigation  button that's no user friendly??  Panasonic is not the only culprit though  because I have tried every 2.4 ghz on the market and 70% do not have MUTE.  What's going on here, do people not feel the need for privacy anymore? I  spend a lot of time on conf calls from home and I need a MUTE.
The phone  did have really excellent range though, looks cool and durable, great  clarity and no interference.  I just need a MUTE.  So, it went back to the  store along with the others.",2.0
"We've had Panasonic phones for awhile and have always been happy with  them.  This phone misses calls though: we'll pick it up and it'll take a  moment to connect then say ""Out of range"" even though it's next  to its handset.
I've missed too many calls with this phone and I'm here  now shopping for a new phone.
I strongly would not recommend this  telephone: especially at this price.",2.0
"I was (and still will am since I've returned the phone) looking for a high  quality speaker phone with a good range of operation for my home business.  The phone is not intuitive to use (e.g. if you type in a wrong number, it's  not obvious where the backspace button is, mute?).  The receiver is  awkward, heavy (compared to the Siemens model)and the notion that I'd have  to replace the batteries at some point make this a return.",2.0
The first cartridge did not work.  The cartridges are old even though they are in new boxes.  In the first cartridge the ink did not consistantly flow and we could not print out a full sheet.  If any more do not work I will add more to the review.,2.0
"Although several reviewers have had good luck with this ""compatible"" cartridge, my HP-430 plotter worked for a limited time w/ the first one installed, then refused to print with the second ""brand-new"" unit. I used my postal scale to compare the  weight of  a genuine ""HP - 40"" with these. My ""used-up"" one was only 3-4 grams lighter than brand-new  and the new one was spot-on the same weight. It may be that used immediately after arrival, these cartridges will be OK, however my plotter cartridge is changed only 4-5 times a year so the extra expense of a ***** rated genuine HP  cartridge that has worked every time I need one no matter when purchased is a better value ...",2.0
I purchased this Clovis a gift for my nieces and nephews. Within a couple of weeks the globe was in bad shape. It would constantly come apart from the seam on the equator not making it a practical gift for kids. If this is for an adult and its kept in a safe place you should be fine.,2.0
"Call me picky, but I expect lines of lattitude and longitude to meet precisely.  This globe had many places where lines of both lattitude and longitude were displaced, like landscape along an earthquake fault line.",2.0
The middle seam started splitting apart after only a couple weeks of shelf sitting and minor use. :(,2.0
"I know globes are expensive.  I thought for the money this one would work.  It's fair.  A couple of things... There is a small area that looks like it missed coloring during the printing process.  It's a small imperfection, about a 1/4 inch, but the area is just not there.  And there are some letters missing from the representation. Also, the globe just doesn't appear to be well made.  The stand looks cheap and the printed paper is not lined up well.  The second is that the globe is in Spanish.  I don't think that was mentioned in the description.  Whatever the case, it wasn't glaringly obvious.  I feel like that is a big no no if sellers aren't right upfront.  I have been buying from Amazon for a long time and I have had a few more hiccups in product quality over the past year than normal.  Save your money on this one.  It's not worth it.",2.0
Shoddy assembly. Poor attention to detail. Some lines askew.,2.0
CHEEP material!!!,2.0

Felt it was very cheaply made and too light and unsteady. It also arrived with a large indentation of about 4 inches across which seemed to be a manufacturing defect. Amazon made the return very easy and I am very grateful for that.,2.0
"This quality of this globe is very poor. Lots of place names are unreadable because the gores are so badly misaligned. For instance, pretty much all of the names of places on the west coast of Madagascar are cut off due to an adjacent gore pasted over them.

Way too small for my old eyes. Ended up buying an Atlas in hard print.,2.0

"It looks cheap.  Saw comparable globes later at Toys,R Us and at Barnes and Noble for half the price.

I guess cause you have to use them, you have to pay the price....Amazon's prices are fair for this, but HP should really be lowering their ink prices to keep their customers loyal!",2.0
"The relief on this globe was off by a good inch when measuring at the equator, meaning mountain ranges were in the wrong places. The stand was pretty wobbly, and it was nearly impossible spin the globe quickly because it was so light and the stand kind of flimsy. If you need a quick globe and don't care about quality, this one would work, but if you want one to keep for years and to be accurate then buy something more expensive and of a different brand.",2.0

You can't get updates or downloads anymore...skip it.

"This calculator is not allowed on any standardized tests, and a lot of teachers will probably not allow you to use it. This calc is only for professionals i would say. Go with the TI-89, it has all the functions and everything that the 92 has, but in a case the size of a TI-83. So you get the same power, but it doesnt look as badass, so your teachers won't get suspicious. and the 89 is allowed on standardized tests. the only thing the 92 has over the 89 is a larger screen, qwerty keyboard (which is why its illegal on tests) and geometry software, which is available to purchase and download for the 89. make a careful choice.",2.0
"This calculator obviously very powerful and has functionality beyong most $20 jobbys.  Graphing, deriving and solving simultaneous equations are all possible with the TI-92 or TI-89.
However gettting around the interface is slow.  Commands and menu options are not intuitive, and descriptions of functions is weak at best.  The instruction manual is of the olde white paper standard that was fortuantly antiquated by MBA marketing types in the 80's.  However no one with customer orientation standards must work at TI so we have a white page spec manual reminiscent of non-english speakers giving bare bone specs ala Roland Music or Casio (Insert in english instructiona manual written by fungible Japenese company here).
Also the buttons are hard to press and feel horrible, much like the old Hewlett-Packerd financial calculator stiff buttons.  No fun that.  Buttons are also too far apart and badly placed.  Also no need for a full alphebet so the TI-89 should be a better choice in any case.  This thing is way too big for what it does.
Now instead of concentrating the abstruse and more powerful functions to the more complicated menus and would make sense  The TI-92 makes simple functions fairly lengthy and annoying.  Try adding 2+2 and geetting an answer , it will take about 30 minutes to navigate the right menues to add 2+2.  I think the geniuses at TI should have made basic calculator functionality very accessible to start before woring about 3 demensional poleric graghing capabilites through third power derivitives.
Finally i am sure my review will get unhelpful ratings from all the calculator nerds that visit this page to rave about how cool their big calculator/computer with a lot of buttons is.  Indeed it is powerful and goes far beyond the pale of most other calculators, but TI really should hire some usibility experts and some technical writters to improve their unweildy and clumsy product.",2.0
"I bought this Southwestern Bell caller ID phone solely because I wanted something inexpensive and small for my desk.  What a mistake!  Every time I get a call, I have to lift the entire unit close to my face to see the caller ID. Sometimes when I pick up the handset to make a call, I don't get a dial tone until I click on the cut-off button.
It looks nice, but feels cheap.  Even for the slight cost, this phone is not worth the money.  Although it stores a sizeable list of incoming calls, erasing the list takes a fair amount of time if you've built up more than a few calls.

calculator has this incredible project flaw !
If you are wanting to buy just a financial calculator, your choice should be the HP12c. If you are wanting more than a calculator, buy a PDA instead. By the way, I now only use an HP12c and my broken HP19bII is comdemned to get dust.",2.0

The input methods feel like an afterthought, or very convoluted. The buttons feel mushy, with little to no tactile feedback. and the screen displays the bare minimum of data, which in a page long problem, cross referencing previous work is vital to completing the problem.

That said, if you aren't restricted by the class, I highly recommend saving up and buying a full fledged graphing calculator like the TI-84, or the other variants of that model. They will do everything you need, and probably more than you will ever need.

Confusing to use at times, especially bad during tests. For example if an answer is something like 3.5 x 10^11 (which is 350000000000) the calculator will show this number as ""3.5^11"" (which is 965491.57) even though it means to say 3.5x10^11. Standard calculators are supposed to use E to show this (as in 3.5E10), because the other way indicates a completely different value. So confusing.",2.0

"I did not like that they changed the keys, the old keys were smooth high quality plastic.  The new keys are coarse, they look like they are more prone to get dirty and harder to clean too.

HP 12C is all about feeling and ease of use.  No other calculator comes close for people in the finance industry, that is why it sells for USD 65 even in todays age where you can get an APP that costs USD 5.  Changing the feel and quality of keys is a big mistake IMO.

"My first HP12C calculator, which I purchased in 1998/1999, was perfect until someone stole it 4 years ago.  Since then, I've gone through 2 of them  It appears that they are not made to last and seem to breakdown quickly with keys sticking, incorrect outcomes (yes I know how to clear the previous memory) and my latest one didn't even last 2 weeks without the numeric images fading out and fractured.  In short the quality has significantly deteriorated but it is the only calculator that has such functionality.  I was hoping to at least get 2 to 3 years of functionality  but it is apparent that HP's quality control is poor or their component parts are inferior.  My first one was made in the US and the last 2 in Asia.",2.0
"I LOVE these calculators.  That said, you really need to be careful.  Many of those produced recently (say the last 5 years) or are refurbished are of much poorer quality than the original old faithful.

"This is a marvelous calculator. I've had one since 1988. Learn to use RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) and the ""stack"" of 4 registers and you will never go back to ""dumbo"" calculators again (I'm sorry, but you will quickly become a calculator snob and think of folks who don't use RPN and a stack as ""dumbos""). These have been in production since 1981 essentially UNCHANGED and there is a reason:  HP made something that was perfect and timeless, very rare for an electronic device.

But DO NOT buy these recently made models (recent meaning since approximately the early 90's). And especially don't buy the model sold now, which are made in China.  The problem is that the keys are very poor quality compared to the original ones made in the USA (USA production stopped in about 1990 or thereabouts).  I think that some of the ones made in the 1990's in Brazil Malaysia and Singapore may also be OK, but you can't be certain without doing research, but the USA made ones were made with superlative quality that can last a lifetime (hard to believe, but true I swear, having used mine daily for 26 years!).

I purchased a China made model recently for my wife.  The keys give ""false positive"" feedback.  So the little click you feel/hear when depressing a key sometimes is felt without the entry or keystroke being executed.  This is really awful for a financial calculator because you must have confidence in your calculation without having to start over and do it twice or three times.  Also, as other reviews point out, the keys have other problems like stopping to work entirely.  Also, the USA made models have expensive injection molded keys that will never wear off their numbers or symbols since they go below the surface, whereas the China made ones have painted keys that can wear off.  The USA made ones from the 1980's have slower processors, but it makes no difference practically speaking since it is fast enough, even if you are using it during an exam.

Here is the good news.  You can pick up a lightly used USA model on Ebay for $15-$30, less than one-half the cost of an inferior new model!  I recently lost my USA made HP 12C and bought 3 on Ebay (one for me, one for my wife, and one backup).  All 3 were in perfect condition - not even any scratches (better shape than my old one that I lost). I would say that approximately 10% of the ones on sale on Ebay are made in the USA.  If by chance this review is popular search engine wise and the info gets out, the price for USA made HP-12C's could go up on Ebay.  I would actually pay more for a used USA model than I would for the $55 new China model.

How do you know it is a USA made HP-12C?  Easy - just ask the seller to send you the serial number.  If in the 5th place of the serial number there is an ""A"", it was made in the USA (""B"" for Brazil, etc).  The first two digits are the year it was made, counting years since 1960.  The 3rd and 4th digit is the week it was made.  So for example, a serial number of 2752A19191 was made in week 52 of 1987 in USA.  Also, stamped to the left of the serial number will be ""USA"".

If a calculator for sale on Ebay is missing the rubber feet there are sellers who will provide replacement feet for 5 bucks or so.  The batteries required are 3 of the Energizer 357 button batteries or equivalent (later models use different batteries).

Another option is that you can buy a smartphone app that emulates exactly the HP-12C for $12 or less (HP charges the most for theirs).  I have the smartphone app and it is handy at times, but it simply cannot replace the physical calculator if you use it often.",2.0

It was suggested as the best one while I was in college, and it was the standard for new bankers in the commercial loan department.  (and yes, the keys stick as well).

"I ordered two of the TI-30Xa calculators in Nov, 2016, since my current TI calculator always seem to disappear (i.e. Wife and kids ""borrow"" it - for weeks). So I figured I would get them their own and save my frustration.

Upon receipt, right out of the box, the first calculator did not turn on. The second one turned on fine. So now I can either go buy a $4 LR44 battery to see if that is the problem (i.e. my time and battery cost to see if it hopefully fixes it), or take my time/trouble to repack a $9 calculator and return it and get a replacement. A 50% first turn-on failure rate is very disappointing. I have used nothing but TI calculators for probably 15 years, and have been nothing but satisfied with them - until now.",2.0
"Great calculator, and HP's excellent manual does the job. HOWEVER, it should last. The early HP25 could be dropped off the table, and I still have one - unfortunately the battery died, or it would be active still. The operator keys stopped working on my 17BII. Power came on, self-test wouldn't test, and the operator(+ - x, etc. ) had no effect. People should buy HP calculators because they work well, they are well documented and they LAST.

"I have owned an HP 12C for years.  I thought that getting this more modern calculator would be better because of it's menu driven interface.  I like the interface although i still like the form factor of the 12C better.  But what really bothers me is the display.  The contrast to get the menu's to work is awful.  You have to look at the display at just the right angle to see the numbers.  Really poor design.  If they corrected this flaw, which i consider major, then i would vote for it over the 12C.  With the display flaw however,  my vote goes to the 12C.  It is plenty fast enough for the majority of standard financial calculations.  It's form factor is great.  It is a classic.",2.0
I bought the HP12C in September 2012 to replace an old one I had from the late eighties. My old calculator was superb and lasted more than 20 years. This one is lower quality than average. The keys did stick for like a year and a half. After two years some of them did not stick anymore (among them none other than the 'Enter' key) so I am never sure if I performed the right calculation or not and many times I have to do it again. With a lot of regret I threw this calculator away today. I would have happily paid an extra $10 to have proper quality keys. I would encourage HP engineers to go check what their previous generation of engineers were doing because it is much better than what the current engineers are doing now.,2.0
"The lime green secondary key function labels (printed above the keys) have insuffient color contrast with the case's gray case, making reading the small-font labels difficult to see/read, a problem compounded by the shadow from the key above the label restricting lighting on the labels.

"As many users have pointed out, the newer HP12c models appear to be worse than those produced back in the day. I am convinced this is true. I bought my first HP12c on Amazon in 2011 when I started my job in finance as an investment analyst. About a year later, I started getting ""PR Error"" messages when I turned on the unit. Strange since my co-workers who are in their 40s have had their HP12cs since they were in their 20s and their calculators have never malfunctioned. Obviously this became annoying/inconvenient for me, as I couldn't use the calculator when it displayed the error message, so I bought a second HP12c (again on Amazon) I believe around 1 year ago. It is my go-to calculator for the Level III CFA exam I am taking in a few weeks, and now one of the digits is all screwy and not displaying correctly. I am totally dependent on my HP12c - I honestly don't even know how to use regular calculators anymore I've grown so used to the RPN system - but I'm deeply frustrated at having to purchase a $50-$70 calculator each year. I'm also nervous it will malfunction during my upcoming exam. I'll probably be that nerdy looking Asian girl with 5 HP12c calculators on exam day, but you know what?

The description states this is essentially the same calculator as in the 1980's. Maybe in function and appearance but certainly not in quality. I purchased this calculator in 1985 and it was very sturdy and lasted me over 20 years. Since then I have had three of these and all have died after about 18 months. The culprit is usually the buttons which either stop working or present multiple digits with just one press. This last time my display has gone on the blink.

"I have been using an HP 12C since my grad school days in the mid-1980s. I still had the original from then until just a few years ago when it was lost (or stolen?). I am now on my second replacement. The quality of materials and workmanship is definitely lower now than it was in 1985. The first replacement worked fine for 1-2 years then started yielding inexplicable and inconsistent errors in calculations. The second replacement - which I've only had for two years or so - now has a defected #1 key. The key doesn't fully spring back up when released and has to be pressed VERY HARD to get the #1 to register at all. Obviously, this makes it very difficult to achieve any sort of speed, which is one of the main advantages of RPN. I will be getting another replacement now, sadly knowing that it, too, will probably have to be replaced within a couple of years. Because of the price, it's hardly worth pursing the matter with HP, but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the current product. I downloaded an HP 12C app for use on my iPhone. It works fine, but it lacks the tactile sensation of the real thing, so the process of using it is much slower than on the real HP 12C.",2.0

"I read the negative reviews about the keypad but bought an HP 12C anyway  thinking the others might be more picky than me.  Unfortunately the only way to be certain a digit is entered is to carefully and firmly press the key. The tactile feedback does NOT mean the digit has been registered. Im a slow fingered user but even I would find my calculations were wrong because I pressed the operator key before confirming the value on the display.
Most new users find RPN confusing and refuse to learn it. That keeps existing users like me the prime customers for new HP calculator products. Unless the keypad reverts to its previous quality this will be my last purchase. Of the many 12Cs Ive owned and given away there has never been a failure. My oldest 12C was actually made in the USA! My old HPs will probably last another 20 years; long enough to get me to the grave.
 The new calculator was lightning fast. I will miss that but I returned the 12C for a refund.
With new users reluctant to try RPN and old users like me deserting, HP will be forced to discontinue this product line. I hope someone in the company pays attention to these reviews and acts to save them.",2.0

They should have kept the old and added new as required.  I get so sick of electronics folks moving all the furniture, just so they can feel clever.  It is disruptive and time consuming to constantly have to figure out stupid process issues about where keys are newly located instead of just being able to use all the familiar keys and learn the new ones or new extra functions.

"It seems that the only thing that has changed from HP for this legendary calculator has changed for the worst. A reviewer in March of 2010 noted that the manual that came with the calculator was easy to follow.  I just received my calculator a few days ago and there was no printed manual/user's guide. Instead, there was a nearly useless ""quick start"" guide that just describes each key, and the actual user's guide on a disk. Since there are no additional useful items on the disk, such as an interactive tutorial or an increased number of examples to supplement the original user's guide, the only justification for the switch by HP is saving the company money in printing and packaging costs. But if I have to sit in front of a computer to use my calculator, I may as well just use my spreadsheet. I could print out the entire user's guide myself at an additional cost of $20, but then it would not be nicely bound and easily carried with me wherever I need it. If this were a computer peripheral, then HP could reasonably expect people to sit in front of a computer to use it. But the reason you buy a calculator is to not have to be in front of a computer. This calculator remains expensive, and HP should provide a full printed version of the user's guide, as they did in the past. I am contacting HP to see if they still have printed user guides available. Excellent calculator, but the user's guide is a main reason it is so well regarded. Very disappointed with HP in this respect.",2.0
"I bought this calculator for college Chemistry and Trigonometry as we are not allowed to use more advanced graphing calculators because we can use them to cheat and store data such as formulas (or other notes such as definitions). This calculator has all the necessary functions needed to do the advanced calculations without cheating. But after 2 months of using this calculator, I'm back on Amazon to upgrade in 2 areas.

1) This calculator is unable to show answers by keeping the fraction or square root formulas, it always wants to finish the calculation and provide the decimal answer - this is actually problematic for some calculations in math where we WANT to keep the fraction version of the answer, or keep the root number without converting to the decimal, or keep the Pi radian answer without converting to the decimal number again. For this I drop it 1 star.

2) My second reason drops it another two stars and what ""broke the camel's back"" for me to no longer want to use this calculator... too often, I find that while trying to punch in calculations, it will NOT enter a number, and I have experienced this around once in every 15-30 numbers I punch in. It's so often, that I have become paranoid in watching that every number I pressed showed up on the screen display, which slows things down, especially on timed tests. Even then, I have experienced twice now... I missed a question on an exam/quiz simply because of this calculator error! You can't imagine the frustration of punching in your calculations again to realize your calculator gave the correct answer, meaning the reason I wrote down the wrong answer on the exam was purely due to a missed punched in number. Furthermore, I watched a classmate next to me disappointed that she missed a quiz question for this exact reason, and when I asked to see what calculator she had used, it was this exact same model. We both realized it's a common frustration with this calculator.

In the past the keys were well fitted in the calculator casing to give it a solid feel. Now the keys jiggle within the casing, especially if you hold it upside down and lightly shake it back and forth.

"Although I am certain this calculator will someday serve me as I expected when I purchased it, it is hard to learn. I suggest having a course on the fundamental usages. There should be a ""manual for dummies"" or first time users guide. It is very difficult to understand.",2.0
I purchased this item at the Navy Exchange yesterday thinking it was a good price.  It looked good in the plastic wrapping but now that I have it on my desk at home I'm not real happy with it.  It is cheaply made although it looks okay.  The buttons on it are not set well and some are loose and you twist them to make them upright.  I always thought Texas Instruments made great products but not sure now.....email me at jerryjackson@hawaii.rr.com.,2.0
"This calculator is inexpensive and useful for most problems and calculations. I do, however, think it was a mistake to use this in second semester physics. For big calculations, like figuring how much gas I used last month, this bad boy works great. This calculator has a nasty habit of rounding things beyond the 9th digit, however. This means that when calculating things like particle mass or very miniscule velocities (which happens in physics), you have to plan for it to RUIN your calculation. I spent so much of this summer thinking I was an idiot. Contrarily, it just turns out the TI-30Xa just gets off on making me have panic attacks before exams. If you buy this, plan for this, and make sure you aren't calculating tiny, tiny, numbers when you check your answer. May the force be with you, always.",2.0
"Rounds too early, very inaccurate results. Would not recommend.",2.0
Very disappointed!  Six weeks of VERY light use and half of the screen no longer works. No idea why. The protective cover has always been on when not in use. I had a TI calculator as a teen that lasted years and years of rough and tumble use. This lasted just long enough to be outside of the return window.,2.0
"My professor did not allow graphing calculator in his exams, so got it in a college bookstore. It's got some solid functions so that saved them a star.

The buttons are not sensitive (no feedback), one must press firmly and look and the display to make sure the numbers entered are correct.  Even when pressing firmly, frequently the numbers do not register.  The memory (+, -) functions are also non responsive - there is no indication (feeback) the numbers have been recognized/entered.  Other units I have used at least blink each time the M+ or M- buttons are pressed.  Recently, I have had better luck with Casios and will give one a try.",2.0

"I purchased this for a university physical chemistry course I was taking where we weren't allowed to have a programmable calculator.  This calculator gets the job done, but is very cumbersome to use for multi-step calculations.  It is a very basic calculator, and is a horror to use if you're accustomed to using a graphing calculator.

If your goal is to use this calculator for simple one step functions, then it will work fine.  More complex calculations are a pain.  The features that make more complex calculations easier like storing and recalling numbers, and using parentheses are non-intuitive; and the single line display makes following what you're doing extremely hard, thus mistakes occur frequently.

The construction and general quality of this calculator is mediocre.  The buttons are not very responsive, I have mis-strokes frequently.  It doesn't have solar power, which for a calculator this basic is just dumb.  The cover doesn't slide back on the calculator smoothly, and has to sort of be forced on.

If you're looking for a nice scientific calculator then I would strongly recommend the Texas Instruments TI-30X II S over this model.  The II S model has a two line display which makes it easier to follow what your doing, the parentheses and sto/rcl functions are easy to use, it has an ANS key for using the previous answer, and it has arrow keys to scroll through previous operations.  It has a solar panel, and is only about $5 more.

Overall the TI-30XA functions as a scientific calculator, but is a pain to use for more complex calculations, and has cheap construction.  I strongly recommend spending a little more money and getting a better calculator.",2.0

Using this calculator to do senior level courses in Mechanical Engineering is a huge headache.

For non graphing calculators, I highly recommend a two line calculator, like the TI-30X IIS.",2.0
"I know; had I read the entire description I'd have known it was battery powered.  But I haven't seen a scientific calculator of this size with batteries for many years (and I taught math for 40 years).

"For a calculator, it is ok.  It is not programmed as well as some other models meaning you average one or two keystrokes more per calculation.  This may not sound like a lot, but wait till you have to make numerous calculations on a test and you are stuck typing 6-7 keys instead of 4-5 keys.  It adds up.

"Let's be honest - this calculator may have been excellent 20 years ago, but looking at its feature set...

It's horribly hard to use; it has two negative symbols (and spits a syntax error if you use the wrong one); the numerical solver can't solve equations (try solving for equations in the form of 1/x + 1/y = 1/z) that can be very simply solved by humans, and so on.
I mean, even try directly putting in 2\frac{\frac{5}{4}}{3} (latex format; in parentheses it is 2((5)/(4)/3) without the multiplication operator in front of the 2). This throws a syntax error!

Simply put, this calculator is a complete disappointment. It is awful to use, has weird syntax requirements, and the numerical solver flat out won't work for many circumstances. The only reason to even purchase one is if you're required to use it.",2.0

I probably could give up the rpn but other issues caused me to have to give up on the TI. First the buttons; they are very mushy. My old HP calculators had a nice click with a button press. Not so with the TI. The buttons felt like those on a $2 calculator. Second the buttons; the function buttons (+, -, *, /) are in a silver color with the function indented into the key. If the light was not just right I could not see the function. I would have to wiggle the calculator around to get the light right so I could read the function.

I had to be really careful to press it just so and/or pay attention to the numbers making sure the calculator picked them all up. This slowed me down and killed my focus..

"I don't know why everyone gave this calculator such high reviews because I found it to be an ok product. First of all, the calculator I received had some previous calculations in its memory whiCH I had to clear and it gave me the impression that it was previously used by someone. Secondly the cover for the calculator is annoyingly sticky, it is hard to slide on or off the cover because it gets stuck easily. Thirdly, the buttons on the calculator are  tough to press- as I was calculating, I had to press down hard on a few numbers and twice to have that numerical show up on the screen. For me this is a deal breaker especially as an accounting student where if a single number is missing, it messes up the whole thing. Hence I am returning this product.",2.0

"This calculator is widely available, and I believe I bought mine at Target, hence why I'm not a verified purchaser.

Here is my background, coloring my perspective of my review: I'm an electrical engineer who was forced to use this in school for some high level courses wherein the instructor had a misplaced hate-affair with modern technology. For some reason, I've developed a bit of a calculator collection, so I inevitably will compare it to the rest of my collection.

For the most part, this calculator gets the job done. The two line display is nice for ensuring you typed in your expression correctly. It has a reasonably well designed button layout, though I wish the base 10 exponent wasn't hidden behind a second keystroke. It is solar powered with a battery backup, so it starts up fine in low-light situations. As far as I can tell, the battery is not user-replacable, but in several years of ownership I've had no power issues.

My complaints about the calculator may sound minor, but I think given the numerous alternatives to this calculator that address these issues, they are enough to warrant a two-star total. Here are my complaints -

First, there is no complex number functionality. Perhaps this isn't so important for the target consumers, but honestly in my mind it's hard to justify calling this a scientific calculator when it doesn't have this capability.

Second, the keys are perhaps the worst on any calculator I've ever used. You know those dollar store cheapie basic calculators? They feel better to use than this one. I find myself frequently typing at a speed that is apparently too fast, and the calculator does not register all  the numbers and symbols that I wanted. No calculator should put a hard limit on the user's typing speed. Ridiculous.

Lastly, it is impossible to take previous results (beyond the previous answer) and use them in new calculations unless you think ahead enough to store it to one of the five available storage registers. This can often be a nuisance when doing complicated calculations with multiple sub-results.

Is this calculator bad? I suppose it isn't. Are there many other better options? Yes, and for similar prices! Look into alternatives before buying this.",2.0
It's worth spending a little more to get a different model.  The keys are not the easiest to press and they don't always register that I have pressed the key.  I have to be very careful to make sure each button I press registers because it can throw off your calculations.,2.0

"The one I received malfunctioned the first week.  The '6' key doesn't work quite right -- randomly inserting 6's without the button being depressed.  Pressing the '6' key a couple times fixes the issue temporarily, but the problem keeps coming back.  I suspect this is a fluke, but haven't read other reviews to see if anyone else has this problem.

The calculator has all the functions I want and the layout is fine.  Conceptually it's a good product but the construction isn't high quality -- and therefore, in my opinion shouldn't be branded as ""pro"".  The case and buttons are all made of plastic, although some of them are shiny, giving them a metal appearance.  I would prefer an aluminum housing with buttons machined to a higher tolerance so they don't feel so loose -- even at 2 or 3 times the cost, it would be well worth it to have something that would last a long time, especially under heavy use.  I suspect that T.I. (and other calculator manufacturers) strongly disagree about how many calculators I should purchase in my lifetime.

That being said, I'm looking for something better but don't know if it exists.",2.0
"I gave this product a low rating for two reasons:

1) Several horizontal lines of pixels on the screen do not work.  Given this, it is often difficult to see calculations.

"This calculator arrived as stated but did not meet my expectations.  I expected the calculator to be relatively free of defects OR to at least have obvious ones noted in the description.  Pixels on the calculator are non-functional.  (Pixels may be the wrong term though.)  Basically, when I attempt to pull up the constants screen which lists constants at the very bottom of the screen, the bottom portion of the constants menu is cut off making it hard to discern what you are looking at.  Fortunately for me, I have used this calculator alot so I know what should be there.  However, this is a major flaw and should have been noted.  Will not purchase from this seller again.",2.0
"This calculator will do well for students who are doing homework for their lower level classes but for the professional, the HP 49GX or HP49G is superior, both in terms of capability and product quality.  As a chemical production engineer, I had a TI-89 until a fall from my desk left it dead.  Since I had used an HP 41CV in school, I decided to replace it with an HP 48GX.  Since that time I have noticed that ALL of my professional colleagues use HP calculators.  Since that time, my HP has survived bumps, falls, and even complete submersion in water and still works as well as the day I purchased it.
If you are a high school student and looking for a calculator for math class, buy the TI.  On the other hand, if you are an engineer, or a student who wants to learn engineering on the calculator you will use once you are a professional, get the Hewlett Packard.",2.0
"The only reason I have a TI 89 is that many of my students use some sort of TI calculator and I can see what they are talking about when they ask me a question about it. For my day to day work I use either my HP48 or 49. There is a much greater availability of free programs for both the HP 48 and 49 than for most of TI's calculators.
Texas Instruments has always been more proprietarily oriented than HP. An example is the computer interface Graph Link cable. You have to pay twice as much it compared to the standard RS-232 cable that you can use for HP 48 and 48 calcs. Also you have to buy proprietary software to transfer files to their calulators, but Kermit is freely available for many platforms to use with the HP 48 and 49.
It also must be remembered that the TI only transfers lists that are translated by the calculator, which in my opinion is a definite drawback.
The copy protection of the calculator also makes it harder than it needs to be to upgrade the operating system compared to the HP 49. I have upgraded the ROM on my 49 several times and have had no problems, but I have not done so on my 89 because of stories of how an interrupted upgrade of the ROM can cause the calculator to become useless.
Back in the middle 70's and early 80's TI had somything to brag about with the 50 series calulators. The only thing they really have to brag about now is that they have a greater market share than HP does in terms of calculator sales. Microsoft does too, but we all know what junk Microsoft produces.",2.0

"The screen was ruined, other than that great",2.0
"As far as the final product is concerned, they are nice looking cards. It's very clear they are homemake (kind of expected that but hoped they'd be better). The problem I had with them was the printing process. Three in, I ended up on an office supply store's website nearly ready to just order cards online. It took just over an hour to print them and a considerable amount of swearing. It got to the point a friend ended up helping me by feeding each sheet into the back of the printer while I sent the document to the printer. I'm not sure if it was the paper or the print that was to blame but the process was awful! I stopped counting how many times it ""jammed"" and we were being very, very careful. One two actually got stuck but many ""jammed"" just from being set on the document tray.

I wanted to make my own invitations for three reasons:

1) Shipping time. I wanted to be able to make them quickly (HA!) and send them out without having to wait. In hindsight, they'd have been sent out much, much easier had I not decided to print them from home.

2) I wanted to be able to print the number I needed and more if needed without the weight time/extra unused cards. Again, stupid.

3) Being able to put text on all sections of the card was a plus given the type of party they were used for. I used them for my grandmother's 90th b-day and these allowed me to include more details (a message on the back about the structure of the party, a website we set up, etc.) than online pre-designed cards allowed.

In short, if you have a printer that handles thick paper well, these are not bad. They are also a reasonable options if you want to send out a few invitations, not cards, thank you cards, or the like. Or if you live on a deserted island without a store. I needed all 20 for the party and the hour it took to print them (additional time for design and don't even think about using the templet) which I believe was too much time for the look of the final product.

I really wish I'd just order cards online. I'll be doing that in the future.",2.0
The fold scoring on the batch I received is very poor.  The edges opposite the fold do not line up well and the paper on the outside of the fold breaks and gives a ragged looking folded edge.  I am used to variable quality on this product but this batch is particularly poor.,2.0

Out of frustration, we have gone back to our old  laser printer (boy, those HP machines just keep on going...), hoping that  we'll tackle the problem again soon.
To top it off, in the middle of a  copying job we received the J1 message on the copier, meaning we have 10  (that's TEN) copies left on the toner cartridge, so we had to stop the  copying run. Went to every Staples, Office Max, and Office Depot in our  area...even went on line to check Staples and Office Depot--NO ONE had them  in stock. That's a problem caused by the manufacturer, not the  distributors. In desperation, called Xerox, who said they can be bought  here at Amazon.
Xerox really dropped the ball on this product, whose  specs are good but lots has gotten lost in the execution. I would not  recommend this product until they have worked out the bugs, probably 6  months-1 year.",2.0

The three cards that I was able to coax through the printer (HP C7180) are beautiful.  Fifteen sheets either jammed or showed smudge marks even after repeated trouble-shooting and cleaning of all printer parts (for 2, I fed them incorrectly).  The printer handles every other paper I have tried without any problem whatsoever - photo, resume, business card, etc.  I simply could not get this paper to feed into my printer properly.  I ordered a second box and took the files to a printshop.  They said they couldn't guarantee that it would go through their machines either.  I finally had them print it on their card stock.  The quality of the three that I ultimately printed was much higher than the print-shop version, so for that the product gets 2 stars.",2.0

Also the template for MS Publisher is only for a size slightly smaller than the 8-1/2 x 11 size of the Avery product so I attempted to download the Avery template.

This calculator is pretty crappy to be honest. I typed in -5 squared and it gave me the answer -25. I typed in -5*-5 and it gave me the answer 25.

"This calculator is ok, but could be soooo much better. I got this calculator because it is the only allowed calculator for tests in my engineering classes, if not, I would have sticked with my casio fx-300 ms.

This calculator gets the job done, don't get me wrong, but it has some problems that always bug me. Fist of all the ANS key and the EXP key are soft keys (you have to press 2nd to access them), that is a huge problem for me. Those are the two keys that I use most after the numbers and the operation keys, it sucks that I have to click the 2nd key to access them. The next big problem is that the keys are don't click very well, you have to press them and then make sure that they actually pressed, I constantly get wrong answers because my some of my key-presses don't get entered into the computation.

The pros of this calculator are that it is lightweight and small and the display is very nice. Answers and computations are clearly displayed in an easy to read manner.

Like others have mentioned, this calc does not register every button entry when typing at normal speeds.  For $3-$5 more you can purchase the TI36X Pro which will register your clicks AND features 4 lines of text instead of 2. Not sure why this thing exists.

"LAYOUT: Intuitive, no gripes here. Screen is more or less easy to read.

OPERATION: Good. You more or less enter operations as you would write them, e.g. ""-log(Ans)."" Some scientific calculators respond to operation buttons by performing that operation on whatever number happens to already be on the screen. Huge headache; avoid those.

USABILITY: Pretty terrible and the primary reason I'm giving this calculator a low rating. Several other reviewers have noted that the buttons are stiff. I cannot reiterate this enough: you REALLY have to forcefully press each button down--while watching the screen--if you want to make sure you haven't missed any digits.

That is time and attention spent focusing on the physical mechanics of your calculator, rather than the mechanics of your calculation.

Do you remember how it felt when you first started learning how to type on a touchscreen? You probably went really, really slowly. Nowadays you probably zoom right along. Your fingers move about as quickly as your thoughts. I'm used to that same level of responsiveness and confidence from my hand-me-down TI-85. Moving to this calculator feels like I'm learning how to type on a touchscreen all over again, but worse--because I know the button quality isn't going to improve over time.",2.0

"I had an old solar powered version of TI-30 calculator that I purchased maybe around 1998 or 2000, which I liked and was accustomed to using. Finally a couple months ago a few of the buttons near the bottom, the decimal point and zero mainly, started to get unreliable. My work as an R&D machinist cutting into costly one-off prototype parts requires me to avoid errors as much as possible, so I bought a new battery-only TI-30Xa as a replacement. Well that is OK but it powers down pretty soon if left for a few minutes. I often like to refer back to my last result to remind/reassure myself that I have not had a brain fart, and my old solar one would stay on indefinitely as long as the lights were on.

So I saw this solar powered TI-30XIIS in pink for sale for about $6 at a local store. The first thing my co-worker said when he saw me with a pink calculator was ""That was on sale really cheap, wasn't it?"" Well I thought the 2 line display would be an advantage, because now I could reassure myself about my last inputs as well as my last result. And it is good that way. I can even recall and review previous calculations. And I have not had the button feel or button reliability problems reported by many others here.

Unfortunately, this thing powers down just as fast as the TI-30Xa, even in bright light. Plus I do not like the arrangement of the buttons... It has the ""ON"" button down in the lower left while my other TI calculators had them in the upper right, and other things have been shuffled around as well. Texas Instruments must be taking lessons on confusing customers from Microsoft; how about the automakers adopt this tactic and experiment with gas pedals on the left and brakes on the right? How would that work out? Also this calculator is lacking the 1/x button, which I happen to use very often. And the frequently-used square root key has been demoted to a ""2nd"" function.

It is too bad they could not add the new advantages without scrambling up the good things they had before. Hey Texas Instruments, how hard is it to respect -- and take full advantage of -- the speed habits that you yourselves have built up in your customers?",2.0

The 2nd time it went in, they corrected the problem which lasted about 3  weeks. Then, one day, it snatched in a page and managed to crumple it up  and damage the print head in the process. Ink all over the interior  resulted in replacement of the platten. Insult to injury was added on when  I was charged for a new print head even though the machine was still under  warranty.

The colors are not true to the digital picture.  Also, if you don't use the cartridge up in a short time the quality gets worse.  The black and white printing is fine, except the cartridges do not last very long, even with little printing. ...  Good Luck.",2.0
"I am an electrical engineer and I do a lot of polar to rect and rect to polar conversions.  I already had the TI-30X which I bought at Walmart.  The TI-30Xa is a superb calculator and does polar/rect & rect/polar conversions as easy as the HP 45 and the HP 11C.  The TI-30X is in the class with the HP45 & HP11C and at $12 at Walmart it can't be beat.

I bout the TI-30X IIS thinking it would be an improvement over the TI-30X.  But instead the TI-30X IIS is cumbersome and clunky to use.  To do polar/rectangular rectangular/Polar conversions requires many more key strokes.  In addition the coloring of the second fuctions is in color blue and is very difficult to see.  The second functions on the TI-30Xa is a light green that stands out and is very easy to use.

Also, the TI-30X IIS instructions are pitifull, a single large page which is almost unreadable.  The TI-30Xa at least has a booklet with pretty decent set of instructions.

In my opinion you should not waste your money  on the TI-30X IIS even though it isn't that expensive.  Instead go with the TI-30Xa and you will have all you need for most engineering needs.",2.0

"I am a TI faithful; my first calculator was a TI SR-51A, and I've had several other TI calculators since then.  The TI-30XIIS has plenty of fine functionality BUT it has several vexing flaws:

1) The high-contrast display they show in the pictures is not what I see on my calculator.  My display is more like slightly dark gray on slightly light gray.  Oddly, the problem is particularly pronounced when I view the calculator straight on, as would be the case if I am holding it in my hand.  The display is barely visible.
2) This is a solar-only calculator.  My office is reasonably bright (I've got a window), but I still get a dim display.  I don't know how well it would work in low-light situations, but the prognosis isn't good.
3) I seem to be able to hit the keys faster than the calculator can accept them, which leads to a lot of frustrating errors.

I purchased the TI-30XIIS to replace a TI-30XS.  The old calculator has none of these problems, and thus it is still what I use at work, while the 30IIS collects dust.",2.0
Why would you use chrome plated keys without some sort of contrasting lettering on them? Crappy looking chrome plating at that. Since my vision is not what it used to be I had to return this unit.,2.0
"I ordered three of these calculators. While two were in good shape, one didn't work at all. I hit the reset button, but it would still only show half of a number on the screen. I have to say, I'm glad that two of them work, but am very disappointed overall that the one isn't able to be used and I will have to return.",2.0
My calculator came without cover and that's not what I expected I was disappointed because that wasn't what the image displayed.,2.0
I was really looking forward to how cool/cute the pictured item would be. I guess I should have read the comments before buying it! I didn't get the calculator as shown nor the nicer raspberry pink one for that matter...nope I got a plain pink with white window screen frame. Although yes it's still pink it's not the shade or look I wanted. Yes the calculator part is what matters but I wanted mine with a little more personality.,2.0
"I've had lots of problems with this printer since day one. The paper often jams; the color cartidge clogged and caused the printer to stop working until I removed it; the output often smears or is misaligned. I am very disappointed. I may have a lemon, but I won't be buying a Canon product when I replace this printer.",2.0
"I have had mine a little over a year, and while it did great at printing both in black and in color (the output of photo-type documents was grainy at best), I had habitual problems with the printer not printing in black.  It would go through all the motions, and even replacing the ink tank and  print head did not fix it. Canon's advice was to take it to a service  center, which led me to the ""it's cheaper to buy a new one than to fix  it"" situation. Printheads, at $52 or so each, don't last as long as I  had hoped either. Not a bad printer, and maybe you will not have the  problems mine has, but I must believe there are better on the market",2.0
"I only purchased this item because I had to have it for a class in collage. But what I recieved was a dinged up hunk of junk with a screen that has a line threw it that makes it very hard to read the anwsers to the calculation you put into it. No good, just junk. I could have got a nock off brand from Wallgreens for $14 and it would have dune the job. So to sum up how I feel about this Is I paided to much for a abused and broken calculator.",2.0
"I bought this calculator for $120, and although I had some gripes with the convoluted combination of buttons I had to press in order to get certain results, it worked well and seemed fairly versatile.  But one day, five months after I bought it, the display went completely wonky.  I performed a master reset, which worked for three days, and then the display screwed up again.  Shortly thereafter, the calculator stopped working altogether.  I called customer service, and they advised me to try all the things I had already tried.  They didn't seem to understand that it wasn't simply out of batteries, but dead.  And now I can't return it, having lost the receipt when I moved shortly after buying the calculator (mea culpa, I admit), but for God's sake, I still have the packaging, which has a little box with a serial number and says ""Proof of Purchase,"" but according to TI, does not Prove that it was Purchased.  They gave me the options of 1.)Drop $120 on a new calculator, 2.)Drop $170 on our TI 84 Plus, now with extra unnecessary features, or 3.) Have a nice day, sir.",2.0
"...but 0 stars for reliability.  After 2 years of use, my son's TI-83 Plus is kaput.  He cannot see the print on the screen (and, yes, we tried all the ""2nd/up"" contrast settings, removing the batteries and resetting steps, etc.  Even called customer service).  They say his silver screen is shot.  Only $58.00 to replace with a reconditioned calculator!!
I am inclined to say it's quite a scam that every student in his school is required to buy a TI-83 or 84, because I would love to try a HP to see if the quality is any better.  : (",2.0
I was looking for a less complete calculator than my TI-82 but find that this one really sticks. I get an outrageous answer and realize I missed a digit somewhere. Very frustrating.,2.0
"The keys are horrible. They don't register right so when you try to do 2+2+2+2+2, it instead reads as 22+2+22. It's okay for small calculations, but for high school or college, stick to the TI-83.",2.0
"I have always loved TI calculators, but the buttons on this calculator are too hard to press.  Sometimes it feels like you pressed the number, but it does not register on the screen.  It does not happen too often, but it is often enough that you have to constantly look at the screen while you are entering numbers just to make sure they registered.

The screen is also a little washed out.  After cursing my new TI-30X IIS a number of times, I bought a

"This calculator is not worth the money it costs to buy, its like your grandfathers calculator. TI has failed to improve on even basics like screen resolution. Why? because TI has a monopoly on the market, most math text books today only show how to use TI and most teachers learned on the same them selves and are unfamiliar with other brands. TI can sit comforatbly where it stands, selling mediocre calculators for exorbant prices, reguardless of advances in technology, because thay know you will struggle in any math class without it. Come on TI where is the improvement?",2.0

"Ugh, I just opened this calculator and I'm sorely disappointed.  I wish I had read the reviews more carefully, particularly the 2 and 3-star reviews.  I bought this calculator because it was one of the bestselling basic calculators and had a 4-star average.  I wish I had read the lower star reviews a bit more carefully.  Like several other reviewers have noted, the main problem with this is the keypad.  I just tested the calculator with a few basic calculations and it frequently does not register a key strike.  I bought this calculator so I could do basic math for my tests, and there's no way I'm going to rely on this calculator because it's very easy to hit a key, think you punched in a number that doesn't register, leading to a wrong answer.  It's entirely unreliable.

I got this calculator because it was relatively inexpensive and fit my needs, but I will end up spending more money just to buy another calculator that actually works properly.",2.0
"This calculator is okay.

The Good: The key layout is familiar, it has high functionality, it is rugged and long lasting.

The REALLY Bad: Precision is key on a calculator, one wrong stroke can make the difference between shooting the moon and crashing a satellite, so to speak.  If you type too quickly on this calculator it will skip entries and only log the ones it catches.  This problem is compounded by the fact the characters on the screen are very large, so the screen can only hold so much of a operation on the screen at a time.  This makes it time consuming to check for errors.

The Ugly: I hate plugging other products in reviews, but the other 2 star ratings are right.  If you want the familiar layout, the functionality, the rugged construction, and precise key entry, get a newer model of the TI-30 series.  This calculator is fine for homework and leisure calculations, but in a time crunched test it will end up becoming a test of your patience.",2.0
"My daughter chose this calculator due to the cute floral design shown in the picture. Well, it's pink and it's a calculator, but has NO floral design. How hard is it to put up a picuture and sell what is advertised? My daughter decided to keep it, but seems disappointed overall. This may seem a little petty, but I expect to get what I paid for. In this case, that didn't happen. I give it two stars simply for its functionality.",2.0

Little did I know that it is an OLD model. I would avoid this product and go for the newer version of the TI-30! The TI-30XS is the same price and is much more usable and has more features! The buttons on this calculator are VERY loose and make data entry tricky for fast calculation. One must constantly verify that each button press has been recognized. These loose buttons are annoying if you are accustomed to quick calculations. It makes the calculator essentially unusable. I expected much more from Texas Instruments, as I really adore my 83+SE, but this is an utter disappointment.

I wish amazon had alerted me to the new version (as they do with some other products).

The buttons work great and they've also improved on a lot of other features.
----------------------

I bought this calculator to take the FE exam. There are only a handful of approved calculators and so I chose this for the following reasons:

- Two line display
- I've been using a TI-83 Plus for almost 10 years and I thought that this would be easy to learn
- Solar - don't have to worry about batteries
- Inexpensive

I've been sorely disappointed with this calculator. The buttons are horrible! What good is a calculator if I can't type the information correctly? Also, the case is awkward and flimsy. Don't expect the same type of quality that you get with the graphic calculators, TI cut corners on this one. I don't recommend this calculator if you are going to be under tight time constraints because you will waste a lot of time fixing typing errors.

I've also had issues with the transition to a non-graphing calculator. It hasn't been as straight forward as I was hoping and the documentation is awful. I figure, if I'm going to have to learn a new system, I might as well go with a better calculator.  I will likely go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-33S-Scientific-Calculator-F2216A/dp/B0000DK6G9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP 33S Scientific Calculator (F2216A)</a>&nbsp;and save this one as a backup for the exam.",2.0
"I had to get this calculator for a professional engineers' exam (it was one of 4 approved calculators to take into the test).  I've been using it to study and HATE how difficult the buttons are to press.  I'm quite speedy on my Texas Instruments TI-82 but this one is painfully rigid.  I originally thought it was a good idea to go with an approved calculator that resembled by TI-82 to most so I wouldn't have to relearn where all the functions are.  Now, I'm second-guessing that decision and hope I'm not too fast on it during the exam so that I don't come up with wrong answers.  My fingers are crossed but I really do not like this calculator so far... if you have a choice, go with another one.",2.0
"If you think getting a TI calculator (or any graphing calc.) will help you get higher grades you are absolutely wrong. Having graduated high school, never once using a graphing calculator, I got all A's in math.  It's not the calculator that does the work its you. A scientific is a) easier to use and b) all you need.

If you're a college student, still it's work ethic, not the calculator that determines your success. But I can understand you now need a graphing calculator, so let me suggest to you the Casio. The Casio calculators are underrated (TIs are overrated x a million) and cheaper and user friendly and equivalent if not better than a TI 83. Don't just get a TI cause everybody else does.",2.0
"Parents: If you're going to buy your child a graphing calculator for school, DON'T insult his/her intelligence with this limited function calculator. Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college. What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs, GREs, AP tests, high school, algebra, calculus 1-3, college, etc...

If you buy a TI-83, you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82, which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.

GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math, but it's a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III. I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3, but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.

For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work:
The TI-83 is a piece of junk. It's for kiddies in 6th grade.

The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.

The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its ""pretty print"" and units system. Plus with the right software mods, you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.

However I realize you're just trying to find info on the TI-83. My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is: don't bother. It's a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86. It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college (Calculus I-III). A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.

It's like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari. It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well. The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum. It can tackle small stuff but will hold its own when the big beasts come around.",2.0
"I am an engineer, working on various algebraic and arithmetic problems frequently during each day. Like most engineers, I have a computer at my desk for doing the tricky stuff (ideally with tools like Mathcad or Mathematica). I thought I would get this calculator for the routine numerical insight stuff. It also remembers to stay in radians when you turn the power off (which many other ""lesser"" calculators don't). What a mistake! Lets say I have just calculated a result. Now I want to find the square root of it. On my trusty old HP-32S at home, I press the ""sqrt"" key. On this calculator I press ""sqrt"" ""2nd"" ""ANS"" "")"" ""ENTER""  (5 keys).

Pros:
-The blue color is very vibrant.
-Mouse pad surface is smooth and my mouse works well with it.

Cons:
-TERRIBLE chemical smell that lingered for months. It came mainly from the wrist support. The smell would also transfer to your wrist and sleeves... It was atrocious.
-Like other reviewers have stated, there is no gel inside. I have not cut it open but it does NOT feel like gel.
-Wrist support has an annoying crinkling sound. I assume it's from the foam that other reviewers have noticed when they cut it open...

Specifically, the ""gel"" padding, which I just learned from another reviewer who cut it open, isn't actually gel, but rather it's foam.  Now maybe this is the reason for it feeling more like a stiff neoprene pad and in my case, encouraging wrist discomfort rather than relieving it.  On a positive note and the reason for the second star is that the mouse tracks very well and the pad is big. In summary, it might be good for others and so be it, but I'm done using it.",2.0

"Didn't last long, only a few months and it came apart. It's now in a landfill somewhere.",2.0
It does not have a pleasant smell and something inside cheaply crinkles when you depress the wrist cushion.,2.0
Good,2.0
Never was comfortable. Hurt my wrist. Stopped using it and went back to a flat black pad.,2.0
"I will be in the minority here, but I was quite disappointed with this product My complaints would probably fit any pad of this style. My discomfort moved from my wrist to my shoulder because of the angle my arm rests at now. I have a pull out shelf for my keyboard and mouse pad and cannot put my hand far enough in to have my wrist correctly on the pad; with this, my hand is too high and often hits the bottom of the desk shelf above my hand, there is not enough room to negotiate easily without repositioning. It also gets dirty from the oils in your skin very quickly. I am going to wash mine and see what happens. I also wear my watch on my right hand and it presses uncomfortably against my wrist. I am going back to a flat mouse pad. The product itself appears to be well made with the exception of the dirt issue on this type of material.",2.0

"The gel was lackluster, after a day I cut it open to see what was up. My gel packet had a massive air pocket in it.",2.0
"I was sure that they wouldn't still be selling bad smelling units, but mine smells REAL bad. I gave it two stars only because if it didn't smell so horrible, it would work just fine.  The smell is currently making me feel nauseous.",2.0
Cover on the hand rest came loose the first day of using the pad,2.0
Keeps hand from getting tired! Works great for me!,2.0
I have an old Belkin mousepad just like this one and that one lasted me for over 10 years. I'm not sure if this is a knockoff or their product just isn't made as nice but this feels really cheap. The nylon has snagged in multiple places after just 1 week of use. The gel pad has lost its support and it's almost as though it deflated into the shape of my hand when my old one always held its shape.,2.0
"The padding inside quickly wore out.  Less than ONE WEEK and now where my wrist wants to lie, there is no cushion at all.  Whatever is inside has seperated or deflated to nothing.  The ""spot"" will not go away.  I had to get my old mouse pad out and pile it on top of this one.

Will not buy again.",2.0
"After about a week, the gel had a permanent deformed groove which wasn't so comfortable.",2.0
The padding isn't very thick and fairly firm. The mousepad I have at work has a thicker rounder pad portion and works well. I will probably try to find something more like that one in the future.,2.0
NOt to good peels very quick.,2.0
They changed how these are made. There's some kind of barrier between the gel and the outer cover and it crackles and doesn't conform to your wrist like the old ones did. I bought a new one because the old one had gotten kind of gross but I'm probably switching back to the old one.,2.0
Too small and it slides around too easily on the desk.,2.0
Ok,2.0
Wrist pad deflates quickly,2.0
"It might be gel, but I would describe it's feel as more like firm foam as opposed to a squishy gel.",2.0
I expected more from a company like Belkin. I have had this mouse pas 2-3 weeks and already the wrist rest is going flat. The divot in in just gets worse. I will probably have to guy a new one or may look into the options to return it.,2.0
"It looks nice and it does provide support for my wrist, but it doesn't fit the shape at all. It feels much more like thick foam padding than gel. They should at least take ""gel"" out of the title of this product.",2.0
This has been a bad experience the palm rest has damp which is also a bit hard... looks like these are all old pieces.,2.0
Good but dipped in center after less than 6 months use.,2.0
"Silver color, was very comfortable but bought a new mouse pad about 8 months later as this just got dirty very fast and wasn't easy to clean.",2.0
"I have been using this pad for about 6 mo and it has started to fall apart.  Right where my wrist rests on the pad, the inner materials are starting to crackle.  Not sure how else to describe that.  At first I didn't know what noise I was hearing but after a few days I realized (as it got louder) that it was the padding within the wrist rest. I would not recommend this product.

Hope this is helpful to someone.",2.0
"My first one like this lasted for years and years and years. After re-doing the office it was coming apart on the pad edges and looked worn (but still worked for mouse control) so I went ahead and bought a new one - same maker, new design and loved it...for a little while...and already on the pad where I use the mouse the most is shiny and not giving me mouse control anymore. I can't hardly use it now and must replace ALREADY!?!

I can't be buying one of these every few months - that's all it lasted. I love the gel wrist support, but not at all happy and not sure what to do now.",2.0
"This printer made a bad first impression on me.  First off, I inserted the CD, and my computer (Dell Pentium III 450 with DVD drive) was unable to read it.  I had to download the driver from the web.  However, even after  installing the driver, I had to look in the appendix of the (so-called)  User's Manual to try to set up the USB connection.  After following  Lexmark's instructions, the printer would not support USB.  I, too, had to  go back to the parallel connection.
After finally getting this thing up  and running, I found the text quality to be very good, and photo quality  (with optional photo cartridge) to be good, not great.  I also found that  the Z51 REALLY grabs the paper out of the automatic paper feeder.  My paper  shredder treats paper more gently.  I also found it difficult to avoid skew  misalignments with this printer.
Shop around.  There have to be better  printers out there for the same price.",2.0
"It arrived on time and in good shape and that's a plus.  Unfortunately when using it I found that the padded end has a tendency at least for me to cut slow down the blood flow to my hand causing a tingling sensation.  Could it be a health problem I don't know about, possibly but I didn't have this problem until I started using this mouse pad.  I swapped ends and put the pad at the far end where my wrist doesn't rest on it and it works fine.",2.0
Over priced and Flimsy !!,2.0
"I had great hopes for this machine.  Immediately I noticed that the first line of the entry always seemed to be in a dark shadow and I had to try tipping the unit to get light into the inner screen to make it readable.  It too often doesn't have the words --- even many very common ones in its database.  The voice is extremely fuzzy when you try the audio pronunciation feature. It only has a few forms of many of the the words I am seeking.  If this unit really has 250,000 words -- as they tell us---then they should create a new one with a couple of million",2.0
"There's no other product out in the market [that i've found] that has both the reputable and quality Franklin Electronics has for a Spanish/English dictionary device. While this product certainly isn't the worst, it's also definitely not the best - and I have it because there's nothing else out there to satisfy my needs.
Because it is a speaking dictionary, we all know the ""computer voice"" is the best we can get. And that is exactly the voice you hear when you press ""SAY"". it's 75% understandable, but who knows the real sound because I understand Spanish in the first place [that's why I bought it].
The first major criticism is the design of the product - instead of it's current rounded look, I would rather have a tilted/slanted look because that's the way most viewers use it [on a flat surface]. The most comfortable viewing angle is 15%, but this product is at almost a flat angle so that whenever you type or read the first line, it's blocked by a shadow from the top on the LCD.
Also, while the buttons are rubberized for easy feel, they should be bigger [seeing how there is so much space inbetween each button] and raised higher, thus making it easier to push. The location of the keys are standard, okay for learning.
I wish there was a Spanish/English phrase compatibility function where you are able to type in short phrases like ""How are you"" or ""Where is the telephone"" instead of just one word definitions. This would make the device so much better! I don't think the conjugations of phrasing the sentences really matter so long as you get the gist of the phrase meaning.
Overall, I would only buy this if you really need something handy [that speaks] for going on business trips or such. There is no need to buy it if you are a student and just need definitions, get the cheaper version for half the price.",2.0
I can tell the gel portion your wrist rests on is going to burst open.  Only had it a few months.,2.0
"It was too small and the wrist pad was pretty not squishy. We got rid of it. On the plus side, no purchasing issues and it arrived when promised.",2.0
Product opened up where you rest your wrist or it would have been perfect.,2.0
"It is not as effective as described.  It is cut with curves that should not have been cut, therefore one loses space needed.
It is a brand new item and it yet it has a look as though it is soiled.  Ironic because when I took it out of the package it looked brand new,
however, it quickly started looking (within 2 to 3 days) as if it was sully.  The gel is very flat and does not support the wrist at all which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. I would look else where if one is needed.",2.0
the imprint from your wrest stays in the pad. re-positioning can be uncomforable,2.0
"I ordered ths mouse pad with wrist rest to replace my old one. The gel in the old one was getting compressed and pad was wearing out.  This pad is a nice size with plenty of room to move the mouse around. The bottom of the pad is rubber so that it grips the desk and does not slide around. The top surface of the mouse pad has a smooth surface to allow the mouse to move around easily.

The wrist rest is a nice size and has an indentation to cradle your wrist or end of palm which is really nice. However the material inside is not very soft, with no give when you rest your wrist upon it. I am a large guy, not dainty wrists here, so the material is pretty stiff. It also makes a crunchy sound kind of like styro foam or plastic sheeting.

Overall I am not happy with the product and find my old worn out pad more comfortable and forgiving. The problem is this mouse pad comes in blister packaging, so you have to cut it apart to remove the item, therefore leaving you unable to return it.",2.0
"Has lost a lot of support, and I have it less than 6 months.",2.0
"Bought this product to replace my Belkin Mouse pad that was years old and torn up.  Definitely not the same quality as it used to be.  The wrist rest is not the same gel as it used to be made with, and feels like poor quality these days.  I would shop elsewhere and find a pad with softer wrist rest, as Belkin seems to be cutting quality out.  It's okay, but not comfortable like it used to be.",2.0
"I liked this until the fabric at the bottom started turning up and peeling away from the bottom left. I bought this on February 19, 2016. It should have lasted longer than 5 months w/o the fabric pulling away from the rubber part. I like the way if feels and cushions my wrist, but the quality of the covering is just not there. (or use better glue!)",2.0
Not very good as mouse doesn't work all that well with it and my 5 year old one was better.,2.0
"Wrist rest is extra wide and comfortable, but squeezing it clearly shows that it is not gel (as other reviews have mentioned). Mouse pad is plenty big and very smooth. There is a smell when I first opened it, but I couldn't smell it after an hour unless I held it up to my face.",2.0
"I bought this to help out with carpal tunnel syndrome.
I still have issues and after a month the material covering it has fallen off the wrist rest",2.0
Not comfortable at all for me.  I guess I'm used to my slanted mouse pad.  I turned it around and now my son is using it backwards because he didn't like it either.,2.0
Not such great quality.  Hard to clean and it didn't hold up as well as it should have.  Mouse pad area far too small.,2.0
I much prefer the pleather wrist rests made by a competitor. Using this at work still. Color is nice,2.0
"The wrist rest cave's in after a very short while and it then serves no purpose. I have purchased several of these from different companies hoping that would not occur but I have not found one that does not do it. So sad when it is the very reason you buy one of these Mouse pads to start with

"I have a job that requires 8 plus hours of computer use a day.  Recently, I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel, Radial Tunnel, and Ulnar Nerve (I think the term was ulcerations) in both arms.  I was in a bit of a panic when I bought this pad, so at the time I was looking for anything that would be helpful.  Purchasing this to use as a support for my right wrist was a mistake.  When I rested my wrist on the pad it made the pain worse because it pushed directly on some of the problem spots.  If you are dealing with similar medical issues, I strongly recommend purchasing a wrist brace like the one linked here:

https://www.amazon.com/Support-Adjustable-Breathable-Arthritis-Tendinitis/dp/B00IJJXS4O/ref=sr_1_7_s_it?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1468185105&sr=1-7

"I use my computer a LOT, sometimes 12-18 hours a day when busy with graphics work. I started getting sore between by thumb and wrist, where my hand rested on my desk, so I tried this pad. It worked GREAT at first -- but then the 'gel' pad (I think it is actually foam) started to flatten out and get hard. Now it's not any better than the desk. Good product, but it doesn't last!",2.0
"While toner appears to be Canon, it is not dark enough as the original toner was.  I have to put copier on manual",2.0

Nice and comfortable but for some reason with my laser mouse it will not move up or down... Move the mouse off of the pad and it works fine..  Strange and useless for me.,2.0
These are not like the original.  They seem cheaper made and don't use gel anymore.  In fact the Belkin logo doesn't even look like the picture and is tilted..  Wondering if these are cheap knock offs of the original.,2.0
hate this piece of sh**. If you are playing games or anything like that Get a larger mouse pad. If your just needing one for daily web use than its ok but i personally just don't like the size or cushion its annoying to me.,2.0
"Very strong chemical smell from the wrist pad. Aired it outside for a few days and then inside for a few weeks before I could use it. To me, this is a very major drawback.  Comfort seems ok.",2.0
"The wrist rest is in no way ""gel filled"" as you may think! I have a 10 year old version of this that ""is gel filled"" and is still very soft and usable. I thought I was getting the same thing but apparently the quality has diminished over the years to cut manufacturing costs! Feels more like a piece of cheap foam, and from what I've seen posted by others on here and various sites that is exactly what the ""gel"" is. I'm not bothering to send back as it will cost more in shipping than what I paid for one... I'm in no way faulting Amazon for this just the manufacturer, it even says ""gel"" on the manufacturer's packaging. A gel brick maybe!",2.0
pad area is too small.  I won't use it.,2.0
"I have owned the silver/grey mouse pad for the last 10 years and it's time to change it up. I ordered the cheapo blue one. It's very cheap. The pad is not made out of gel, it's got some sort of springy foam material that crinkles when you move your wrist. Yes, it actually makes noise.

I am returning this blue one and getting the more expensive silver version. I hope it's the same one that I am used to or it will get sent back too.",2.0
"The ""gel"" is this pad is quite disappointing if it is really gel at all that is. I was quite uncomfortable using this pad and revert back to my old one within a week.",2.0
Very flimsy and makes the mouse stick.,2.0
Cloth covering the padded backing began to separate (peel away) after only a week or two.,2.0
I didn't like the mouse pad. I am using a mouse pad at work which is curved but this one is sunken at the center. It is uncomfortable to use because it gives me a feeling that product has reached its end of life. I will try it for couple of days before returning.,2.0
Not a gel. More like foam that  permanently  compresses where your wrist was.,2.0
"The gel pad is way too rigid and way too high. I can't use it. But for this price, I don't bother returning.",2.0
You can hear the plastic inside the gel mouse. Annoying and sounds cheap.,2.0
Wrist pad has already sunken in within first couple weeks.,2.0
"You get what you pay for. It's not bad, but I am buying a new one. When you rest your wrist on the ""gel"" part it sounds like a plastic bag crinkling inside. Very hard and not very comfortable for my wrist.",2.0
I purchased this for my boss and he didn't like it so he through it in a drawer. I just started using it about a month ago and it's indented already.,2.0
It feels nothing like a gel mouse pad it feels like some sought of hard foam. I was hoping for something soft and comforting for my wrist instead I got a brick. The Pad it self is nice tho its just the wrist rest that sucks.,2.0
"I was hoping this is the one that's perpetually sticky on the bottom, but this one isn't. I returned it to a local retailer who was happy to return it without a receipt, and even though they couldn't find it in his system.",2.0

The Bad: The wrist support collapsed after 40 days of use.",2.0
Pad is very thin and wrist rest isn't that great.,2.0
the arm rest feels really high.. never really used this,2.0
"I would not recommend this product due to the fact that it's not ergonomic. It forces you to bend your hand in order to reach your mouse and move it around. Over time, I feel that the cushion the pad was not comfortable, as a matter of fact, it made the whole thing even more uncomfortable the my old flat pad.",2.0
The wrist support was way too thick for me.  Going to have to re-gift this and buy a new one with a less tall wrist support.,2.0
Crap. Not supportive to the wrist at all.,2.0
"Product appeared to be well used or abused. Batteries ran down very quickly. Was very careful with sticky on/off button. No instructions. Not previous owners fault.

Anybody have one?",2.0
I must say that after all the great reviews I was a little let down by the Franklin Electronic Dictionary. I bought it so that I could read in bed and check out all those new words without having to lug around my very heavy dictionary. Of the first 20 or so words I keyed in approximately 12 were not in there. Since then this has been quite a regular pattern. I found the games either too simple or that they too often used proper names. So it is back to the book for this boy until a better version is offered. Perhaps electronics aren't taking over the world after all!,2.0
"I bought the silver mouse pad. It is very comfortable, and I really like the gel support.  It doesn't work with my mouse, the Logitech M705.  It seems a little ridiculous to me to make a mouse pad that doesn't work with some mice.",2.0
I've had this for 2 months and it's already coming apart! The top cloth has separated and bubbled!,2.0
"Comfortable, sure, but the surface is too reflective (I think) for my wireless mouse. The cursor jumps around. Works with my wired mouse even though it's also a laser mouse. However, I never use this mouse...so it's useless to me.",2.0

Mouse was working very well for the first month and then it started left clicking on its own and completely go out from time to time,2.0
"The gel pad is hard as a rock. Otherwise fine for the price. Disappointing, but it is too cheap to bother returning.",2.0
The pad is separating from the rubber mat right at the base of the wrist rest.  I've only been using this for a month.  Look for slightly better quality if you care.  The gel rest is comfortable though and it works well enough.,2.0
Well it did last a few days before the wrist support totally collapsed. Now it has a big dent in the wrist support and provides very little support. I have had several wrist supports but never had one collapse like this. Update 2 years later totally trashed.,2.0
"the mouse service is fine, but the wrist rest actually makes my wrist hurt.  I had CTS surgery on both wrists three years ago and have had to use a mouse pad with a wrist rest since.  The one I had just finally wore out.  It had a hard surface instead of gel.  I think this one gives too much for me and I'll be looking for one like I had before. :(",2.0
"Pad is smooth and comfortable to use, but my Microsoft Intellimouse only works in one direction due to the weave of the material.  When the mouse is off angle it fails to pick up the motion.  I had an earlier generation Belkin Gel pad that worked great for many years and never had this issue.",2.0
"I thought this one was different than the one I bought at Office Depot, but it is the same...the older ones made by this company were much better than the new ones are. The padding where you put your wrist dents in pretty fast and stays dented it does not spring back, so in the end is very uncomfortable. I bought but did not return; would have if I would of had the time to do so; so not worth the money.",2.0
the gel wrist area became lopsided quickly,2.0
"My experience with this mouse pad has not been a good one. I find the wrist support to be too firm, and not comfortable at all.  Also, I don't like the length of the pad.  With the wrist support taking up a portion of the length, the usable space is too small.  Maybe it's just me, but I tend to run out of pad when I'm scrolling. I have to stop scrolling and pick up the mouse and move it to continue scrolling. I'm glad I didn't throw my old mouse pad away. I had to go back to using it till I can find a suitable replacement. This one went in the trash, it wasn't worth the cost to return it.",2.0
I don't like how this sinks in the middle of the wrist pad area.  I feel that dip actually causes more pressure on my skin at the wrist area.  Would recommend getting one that doesn't have a dip at that location.,2.0
"Center of the gel pad is weak. This part should have the most bolstering, not the least. Also, as some people have said, it is smelly. Not from a distance but the smell will get on your hands. So it might be cheap, but its not a great purchase decision. Disappointed",2.0
Not GEL,2.0

Sometimes you can remove the software and then reload it to get the scanner  to work. If you are lucky and it starts you had better do all your scanning  as it may not work once you have gone to a different application and try  again to use it.

Didn't like how flimsy and soft it is. Left in inside my computer bag and the edges got bent. Ok if you're just leaving it on your desk all the time.,2.0
Had this for only about 60 days and have already had to reattach the fabric to the base twice. It comes unglued with just normal use. Surely it should last longer than two months before falling apart.,2.0
feels and looks cheap. The silver color stained very quickly.,2.0
Poor quality foam. Does not hold it's shape and provides poor support. I would not buy it again.,2.0
"This mousepad works well.....at first. It's been just over a month and the seam where the gel/foam pad ends is splitting apart. I stand at a terminal and use the computer 5-6 days a week, 9 hours a day. My wrist was hurting before I got this pad and a brace. Used the two together for a few weeks and then stopped wearing the brace, and my wrist does not hurt any more. kept using the pad, but now it's coming apart. Very disappointing.  Guess you get what you pay for.",2.0
Mouse pad is not the same dimensions as listed. The fabric causes my mouse to stutter. The gel does not feel to good.,2.0
The gel portion is wayyy too firm.,2.0
The foam pad your wrist goes on ended up collapsing in on itself after a month of use. This was on my home computer with only a couple hours of use every day. I would probably get something else if you want something more durable that will last longer.,2.0
"I bought this just to try Belkin, I didn't like it. You get what you pay for. Low quality fabric on top, the inner material is covered with some plastic bag or smt. it makes sounds when you put your wrist a little bit faster than usual. If you are looking for a cheaper solution, try this. But I wouldn't choose this mouse pad at the first place.",2.0
not comfortable to use and my mouse (which I ordered with the pad and was a recommendation) doesn't glide well.  I had to go back to traditional mouse pad.,2.0
After a couple uses the gel pad became permanently indented; wouldn't recommend buying this product.,2.0
Weak. Used it for around  20 hours and already squished in half. Not for heavy use.,2.0
this product has weird odor,2.0
"As other reviews have mentioned, Belkin gas changed the quality of this product. I bought one of these many years ago (and I love it). I just bought a new one and it doesn't feel the same at all. The pad doesn't feel like it has gel in it, but rather some kind of foam. It's lighter weight and just not as comfortable. I wouldn't say it's horrible, but since I have one of their older versions that's significantly better, I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of the new one.",2.0
"I have an older one of these at work that is great but the new versions not so much. The ""depression"" area where the Gel is suppose to be to rest the wrist (where most carpal tunnel starts) is almost non existent on these, the ""depression"" for your wrist is almost unsupported and seems like most of the ""gel"" is on the two ends. The middle is not very soft, save your $.",2.0
"Has a really loud crinkle sound on the ""gel"" part of the pad.",2.0
The gel inside started to make a crunching noise after a few days of use.  I have another of this same model that is a few years old and is still noiseless and comfy despite being almost worn out.,2.0
I have bought 4 mouse pads from Amazon so far ad this was the worst. The support on the wrist is very poor and the texture on the pad is not durable either.,2.0
"This is a comfortable mouse pad with wrist rest. If you don't have a lot of space, it works well. I bought it specifically because it fit my keyboard tray. After about 6 months of use, though, the fabric covering has completely come off the wrist rest. It's not unusable, just very annoying.",2.0
"I bought this for work to replace my worn out one, but the one I had, had more padding so just kept this one for my house. It's very flat and not that great if you have trouble with your wrists.",2.0
I was replacing an old belkin waverest mouse pad with this one. Its been a few years so it was time. They must make them differently now. The wrist rest was extremely uncomfortable and gave me pain in my arm. I had to switch back to my old one. This is just sitting on my desk gathering dust now. I'll be buying a different one in the oval shape with hopefully a better wrist rest on it like my old ones have always had. Not sure what rock material this is made of now. It sucks.,2.0
"I like the model and the feels of the pad, it's great. The downside of it is that its doesnt last long. This is the second day in using it and the pad won't sponged back up. Maybe my hand pressed it to hard while playing game? and I notice that the top layer is already open up (it wasn't sticking to the bottom layer) Other than that everything is fine, but you know i was expecting it to last longer",2.0
It serves its purpose.,2.0
"I owned this product about 5 years ago and it was very nice quality.  Now,  it's not comfortable because it isn't soft enough at the wrist.  It is creating a pressure point instead of comfort.  Whole thing is of lesser quality so I am disappointed and wish I hadn't bothered.",2.0

You would think the company could find some way to fix that problem. It is supposedly laminated but it was so thin that it didn't offer enough protection for me. I took it in and had it laminated at an office shop and it is much better now, although it cost me an extra $16 to have it done. Without the extra lamination I doubt that it would have lasted long, as it was very flimsy. I love that it shows all the national parks, that was my main requirement.",3.0

Didn't really like the lamination. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you were thinking about framing for display. The irregular size needs to be custom framed and the cost isn't worth it. Its very nice if you're not planning to frame it,3.0

"This is difficult to rate because the map itself is beautiful! Unfortunately, as other customers have stated, the rolling and packaging of the map are not adequate to protect from creases.

The replacement map is better, but still has 7 large (5-7 in) creases and 7 smaller creases across the entire map. Although the creases are most noticeable on the back of the map, several do show through to the front.  The map was not sent in a tube but was somewhat secure in a long box. I chose to keep the second map and deal with the creases, but am disappointed with the overall purchase.

I was disappointed the condition I received this in. It shipped in a tube which was great and SHOULD have prevented wrinkles/creases but when I opened it up there were several creases in the map and the top had several small rips across it. I needed it for that weekend so I could not return it but I would not recommend buying from this company. I was hoping that the other reviews were wrong but they are not...this will come damaged in some form!,3.0
The information on this map is good.  However the colors of the states are dark which does not contrast well with the black letters.  I have to move very close to the map to read the state capitals and other points of interest.  The lamination is good so it should stand the test of time.,3.0
"We ordered the 'Enlarged Tubed' map.

First, this Amazon listing is very confusing because it says that the map is laminated, but depending on what size you pick it really isn't. (Even though the 'Traditional' and the 'Enlarged' are the same size, only one comes laminated.) Very deceiving since the comments here say the same for all maps, and mention that it is laminated.

When we got the map in the shipping tube, as soon as we pulled it out, we noticed the ends had crumpled and that the middle had to crinkle marks that are across the whole map. Not sure if this is from shipping (since the tube was in fine shape), or from when the map was rolled with the shipping paper.

The map itself is a beautiful print with great detail and is the only reason we're keeping it.

Overall slightly disappointed. The laminating thing we could have noticed when ordering, but never really looked since the comments said laminated, but are apparently for both types of map. There probably should be two separate listings for this product. Guess it shows that we should only buy from places where the description is really detailed.",3.0

"Factually wrong - People's Republic of China is not distinguished from the Republic of China.

"L.s.

I am interested in a large word map and will have to mount it on the wall. Many times sellers do not provide the dimensions of their maps. Other times it does not make sense to me. E.g. I cannot visualize a word map of 50*2.5*.8 inches.
Another consideration is the fact that plywood is usually 4 feet wide, would it not be nice to make maps that are 44"" wide. That would facilitate the mounting.
Some suggestions on how to glue a map in particular the laminated ones would be very helpful.
Thank you for considering my observations.

"The ""Traditional"" that is sold by Amazon *IS* laminated, but it is $48 which makes it steep for a map without a frame.

The ""basic size"" and ""enlarged tubed"" that are sold by PosterRevolution are NOT laminated (I contacted them on 12/29/13 and they confirmed this).  Their large size is $28 which is very steep for a non-laminated piece of paper.

Maps, Globes, and More advertised the ""enlarged tubed"" as having ""laminated paper,"" but they shipped me a non-laminated map.  Had I not taken a screen shot of their description at the time I ordered it, I would have had to pay for return shipping out of my own pocket.  Be aware that no one is selling a laminated version of the ""enlarged tubed"" map anymore.

The laminated 48x73 map is AWESOME -- I've received tons of compliments on it and refer to it often.  I had some leftover baseboard from my house renovation that I spray painted Dark Walnut and used to frame this map.....great way to dress a huge blank wall.",3.0
The printed map is a fabulous size and a good value. The tube the map shipped in was 2 pieces taped at the center; the map was received wrinkled in the center. The company sent a second map and we didn't even have to return the first. The second map was shipped exactly the same and was received wrinkled again in the center. Disappointing.,3.0

"It is a very nice map and not too large to fit on our wall.
However, it has several pleats in it.  We anticipated it coming in a nice round tube that would
keep it from being creased but unfortunately it has creases about every 2 or 3 inches and won't lay flat.
Next time maybe ship it in a tube with a larger circumference so it doesn't have to be folded so much.",3.0
The laminate is so thin that it ripped when we were trying to hang it on the wall with stick pins.  We had to re-enforce the corners with duck tape.  The map itself is great!,3.0
Arrived on time and in the tube undamaged. The only issue was the size of the the type on the map. The bottom 1/2 of it and the western 1/3 is all ocean. I guess it is proportional to the actual ocean coverage but it made the print in North America almost impossible to read and could have been expanded a little more by having less ocean. Not good for a wall map as I had it but you can still learn from it with glasses.,3.0

The creases in the map look like they are just short of the map being folded and put in a flat box.

It was delivered in the box rolled up, but it was obvious from the deep regular creases in the lamination that it had been folded and stored flat.  While I was able to iron it flat, the creases left by the fold are still vary obvious and spoil the beauty of the map.",3.0
The book is very short and full of cute pictures. I would only recommended this book to someone who doesn't have a ferret and isn't planning on getting one  but would like to know more about ferrets. I read this book shortly after I got my first ferret and it did not help me at all and left me more confused. I highly recommend the book Ferrets for Dummies for those who are interested in getting a ferret. That book is a lot longer and was a million times more helpful to me than this book ever was.,3.0
Being a rather new ferret owner I thought that getting a book to learn even more about ferrets.

Ferrets for Dummies seems to be good even though I only read that trial on my Kindle (after I purchased this book).,3.0
Conceptually this book is OK.  I got it for a 10-year-old and he is probably likely to get past any useful information very quickly.  The equipment shown and explained is primitive and more on a toy level.  I am sending him a high school student-grade scope that has many features not covered.  I also purchased another book for him which is a bit more detailed and has Internet information available.  Hopefully that will prove to be a more challenging guide.,3.0

"I really was excited to get this planner and started filling it in right away (the size was GREAT for me b/c all the school papers, etc. fit right in without folding and stuffing).  It's just the size of a regular binder.  THEN I noticed the two-sided printing was just not done the best way!  The backside should be reversed so that when you're flipping through the months you don't have to completely turn the notebook around.  Same goes for flipping through the weeks.  This would be so much more efficient, and the problem annoyed me so much that I'm having to make my own copies DONE THE RIGHT WAY.  I guess you could always order refills, but I would honestly be using one side of the papers.  I don't want to have to flip all of them over at the end of the year either -- just want them all in order, flipped appropriately so I can use both sides.  Or hey, I don't mind using one side, but they need to give me 52 pages of ""weeks"" and 12 pages of ""months.""  There are not enough pages as it exists now to use it ""one-sided.""

"This atlas is well put together and fairly detailed.  When I ordered this, I was thinking that this would show all those minor local dirt roads that do not appear on regular maps.  However, there are simply not very many roads in Alaska.  If you're planning a road trip, even the less detailed maps will show most of the roads.  So, if you're planning a road trip into Alaska, this map's scale is too big to be used for high-level planning, and perhaps not detailed enough to backpackers or other users.

However, a surprising amount of that is taken up by a list of landmarks and their coordinates on the map.  This is partly because this map doesn't put the end of the Aleutian chain in a box at the bottom, but shows them in their actual location.

"I've had daycare kids use these forever and love them. BUT, ours only worked for a couple weeks...new battery, should be fine, but no go. It has power and will go through the functions, but not count up.",3.0
"I ordered two of these because my children each wanted a different color. (The bookmarks happened to come from different sellers; I didn't realize they would come from two different sellers.) The pink one were ordered worked properly. The purple one was defective. (It just didn't work; I removed the battery several times and tried tinkering with it, but the numbers just kept flashing like crazy all over the screen.) Returning was a pain because the item was from a third-party seller. I ordered a replacement (this time a blue one, instead of purple), but have not received it yet. I'm really hoping it works. So, buyer beware...the product itself is neat and I think my kids will like using their bookmarks, but quality control on this product doesn't seem great. It also seems overpriced for what it is.",3.0
Complicated to get the timer started when my son needed to read. Once we figured it out it was good.,3.0
"This is a great invention!  However, after only a few weeks of very light use, the timer has broken.  I wish I could give it a five star rating, but 3 is the best I can give as it isn't durable.  My kids are required to read at least 20 minutes per night and it's the best thing ever for them to keep track of their reading minutes!",3.0
I'm not sure about this product yet as it arrived and doesn't work. I'm hoping that it is only a dead battery otherwise I will be returning this item.,3.0
"It's a cute little timer, of good use and design. However, Amazon sent me the wrong color! I ordered for the neon blue one but they sent me the purple, two days after the due delivery time . It's 0.4 dollar cheaper than the blue and not one of my favorite colors. But it would be a greater hassle and waste of time if sent back for a change due to this color issue. Conclusion: It's a decent product, but the service need to be improved badly.",3.0
"It's a little difficult to use.  Buttons don't always work.  Also, the battery for both I bought was dead, so I had to pay $3 each for another one.",3.0
Just plan on having at least one of the LR1130 batteries on hand if you purchase this item. I had a very disappointed child when I opened and couldn't get it to work. Had to wait another day to get a battery.,3.0
"This is a great idea in theory, but my son doesn't actually use it that often. The bookmark is a little thick for your typical elementary school paperback and therefore falls out easily if you're not deliberate about how you carry the book.",3.0
"Great idea, but it has some quality control issues.  I purchased two of these (one in red and one in blue) and the red one has been just fine.  However, the blue one has been finicky since day one...although I am sure the color has nothing to do with it ;-)  We have had to re-seat the battery a few times (per the manufacturer's instructions on their website) when the screen has gone blank.  I agree with another reviewer who said that the start/stop button needs to be pressed ""just so"" or else it may or may not start/stop.  I wonder if the repeated pressing of the start/stop button in order to make it work properly somehow affects the working mechanism...especially with kids thinking they have to press the button harder to make it work.  The next time we see a blank screen, I intend to request a replacement from the manufacturer.  If that happens, I will update this review to reflect how the company handles this concern.",3.0
"I bought one of these for my daughter (13) & one for me. My daughter doesn't like using hers, but I like keeping track of my reading per day & how long it takes to complete each book that I read. I don't know why, I'm just strange like that! Anyway, the bookmark seems to be pretty durable because I read on my front porch quite a bit and it has fallen onto the concrete several times and has not cracked or appear damaged in any way. The only complaint I have is that the start/stop button is finicky. You have to push it just right or it doesn't obey. Sometimes I think it's on, but it's not or vice-versa.",3.0

"While I did find this calendar to be cute, I felt that too many of the stickers in it pertained to the first year, like using utensils, drinking from a cup, running well, climbing stairs, saying no, throwing and kicking a ball, etc. If you can't find a different one, I would still recommend this one since it still helps to have a calendar specifically for the second year. It helps me to remember to jot cute things my daughter does regularly. I do like that each month has a place for a picture and a place for height and weight. I haven't had time to put pics in, but I can add them later.",3.0
"Having just completed my daughter's first year calendar which thoughtfully includes 13 months to cover both birthdays, I was disappointed to find that this second year calendar only has 12 calendar pages. Since my daughter's birthday is on the 16th, this means that I have to start her second year on my old calendar and then move it over to the new one once the month changes. 13 months would have been nice. Other than that, the calendar is cute, and I like that it is spiral bound.",3.0

"doesn't fit with the second edition which is the one for sale now. The pages they tell you to put the tabs on matches up with the really old edition.

"I bought these for an RCIA class using the catechism prepared following the second Vatican ecmenical council. These tabs apparently match back to an older edition, with page numbers to match. I was still able to use most of them, by finding the page references myself but they are not a perfect match. The tabs themselves are good quality and application was fairly easy, but I might recommend finding an updated set if you plan to use the current catechism, unless you want to spend a lot of time searching and guessing which goes where.",3.0
I was very disappointed as there was missing tabs for some chapters in the bible so I would not recomend this item,3.0

"If you are a total Zentangle fan and can't get enough of it or a CZT (Certified Zentangle Trainer), you will most likely like this book. It is very lovely to look at and artistic. The first section tells the story of how Rick and Maria met and came to the place in their lives that they needed to be in order to create Zentangle.
Unfortunately, I was looking for a book that gave some instruction on how to create Zentangle drawings, and there is none of that in here. A few suggestions and ideas, but pretty much any time the book came close to giving an actual instruction it halts the thought and refers you to either their beginner kit or a class taught by a CZT. In fact, several parts of the book sound like an infomercial.
If you want a book with ideas on how to actually create Zentangles, look else where (or take a class). If you want a lovely book for your students to look at during the class, then this may be a better fit for you.",3.0

"I received my password organizer today.  I like the book for the most part.  I like the spiral binding, the cover with my name (I did not add a title), the  large print, the fact that it lays flat. These are things that I was looking for in an organizer; however, I found the format to be annoying.  1. You have this box with the dark frame, however, your website name is outside the frame.  2. The username is before the email address.  When you go to the website you always have to enter the web address before you can enter a username.  3.  It would have been better if the tabs only had one letter instead of two at a time.  Even though there are a few things that I do not like about the book, I would order it again.

It just isn't quite what it should be.",3.0

Like it overall but inside of leather has cuts and is peeling alot smaller than pics make it look,3.0
Its a good product if you need assisting in prioritizing things. I'm not really sure that the pomodoros are helpful but perhaps my issue is more work load being overwhelming rather than being unable to do it.,3.0
"It's beautiful to hold and look at. I felt very productive the first two days. But now, I then I've found I could waste half a day deciding what to make my priority task. Then If you have twenty different minors tasks, and there's only space for 5 max, it gets very debilitating to figure out what to do and what to prioritize. Whereas on certain days, when I have a notepad and just list a bunch of things to do without prioritizing, I actually got a majority of them done. So I'm stuck... This is useful in some respects, if you have cut and dry things to achieve, but if you have 5 projects going on at once, you can get stuck on how to use this planner.

Also, if you are a creative writer using the pomodoro method, you're definitely able to account for time put in toward your project/writing, but then your work feels more efficient but soulless and less juicy, like with moments of brilliance you get when you've lost complete track of time.",3.0
"Received as a gift and I mostly enjoy using it.  So far I see one unexpected great feature and one surprising miss.

Plus: The intro is a really good distillation of some proven strategies for getting stuff done. I expected to skim it and pull out any quick tips on using the planner but there was some good advice. I like how it gets you to focus on the big picture by paradoxically breaking things down into smaller items and prompts you to recognize the small and big wins along the way.

Negative: Quite disappointed that it only has pages for 5 days a week. Very often we have projects, events to tackle over the weekend. But even if there isn't ""work"" to be done, these techniques are equally applicable to domestic projects, chores, errands, and even recreation. It makes no sense to me unless they were targeting a specific page count and couldn't make cuts elsewhere.",3.0
Will respond after these are opened on Christmas morning.  I did not remove the wrapping they came in so I did not inspect the planners.,3.0
Very nice planner. Only thing is that its just not for me personally. I think it lost me when you have to fill in bubbles of how long it took to accomplish each task. It may work for some people. Just not me. I won't be using it after one week ;(,3.0
"I ordered the Panda Planner and thought it was overkill. And my Panda disintegrated after a few weeks of use so I returned it and got this one instead. It's actually not a bad little planner. It relies on the Pomodoro technique which involves doing ""Sprints"" of work, taking a five minute break, and doing another ""Sprint.""

So why three stars? Because it's expensive for what you get. You can probably find the exact same planner layout online, or at least something similar, and print out 365 sheets for about $3 in paper and ink costs. Throw it in a three ring binder and you're set for a fraction of the price, if you don't mind a little added bulk. Another issue: this won't last the entire year. Try it if you must but I'd go the free route of printing out planner sheets and putting them in a binder",3.0

"I purchased this planner for my sister as Christmas gift. The planner is well made on the whole but the elastic cord for keeping the planner closed is cheaply made. Within two months of using the planner, the cord came off from one end leaving an awkward hole on back of the planner. We decided to snip the other end off. It would be great if the planner comes without the cord. The seller was not very responsive to feedback emails, only replying to one out of two emails. The second reply never came after more than four days.",3.0
"I like the idea of structuring things with the pomodoro technique, however there are many things that the pomodoro technique is not useful for (phone calls & meetings, for instance).
I like the idea of ""do the most important thing first"" and structuring the to-do list that way. However, it is often not possible to do the most important thing first. Often the most important thing may be a 4pm appointment and you're going to need to do a bunch of less important things beforehand. In practice, this system did not work for me.
Also, there are only 5 days per week! What am I supposed to do with Saturday and Sunday??? This planner did not fit my needs at all and was expensive to boot. An unfortunate waste of money.",3.0
"I would have given it five stars except for two reasons;

1.  It's only a five day week!  What were you guys thinking?  Some of us work 7 days...where are we supposed to put Sat & Sundays?

2.  Action Day Planner has ribbons that can be used to mark certain pages.  You should have added one so that we could mark the tasks for the week page to make it easy to flip back to on the fly

If those were done this would have been a slam dunk five.  Maybe you can put it in the planner for next year. ;)",3.0
"The art is really nice, and the pictures are all nature themes, which I like.  The paper is a nice thick stock, and there are a lot of pictures to choose from.

On the downside, the pages aren't perforated, which makes it hard to hang anything you like... and frankly it's a bit hard to get to the pages while they're in the binding.  The pictures are also on both sides of the page, which means you have to choose which side to hang.  Also, the picture from the other side can bleed through, especially if you use markers instead of colored pencils.  Also, if you're above the age of 35, reading glasses might be required...

Derwent Inktense are my fave pencils.  But they're a bit spendy and best for use with water.  I only had a couple of their Coloursoft line so thought this was a good chance to try some more and oh, yes color too!  The pencils are a great quality that I would expect from Derwent.

The book?  Gotta admit it's a bit of a disappointment.  The paper is okay but you're really going to be limited to the pencils, especially given the fact their are prints on both sides of the page (so if you like to use coloring pages in craft projects, this one is probably not ideal).  The pages are also not perforated so again, best for use in the book.  While there are some winning designs that take up the page there are also some that leave a lot of white space or feel like they threw random elements together just to fill space.  Several pages fill like both filler and an attempt to turn it into more of an ""Activity book"" (see.  The Rabbit page  that is repeated with some elements removed and instructions for you to dress the rabbit who is not missing his tie and hat).  One of the things I like about adult coloring books is that they're just coloring books.  So find the insects pages aren't really what I was hoping for.

That said there are some perfectly lovely pages.  I'd put it as average overall.  Some winning pages, some not so much.  Okay paper but nothing exceptional.",3.0
"I gave this 3 stars which Amazon rates as 'It's Okay' which is exactly how I feel about this book.  I was actually disappointed with it.  On the positive size, it's bright white, heavyweight paper and interesting drawings inside.  They definitely have a theme and there is a mix of complex and simple drawings.  On the negative, I expected a smoother paper that felt more expensive.  This book is a lot more money than most coloring books and I expected the finest quality. The cover is extremely high quality but not the inside paper.  I don't mind that it's 2 sided because I think it was primarily intended for use with colored pencils and it's clear it's 2 sided before you buy it.  I like the smaller fineline drawings but the drawings with the heavy lines are less traditional and frankly I just don't find them as appealing.  Their slight awkwardness of line may appeal to some because they are different than other coloring books but I prefer a smooth even line.",3.0
"I don't like this as well as I thought I would.  The illustrations have a lot of bolder black lines that, to me, take away from the intricate detail of coloring.  It's printed on both sides of the paper.  Though the paper is fairly thick (and accepts watercolor pencils), there's still bleed-through with markers and some pens.  It's not a bad coloring book, certainly not the worst I've seen, but not quite what I was hoping for.",3.0
"PROS:

"Not here because of the podcast, not very familiar with Mr. Dumas actually, but wasn't too blown away with this journal. Felt to me like a lot of ""getting ready to get ready"". For the price, I definitely expected something more ground-breaking in terms of efficiency and productivity. All you're really doing is listing what you'll do for four ""blocks"" of the day, and then rating how efficient you were. My question is, if you're putting in 10-14 hour days, is each block 3-4 hours? He suggests that each block is an hour, so then you're only working a four hour day? Considering this book has a assumably large audience in entrepreneurs, I can't imagine many of them do 4 hour days. The other thing, why can't I plan out my week? Where's the weekly goal list? Where's the daily goal list? The monthly and yearly goal list? I find for me, just using the free ""Notes"" app on my phone is effective enough, planning out my day and using the Pomodoro app for efficiency. The book itself is very well made though, and is quite beautiful, and I admire Mr. Dumas for his efforts, I just don't see the value in it.",3.0
"The concept is wonderful, but the pages are so cluttered with print that I do not like it.  I've only used it for a couple of days and I'm going back to another planner.  I tried using a colored pen to make it stand out from the print, but that didn't help much. If they change the format of the pages, I may reconsider purchasing it again in the future.

"My daughter would give these a five star, I am sure of it. She was so excited to receive them. She immediately opened them to smell with me, but I found it hard to distinguish more than just a sweet scent from some of them. She assures me that each smell is unique though. They do write well and the glitter is definitely easy to see. I think after a month of coloring though the are starting to be used up. For the price, I think you could probably find a nicer set if you were willing to sacrifice the whole smell thing.",3.0
"the gel pens themselves work good, but the smell was very light and weak unless you have the pens almost in your nose you really cant smell them and when you can its such a light weak smell.

"I got the totally taffy pens, and was unsure if I would like them or not. I was hesitant to get the taffy ones because of the stripes, but it turned out that I love the stripes.

"Ok. I was a disappointed when I got these. They look much bigger in the picture. They really aren't as big as they look, and not worth the money.",3.0

Dont write in any type of swirl. Colors are separated so once the ink runs out of whatever color you are using then its on to the next color. Keeping them but surely won't be adding them into my arsenal of coloring pens & markers,3.0
"These pens are super pretty but don't write too well. I cant really smell them, and I was disappointed when I got them that they essentially have the same combo of ink in every pen. Every pen will go through the same changes, they just each start with a different color. I was hoping for more swirling color changes also, but the color change is quick and does not stand out. I think I would prefer a pen with a vertical contrast rather than layers. Pens also stop writing all the time and I have to shake them and scribble to restart. The ink is also very light- on white paper sometimes unreadable. I have, however, enjoyed making designs with these pens on black paper, they definitely show up well.",3.0
My only issue is these pens Don't color in a rainbow blend of colors. I tried to get the pens to blend the colors but only two worked as stated in discription of them.. The pastel color is soft looking.,3.0

"I've had these pens for about a week now, and while I don't regret my purchase at all, there are some problems that I felt needed to be mentioned for people who are thinking of buying them.

First, what I liked about them: They are scented just like they say in the description, and the scent is strong enough that I don't have to bring my nose to the paper in order to smell them, which is the case for some other brands of scented pens I've bought in the past. I can smell the ink coming up from the paper as I write. I use these pens in journals for short story writing, and upon returning to a section I wrote with these pens maybe two days after I'd written on the page, I was still able to smell the ink, though by then the smell was not as prominent as it had been when I first wrote it out. I still find that to be impressive. Of the pens, I liked the strawberry and orange scented pens the best, and the lemon scented pen was the most prominent of the bunch in terms of intensity of smell and accuracy to its inspired fruit. The colors of these pens are nice and vibrant and for the most part, the transition from one color to the next is really enjoyable and pretty to watch as it creates a really cool rainbow/multicolored effect. Purple to blue, blue to green, and pink to yellow have the nicest effects. All of the pens worked right out of the package and I've never had one completely stop on me so far while I was writing. There was some skipping though, but it's not a frequent issue.

What I didn't like: I had issues with some of the scents of the pens. Lemon is so strong that I can't use it for more than a few minutes before I get a headache. Grape doesn't smell like grape at all, it has some fruit-like scent, but nothing that can be identified. I wouldn't say it smelled bad, it just doesn't smell the way it should. Cherry smells disgusting, which is a shame because it's usually my favorite scent/flavor. The smell of cherry is present, but there's something else in the scent that makes it kind of nauseating. It just didn't hit its mark in recreating the scent. With how the colors are ordered in the pens, orange transitions into purple and this makes for a very muddy color when they change over and it's not exactly pleasant to look at. I think this is something to keep in mind if you plan on using these pens to write letters or cards for other people. I already mentioned the skipping earlier, but I'll put it here again. Lastly, one of the pens I got had a piece pop off as soon as I removed the cap. There's a rubber piece in the cap that the tip of the pen presses into when you put the cap on, I'm assuming this is to prevent the pens from drying out. This piece popped off and I was unable to reattach it, so far this hasn't affected the pen.

These next few things I want to mention are things that are worth noting but I didn't factor them into my score as they apply to these kinds of pens in general and not this brand/set specifically. Pastel pens tend to write with a goopy consistency and have a chalky finish. For modern pastel pens, the colors are usually closer to neon than they are to pastel, as is the case with these pens. Writing done in the yellow and orange are difficult to read, especially on white paper. The ink goes by pretty fast, I can get almost all the way through a section of color in the pens in only a couple pages of writing.

I'd still recommend the pens, honestly. They don't cost much at all and I've enjoyed my experience with them, even when factoring in my problems. I can't say how well they'd work for drawing or coloring, but if you're looking for something fun for you or your kid to write with (especially your kid, swirled gel pens will always be a source of joy) and the cons I listed don't put you off, then I say go for it.",3.0
I got these for my daughter to hand out to friends in goodie bags because they took me back to my elementary school days. They were perfect. The scent the vibrant neon color. It was just like 90s all over again. I just wish they weren't so expensive because then i could really share morw of these experiences with my daughter.,3.0
THese are smaller than a regular pen.,3.0
Gel does not write fluid & they don't really smell. Going to keep looking for good gel pens.,3.0

"When it's summer, my kids are always playing outdoor activities. So when we have the occasional rainy days, I have to come up with some fun activities that we can do inside. That is why I bought these pens, because they looked liked fun. There is a variety of 6 bright pens that color really well. They have not used them enough to see the colors change as they are using them, but I think that is a great idea. They used these pens for coloring, scrapbooking and just drawing fun pictures. The pens are supposed to smell fruity, like orange, lemon, grape, strawberry, apple, and cherry, but I was very disappointed because they didn't have any smell at all.",3.0
Colors are great but you can barely smell the markers.  Scents are very faint.,3.0

"The pens do not smell, nor the ink on the paper. I like the case they come it.",3.0
"The pens seem to be good quality, cute + write nicely. I don't smell anything though + the scent is the main reason I chose them over other (more affordable) options. I have a very sensitive nose too so maybe I got a bad batch based on other reviews on here? Bummer.",3.0
"These pens are alright. I can't actually smell if they're scented or not. The rainbow pens do actually have different coloured ink but it takes quite a while for it to even start blending so if you want your words to be in rainbows then it's probably going to take a lot of writing to make that happen before the colour actually changes. Also, they have moments when they don't want to write so it takes some convincing/rewriting to make it happen. Overall, they're okay and I use them mostly for crafting.",3.0
"The gel pen itself works great.  I thought the gel would swirl in multi colors, but thats not what it does.  Each pen is loaded with about 7 different colors, one on top of the other.  This means you get one color when writing and it will gradually change to the next color as you go.  I am okay with this but my biggest disappointment was the scented portion of the pen set, mine did not have any scent to the pens at all.",3.0
I purchased these because I enjoy using gel pens. I was disappointed that they do not write very smoothly and that the ink takes a while to dry.  There is more smudging that I would like and the pen catches while writing.  I did enjoy the nice vibrant colors and the variety of color choices.,3.0
"I got this item two days earlier than expected, which was nice. They're okay quality,  sturdy pens, with a nice fruity smell. They don't write super great, the yellow cap one specifically is pretty skippy and I had to scribble a little to get it to write. The gel dries pretty quickly, which is nice for a gel pen, though you can pick up undried marks on your hands.
All in all, these pens are cute and fun, but I'll probably keep looking for better ones.",3.0
"I wanted to love these pens so much, but when you write with them, the colors blend together and it all basically looks like the same color in the end. They do skip a little when you write as well, but when they work, they are really smooth writing pens. I guess I was just expecting more of a vibrant and/or noticeable color change. I feel like I bought 6 pens of the same color. I don't feel compelled to order these again.",3.0
"These pens have a nice bright but matte finish, and are milky enough that I believe most would work well on dark papers. They are easy to use, and have good coverage, but they quickly are used up. Also unlike many swirl pens there is not much mixing of colors and thus no watercolor effect. Scent was not very noticeable, but pleasant.",3.0

They write really nicely except for the lime one. Sadly the scent is really light.,3.0
"Really cute pens! They smell very nice and the ink shows up on even dark surfaces! The ink runs out very fast and the light colors can be hard to read, but I guess that's to be expected with gel pens. Each pen has multiple colored/scented ink in it, so while your writing for awhile you'll wind up with a neat looking gradient as one color of ink runs out. Their nice and I like using them but I wouldn't order this particular brand again.",3.0

Furthermore, I often have the feeling that I am dragging my pen across the paper, rather than gliding as I would have hoped.
The book is durable, and the binding is tight, hence the three stars.

"Most of the images are beautiful, but I am very disappointed to see that the image for May (from stock image supplier Zoonar GmbH) has a photoshopped sun above the horizon.

The out-of-focus palm tree on the left looks photoshopped into the image also: it is lit from the viewer's perspective.  I also question the pink sky on the June image considering the foreground shadows indicate a full sun at midday.

Photoshopping calendar images seems to be on the increase.  My 2014 Tropical Beaches Calendar from TF Publishing has two blatantly photoshopped sun pages (Feb. and Dec.); a Tuscany calendar from previous year has a quarter moon on the horizon with the sun shining from the viewer's perspective and the entire image darkened to look like night.

I keep writing things in that box by mistake, then have to cross it all out and rewrite it again under Sunday.

It was already a bit difficult (going from Oct to Nov 2014) to get the previous month's page tucked into the plastic strip at the top when you move from one month to the next. It's extremely tight (which is a good thing in one respect) but I foresee a real struggle as the months go on and more and more sheets have to be forced into that space.  I used to buy the Weekly Planner magnetic calendars from Workman Publishing but they stopped making those after 2013; I used to simply tape the passing months' sheets to the top part. Can't do that with this calendar, though, because that very top is where the magnet strip is located and you don't want to cover that up. So we'll see how it goes. :-)",3.0

"I bought this book as a supplement to a couple of other books that I was using in a study on John.  This is the second of this series that I purchased for such a purpose, the other being Daniel.

The format for both was the same.  The text is broken down into one or two verses and a commentary is given for that bit of scripture.  The comments themselves wary in length and depth in accordance with the particular passage.

There were also comments from other historical and modern Bible scholars that were included.  This made the information more interesting as their insights were a step above most of those given in this book.

I read this one along side a more scholarly book on John and as I noted earlier, the language of this book is very biased towards the author's point of view and could hardly be called scholarly.  There were many passages where I thought the author missed the deeper meaning of the passage, or glossed over important points.

That said, there was some good information in the book and if I wholeheartedly agreed with the author, I would have given probably added a couple of stars.  As it is, I give this three stars for the information it did include and for what I felt it lacked.",3.0

"The concept behind this calendar is spot on, the use of the silhouettes is great but completely let down by the calendar layout and paper stock.

This is a collectors item, for fans, yet it misses the mark completely. I would have liked to have framed some or all the images, but with the dates (which are hard to read) overlapping the imagery and textured paper stock mean there is no point. As other reviewers have mentioned the dates should have been on a separate page, at the very least on the back on the next months image or if you really wanted to make this useable and collectable, the calendar would have been a completely separate page, perhaps as a translucent sheet so you could carefully write on it but not damage the images.

The paper stock has not added value, would have been okay on the cover and envelope, but it, along with the shortcuts taken in layout design, actually makes the calendar look cheap. The images aren't that easy to look at, it would have been much nicer on a gloss or satin finish.

My copies were supplied in a very large box with only paper packaging, leaving lots of movement, resulting in a lot of damage to the envelopes and a small amount to the calendar itself. As these were both gifts this was very disappointing.

We will enjoy the calendar for the year but it is useless as a functioning calendar and not a lot of use as a keepsake, which is such a shame as it could have been fantastic.",3.0
"It was exciting to see a Doctor Who item celebrating its 50th anniversary!  I was worried that it would be one image of a Doctor's face per month and then something else for December.  This is not exactly the case.

The calendar has an outline of each Doctor's face with images from that Doctor's history.  However, some of the designers made odd choices as to what to represent as part of the Doctor's tenure, as well as duplicates of images.  Other images, people, monsters, etc were noticeable in their absence.

Also, this is not a calendar where you can write down when you're going to the dentist.  The dates and days of the week are displayed down the left side of the calendar - almost as an afterthought.

The calendar is made of nice material.  It's heavier and glossier than the usual calendar.  It's kept in a nice envelope as well.  But shipment means that the corners of the envelope and the calendar itself are noticeably battered.

Though my first grader son isn't homeschooled, he's quite ahead of his grade. We do a lot of educating at home to supplement the classroom so he stays challenged. I was particularly interested in these books because I grew up in Kentucky and missed a lot of the California state history. I thought these would be great for us to learn together.

I think they WILL be great... eventually. The description seems to imply that these are good for a variety of ages, but they are just not geared toward a kid of his age. I would say an advanced third grader. It's actually less about the difficult of the prose, and more about the violence and dry nature of the material. It was a bit much for my kid. He alternated between bored and horrified when we read it together. I finished them on my own and found them very informative for my own knowledge.

I also think these are quite worth the price. I expected them to be bigger or hardcover for that cost. However, they are slim paperback booklets. Overall, interesting and accurate, but not quite what they could be.",3.0
"these booklets contain lovely, colorful illustrations. Each of the six runs 32 pages long and includes a table of contents, index, read and respond section on the interior back cover and helpful glossary. The topics are California's Spanish Missions, Trails to California, Exploration of California, California's Indian Nations, Mexican Rule of California And Junipero Serra, a Spanish Missionary. The writing is appropriate for elementary school children. Unfortunately, just like the news this is not an objective telling of history. The main message is the Indians were treated unfairly, badly and wrongly. Maybe true but that is one part of history. the books are repetitive and frankly are not worth the asking price. Nice little paperbacks with politically correct content and lovely illustration.",3.0
I though it would be larger.,3.0
My wife loves this planner! The only negative and I don't know if it says this in the description or if it's just implied but it doesn't start until Jan 1 2016. Why would you sell something in August that you can't use for 4-5 months. At least put the last couple months of 2015 in the thing.,3.0
Adequate....,3.0
"If I had known that nearly every page was littered with biblical phrases I would have purchased something else. The description and pictures included imply that only the back cover had a christian phrase. Still, it's inexpensive compared to similar planners. It has a ""Month at a Glance"" page followed by 2 pages with 7 columns for the days of the week. Each month has 4 weekly pages, so sometimes the end of the month is cut off and included in the following month. It isn't as well organized as other planners I had seen, but it's decent for the price.",3.0

wasn't as big I would have liked it to be.  the photo didn't let me see the actual size.  the book is nice but would have liked it to be bigger.  i'm not too good at measurements that's why I like to purchase items in person but needed something with 2016 already.  this was my first time purchasing on line but might be my last.,3.0

"The pictures are nice and very professional look.
Problem the only picture was a the cover, so did not realize the calendar was more like a poster.
The days are numeric and do not have Square areas to write any notes.  Unfortunately we use are calendars and write schedule notes, which there is no area to do this.
It makes for a good item for a kids room if you just wan to know the day.
For someone that uses their calendar to record schedules then this is not the calendar for you.
I am giving this a 3 star only because it was misleading showing no other photos of the interior, if it was intentional then it would be a 1 star, but hopefully it was not intentional, so 3 star for quality of the pictures.",3.0

"Not too impressed with this calendar. First of all the pad arrived broken apart in 3 uneven sections, the glue didn't hold up. The full month on each page is too small. Not all pages have a picture. I wouldn't buy again. This calendar is ""meh..."".",3.0
"I already had the file folder. The design is so elegant and looks like embossed leather. High quality product and worth every penny. I will love using this every time I look up a phone number.

update: If you want to put even a few  papers in it - like a sticky note or dr appt card, the book won't close.
Also, the alphabet tabs are not practical, making it a little chore to find the right page. Although I loved the look I never used this and went to my shabby old one.",3.0
"Those magnetic clasps really do fall apart easily. It's as though they were attached with Elmer's glue in a hurry. The problem can be solved by using a stronger glue but it shouldn't be up to the customer to make these repairs/adjustments. Other than this, it is a good journal and the paper quality is slightly above average.",3.0
"The only reason I gave this item 3 stars is because one of the clasps does not stay secure. When you try to secure it, it just pops open. Not a big thing, but slightly annoying. Otherwise I am pleased with the purchase.",3.0
"This journal is just OK.  The clasps are a bit floppy and cheap and there is a large sticker on the back which, I think, takes away from the overall effect.  Nice for the price, I guess.",3.0
the tabs bend too easily,3.0
"I got the correct size, I got lined pages, the metal clips did not fall off straight out of the box like so many said they did and over all I love the look of this journal.  It would get five stars if not for one thing: the cover.  The cover looks exactly like in the picture, but that's kind of the problem.  The parts of the cover that are raised and the ridges and stuff I feel would look ten times better if not for the printed on highlights.  The thin strips of white highlighting the top of nearly every raised part of the cover makes the design look very printed on and fake, and while Im happy I got the correct size, Im disappointed with the overall look of the journal.  Will still be using it because I can't be bothered to return it, but Im hoping it's something I can come to love with use.  Perhaps Ill get some paint and go to town on it.",3.0
This day planner is too heavy to carry in your purse. I'm disappointed because it's very nice. I may have to return it.,3.0
"I got this journal along with other designs to use as family tree books for presents.  This is the one I was most excited about but the least impressed with.

The cover is designed in a way where it looks like there is some dimension or embossing however it is completely flat as a printed image.  In person it also looks a lot less like leather than it does online.  The gold accents do have some shine.  There are also two bars on the right edge which clasp from the bottom cover to the top cover in order to keep the book close.  With the added papers and thickness that I put in the book, I was still able to get these clasps to close.

With proper expectations I believe I would have felt differently about the book, but it was not exactly as I expected which was mainly due to the nature of purchasing the product online and not seeing it in person.",3.0
"This looks OK. Like everyone else has said, it is not leather which does give it a cheaper look. I feel like the price is a little to high and should be around mid 20's. I will keep it but would I buy it again or would I recommend it to a friend, no not at this price point.",3.0

"The planner - size, magnetic closure, features - is nice to look at, great to use. It fits easily in purse or backpack and doesn't fall open and crumple or tear pages, appt cards, notes, don't fall out and get lost.

I love elephants and I think it's cute.  If I had a child, I would use all animal ice-packs in his lunch.  I think they would make a child's lunch more fun, but it would take at least four of them to keep a small lunch cool, and if it was lost, that would be one expensive lunch!",3.0

Maybe they are sturdier, but I treat them with care so I can't say how they would hold up to rough handling.  I am a little disappointed in them.",3.0

"I've been journaling in a variety of Paper Blanks journals for years now. I have a preferrence for the magnetic flaps.
The metal magnetic clips which this Nocturnelle book is equipped with are in the way of sliding the journal in and out of its bookshelf position between other books. Either the clips scratch the other book's cover, or they break off. Therefore, handling this journal requires caution. I wish they redesigned it with the flap. One star off.
I had expected a black colored cover, from seeing the picture online. It turns out to have a dark blue-green tint. Although I appreciate it, my preferrence goes for a deep thick leather-feel black, with the gold not so in-your-face shiny, but more worn out with patine. Another star off.
Although I don't find this design flawless like others from Paper Blanks, I still enjoy this journal, and what is a downside for me might not be for someone else, so I still recommend it, knowingly.",3.0

"2012 Calendar: Dilbert (Kindle) / B005VSRKR2

I love the Dilbert calendars, so this seemed like a great deal for a dollar. And... it kind of is. You get a year's worth of comics (although Sat/Sun are combined into one comic, but it kind of makes sense for a ""desk calendar"" situation), and they're the usual pretty funny Dilbert package.

My only complaint is that the comics are kind of tiny and low-quality and they don't zoom cleanly on my device. This is strange because the surrounding margins are large enough that the comics could have been made a little larger. And I get the comics sent to my home email every day and they're always bigger, clearer, and cleaner than these. So I kind of feel like maybe they skimped a bit on this Kindle version.

Here's hoping 2013 will be better with our enlightened future technology.

"I am a huge Dilbert fan, but I'm not sure I'll be using the Kindle Version of this daily calendar at all.  First, if you want to enjoy the calendar, you will have to view it in landscape mode.  The cartoon is small, and the captions difficult to read in portrait view.  Secondly, every other page is blank, which is just annoying.  Could be better formatted for the Kindle.",3.0

"I've been getting the Dilbert desk calendars for several years now and still love to get my daily does of office humor (sometimes it's the best part of my day!).  However, in an apparent cost-cutting maneuver, the publisher this year appears to have taken out the longer Sunday cartoons in favor of having just one regular cartoon for both Saturday and Sunday.  I understand that these calendars are usually in offices where people don't look at them on weekends, but couldn't they at least put one of the longer Sunday cartoons on the weekends?",3.0

"What is wonderful about this collection is the choice of strips and that they are color versions.
What is poor is the layout.
Given the dimensions of the calendar page and te fact that all of the strips are the same four even panels a 2x2 layout would have been logical and made for easier reading. Instead the layout is lazy with all four, tiny panels stretched across the top third of each page, te middle third blank and the bottom third displaying the same picture of Linus and Snoopy every day.
Poor.
Difficult to read but, if you have your reading glasses on, the strips are classic and worth a look every day.",3.0

It didn't go over all that well and I have a hunch she won't hang it.  I am a little disappointed by this calendar myself

Another big disappointment in 2018 is Marys Motto calendar. No can find this year!  I am a huge fan of three other Mary E calendar types if not this Mary EngelDark edition. Heck I buy every other calendar Marys publisher prints! In multiples.  I buy the extras as annual gifts for specific people. I even go online to Amazon. UK to order these calendars for relatives and friends in Scotland. I buy her annual desk calendar, her annual 12by12 wall calendar and the formerly annual Marys Mottos Calendar. The last boasts frame-able art quotes.  I occasionally frame and gift past calendar pages out of the Mary Mottos calendar plus I keep a frame in my craft room whereby I can swap out these clever or beautiful art quotes at will. I tried to buy ALL these favorites just before Christmas 2017. Sadly the  Marys Mottos 2018 calendar was not available.

I enjoy the sweet and sassy calendar in my bedroom while the desk calendar is kept current and read daily in my guest bathroom used by the family and visitors. The Marys Motto calendar inspired everyone hanging near the entry to our dining room and kitchen- until January 2018! Bottom line- I am somewhat disappointed in Ms Marys EngelDark calendar (not to mention my daughters reaction to same) but I am gutted that Marys Motto Callendar is not gracing our dining area wall in 2018.",3.0

"I spent a long time tying to decide on a planner. I chose this one because of the ample space for both daily and weekly planning. However, what I hate about it and didn't discover until I recieved it is that all the monthly pages are grouped together at the front of the book, followed by all the weekly pages, and then daily pages, and at the end empty notes pages. So my current month, week, and day are all scattered across different places in the planner. They do give you two ribbon bookmarks to help with this, but it;s still annoying. Also, the pages are thin and my markers bleed through,",3.0
Photos are pretty dark.,3.0
Great pictures,3.0
The layout is not really my preferred style but it isn't a terrible planner,3.0
I like the theory of this but I'm likely not going to use it. I love that its not dated. My maine issue is that the binding is quite stiff and it does not stay open for viewing the day. Also - the weeks and days are separated so there is a lot of flipping back and forth. If I didn't start to journal my days in it then I'd likely return it.,3.0
Too much for me to create my own dates. I need something that readily available as soon as I scan the pages so not to lose your line of thought.,3.0
"This is a good quality planner and I really like it but there is one thing I HATE about it. All of the month pages are together. Then all of the week pages. Then all of the day pages. This makes it really difficult to look at my weekly view and then my daily page. I really wish there was at least a weekly view then seven daily pages, then weekly view and seven daily pages, etc. It bothers me so much that I probably won't get another one when this one is done.",3.0

"The book only provides 6 monthly calendars! For as big as it is I thought it would have at least provided all 12 months. It provides monthly calendar, weekly goals and another section for daily priorities/goals which I thought was a little overkill. It is nice and will be used for the next 6 months but I wouldn't buy again as I think it is too much wasted space and unnecessary repetition.",3.0
"The function and size of this planner is terrific. However, I am a tactile person and did not like the feel of the paper. Furthermore, the ghosting is so bad. Its very distracting seeing the ink from the previous page. So great aside from that.",3.0
Pages thin. Hard to lay flat.,3.0
"There is a section for monthly pages, another section of weekly pages, and another section of daily pages. It would be so much better if this journal was in chronological order (a monthly page, followed by a week over view, and seven day pages before another weekly over view page etc). Too bad,",3.0
"Just received my planner so I have not really used it enough to fully critique it, but it seems well organized with plenty of space for notes,  reminders,  etc. My only complaint is that it was a little beat up. Not sure if it was sent out that way or if it happened in shipping, but I don't have days required to send it back and wait for a replacement so I'll just live with it.",3.0
"The pictures are wonderful, the quality is great.  However, the blocks are 1 1/2 X 1 1/2 .  This is a problem because I was looking for a calendar with large blocks to write in. These are slightly smaller than advertised.  Plus the way the holidays are printed take up almost the entire block on some of the dates.  There is a lot of wasted space on the month pages, so it appears it could have been printed in a different set up and had larger blocks.  In addition, the month pages have a nice light gray starry background which fits the theme, but makes it more difficult to see and read anything written in pencil.",3.0
"Nice but just not best for me...based on the layout, in actual practice there is just not enough room for my to-do list and I can't get comfortable with the use of the weekly sheets (which I was excited to try) especially since they're not next to the daily sheets for that week. I like the daily priorities but the schedule/tasks part is way too small (both in width and length) for me to accurately represent my tasks. Unfortunately I need to go back to using a planner for daily events and habit tracking and a separate notebook for all of my tasks. I was really excited about this planner but it's just not right for me. :( However this planner is extremely high quality and affordable. If the format is right for you, this is a good planner. It's affordable, so I say try it out.",3.0
This planner doesn't have a month view and I personally can't organize well without being able to see the entire month. I have 3 kids and lots of stuff going on so I assumed it would but it doesn't. The stickers are fun though so that makes up for it I guess.,3.0

"These do not have much more resilience than card stock.  They are flimsy and not likely to last as anything other than a decoration out of reach of most small hands.  They are bright and sparkly.

"Because of the white background color of the Amazon page, I thought the medium and larger stars were just the outer ring. It makes sense that they have a white center, so you can use them to put names on. There is no sticky backing, you will need to tape them up. The name of the stars is misleading. There is no sparkle on these stars, No glitter, no reflection except on the gold portion of the stars. The stars I received had different colors on the stars than pictured here. The mid sized stars were ""rainbow"" the larger ones were a darker blue. The back is completely white, so you could have a project where the students fill in the back of the star themselves.

Really, there is nothing particularly great about these stars. The cut edges are good, the gold is shiney...You could use them for nametags etc - but for ""sparkle"" look elsewhere.",3.0

"Although, admittedly, I didn't notice when I ordered the calendar that it claimed to be an 18-month calendar, it does claim to be one. That claim is misleading and contributed to a lower rating in my review.  If, in fact, the 18-month feature is important to you, pass.  When buying a 2018 18-month wall calendar, one might reasonably expect that there will be a page for each month, from January 2018 - June 2019.  Not so here.  In fact, July - December 2017 are presented on one page - the back of the front cover.  After that, there's the normal 12 month calendar. If I had actually wanted an 18-month calendar, I would be more upset, and more stingy with the number of stars.  Number of months aside, the images are okay.  I would call them more juxtapositions than illusions.  I don't feel the other images are on par with the one on the cover, which itself, falls well short on the awesome meter.  Other than that, the size is good for a wall calendar and the arrangement of the days and dates seem correct.  Rating the wall calendars I have bought over the years, I would say this one rates about in the middle, or slightly lower.",3.0
The longer you look at it the more you find. I wish the pictures where a little bigger but other then that it's pretty sweat!,3.0
"Fun calendar but a couple of the ""facts"" were either wrong or not proven.

Examples:
January 1
""On the $1 bill there is an owl in the upper left-hand corner of the 1 and a spider hidden at the upper right."" This isn't proven to be the case. Lots of people are claiming to see a spider on the upper right, but it's not a proven fact, it could be part of the design. Also, I didn't see anything about an owlonly people claiming that the thing that might be the spider is the owl.

In fact the book doesn't get challenging for him until the second half when it starts to teach times tables.  My son is not a math whizz or anything.  i just think the book is probably geared toward public schoolers who need a lot of review after taking the summer off.

"I purchased this for daily journal use; I already owned a similar one, but found that gel-type pens bled through the pages of that one, as did Sharpies. Many reviews for this item said that wasn't a problem, so I ordered it; unfortunately bleed-through is definitely a problem. You can't use Sharpies in it at all. Gel-type pens (roller balls, etc.) are visible from the other side of the paper, and depending on the color and the pen bleed through also. See photo below; the purple mark is Sharpie, and the orange and black ones are Pilot G-2 gel pens).

The other main disappointment was that the elastic band that wraps around to hold the cover closed had left a decent-sized dent in the cover itself when I received it (second photo).

The interior back pocket is pretty narrow and difficult to access, so don't expect to use it often or for more than a slip or two of paper; trying to crack it open seems like it will damage the binding/ spine of the book more than it's worth.

Other than the above, it's nicely well-made and as advertised, so it's a solid journal, just not perfect nor exactly as the reviews I read made it seem.",3.0

Also you have too work a little bit to get them open--not a lot but as I said, I'd just as soon stick a regular bookmark in and be done with it.

A little trickier than I thought. But my thumb doesn't get as tired holding the book when I commute home.,3.0
I thought i would love these since i get cramps in the fingers from trying to hold open books with one hand. But i find i am not using them much. They do work but i usually don't have them close by and they really are not great book marks so you have to go get them.,3.0

I was hoping to get a few more laughs out of it but I guess these sayings didn't quite make the cut so they ended up on a wall calendar.,3.0

"The calendar is in our kitchen, and like others, I do like the large spaces where I can write b-days and appointments. I gave it 3 stars because the quotes are pretty lack-luster compared to the multitudes of existing someEcards quotes. It's ok, but I'll know better in 2015.",3.0
"The calendar itself is funny, no doubt. But the paper stock used for this leaves something to be desired. When I hung it on the wall, the top corners curled slightly inward and I could not get it to lie flat. It looks a bit cheap which is too bad because the quotes and images are hilarious. Don't think I would order this again.",3.0

This is the first year that this has happened to me, but I'll buy it again next year.",3.0
I love desk calendars and wanted something humorous to look at every day at work. These are funny daily calenders but after a while it gets old and it seems like it's the same thing everyday. I'm not sure what I was expecting because I love the sarcastic and dry humor of ecards but this one is just dull.,3.0
I love someecards but this desk calendar is crappy quality. It was falling apart as I took it out of the box.,3.0
I think these are pretty good - some of the reviewers didn't give enough credit. However I rated it three stars because it's really not safe for work if you're in a conservative office environment! A lot of sexual innuendos (or just blatant sexual content...really) and what not.,3.0
Some days just weren't as funny as I'd hoped,3.0

"I love the color scheme of the map. I wanted something a little different and I enjoy the pale background with the slightly pastel colors of the countries. The map is detailed and the print looks pretty good. My only problem with this map is the quality of the lamination. Upon opening it I noticed the back is pealing off in all four corners. I haven't even used the map yet and so I don't have high hopes that the lamination will last very long. I don't plan on framing this so that is why I wanted one with lamination. It looks like they didn't have it quite hot enough or perhaps they trimmed it too close to the paper so the laminate couldn't stick to itself on the other side. Either way, I'm a little disappointed in the laminate pealing already.

UPDATE 1/4/2015
After inspecting the map today, I noticed a spelling error for a city in Russia that I have visited. There are a lot of names (some strange names) so I could see how misspellings may happen but you'd think it would have been corrected or edited but I guess Yekaterinburg Russia wasn't corrected (spelled tekatingburg). Makes me wonder if there are more errors just waiting to be found. I'm still leaving the 3 star rating but I'll update again if I find more errors(and then perhaps lower the rating if I find more issues).",3.0
"The poster overall is fine. However, I found the actual color to be less saturated than pictured, and for being a large size, the cities feel crammed together. It  will serve its purpose, bit had I seen it in person before buying, I would have picked something else.",3.0

The chart is okay.  I would like one of an actual eye. Not sure how useful this will be. I will be taking a course in iridology and wanted to get a preview and thought this could come in handy. That remains to be seen. Perhaps I will find it quite useful and if so then I will return to revise my review.,3.0

"As a graphics person who regularly works with Pantones this product was slightly disappointing to me. The pages are thin and flimsy, they seem easy to rip and considering how often pantone fans are handled it might be a concern for some people. But if you really need a set of coated and uncoated pantone or just want a set for personal use this is a good option. The colors look good and there is an index in each fan to help locate colors.",3.0
"CYMK is more appropriate to me. But, it's a good one. I love pantone. That's all. Good one. :) !",3.0
"You can get by. Nice concept, however, the world time clock is off and the device is not very intuitive. They need to do more user testing and update the software.",3.0
"The software uses a clunky interface (press Fn+M with 2 hands to get a menu...why isn't there a menu button?) and was given only the most cursory testing.

In my first week of use I found an instance where the recorded spoken phrase in German didn't match the printed German text exactly but neither was strictly incorrect.  Kind of like if the text showed ""swimming suit"" next to a picture of one but the reader pronounced it as the more common ""swimsuit."" Just not caught by the editors and possibly confusing for the learner.

The worst bug is in the ancillary Organizer feature:

1) Time zones are set to one hour per 30 degrees of longitude, not 15. New York should be 3 hours ahead of California, not 1.5...revealing that this app got no software testing at all!

I'm completely serious...right now it tells me it's 2pm in LA, 2:30pm in Denver, 3pm in Chicago and 3:30pm in New York. So I just set my ""world city"" to Vancouver directly north of me and pretend that the app works.

2) Nice idea and a natural feature for this product to offer a quick memo-taker feature in any of the 14 language orthographies.  But if you go back to edit a non-English memo it will tell you it has to delete the original contents first...why? Not having the ability to edit something already typed maks the feature as  completely useless as the World Clock.

This flawed release is somewhat redeemed by and excellent thin hardware design. The BlackBerry-quality keyboard would make it a great tool except for a washed out display for 2014 (looks like a cheap 1990's color LCD...remember Windows CE anyone?) and some navigation keys that are sticky. Unfortunately it's the frequently used ""next"" and ""clear"" buttons that are hard to press.

The keyboard itself is a joy to use for Russian, Korean, Arabic and the Latin-based languages. Being able to enter these languages quickly was the reason I bought the product.  Just be aware you have to use an onscreen keyboard for Persian despite its Arabic-derived alphabet.

The illustrated visual dictionary is only available in five of the 14 languages, but it is a surprisingly useful technical resource. Hundreds of detailed labeled drawings for botany, engineering, etc.

The selection of languages is definitely targeted at expatriate communities coping with their new environs as opposed to the traveler.  For this refreshed product Franklin did add 3 languages onto their boxier EST-5114 translator but I would have preferred them to have been Indonesian, Hawaiian and Thai...not much leisure travel to Iran, Viet Nam and India.",3.0

"Looked around forever for a hardcover college-ruled composition book, and landed on this one. The quality of the pages is great, heavier than all other composition books I've used....however, I've been using this one for about a month, I haven't even filled it halfway, and the pages are already starting to come loose from the spine. This makes me very nervous and I'm currently trying to decide whether I should try to fill the notebook before it falls apart, or look into DIY composition book first aid.
I just looked closer at it and none of the sewn binding has entirely come off yet, it's just visibly loose near the top. But it's still worrisome given that I haven't even made it to the middle of the book and I've only been using it for a month. I haven't even taken it outside or bent it backwards!

Edit: A month later, the book is still intact, it's not in dangerous condition yet, but I did have to snap a couple strings off and I also had to superglue binding onto the back cover. Not going to buy this again.",3.0

These do the job but feel flimsy.  They can slide off easy but not by themselves. They are not so strong they are impossible to remove.  It would serve me better if they didn't hinge but had the feature to remove the back from the front so I could mark my place as well as page. I like to use these mostly on the sides of the pages because they are just heavy enough to bend the pages.,3.0
I like wolves and since it was on sale I bought it. Would have been nicer if it was a little thicker,3.0

The address book was not a normal size.  Its very small and the inside is almost impossible to write in with normal print size.  You have to write super small to get your information to fit.  This was not at all what I wanted.,3.0
They aren't joking when describing this as the little black book of addresses... its like half the size of a sheet of paper! Would not recommend this to individuals who write large or have difficulty reading smaller print...,3.0
"Was looking for something small and feminine to replace my giant black address book that is falling apart. Very pretty to look at and love the elastic closure.  Due to its small size, you have to write very small to get the information in each allocated space.  This suits me just fine, as I don't use it very often and it fits in my backpack/purse. If you don't see well, can't write small, or use your address book daily...go with one that gives you a much larger writing space.",3.0
"This is a super cute address book. If you have large handwriting or are hard of seeing, I wouldn't recommend it. It was a bit of a pain to enter all the addy information in such tiny print, but I love that I can keep it in my pocket or purse without it taking up a lot of space. The rubber band/strap that keeps it closed is handy, too.",3.0

the item was a lot smaller than I expected although i guess i should have read the dimensions better. its a really pretty color but a little small for what i needed it for.,3.0
"Like some of the other reviews, this little pink book of addresses is definitely small. The spaces alloted for each person's entry is small but with clear handwriting, I haven't found it to be TOO small. Its the perfect size to fit in a purse or briefcase. The only issue that I have had with it so far is that the binding prevents the book from closing quickly and easily (which is probably why it comes with the elastic band to quickly loop it closed). Overall, this is a good (and very cute) product.",3.0
The reason I gave 3 stars is because I was very disappointed with the book. My only complaint is that the lines for writing in are so microscopic that I literally could not fit all my address info and phone numbers nicely without cramping my already very small hand writing. I measured the lines and they come to just under 4 mm. It should be at least 5 mm minimum. It really makes a big difference. Anyway I just wanted to warn anyone with normal sized to large writing that this will probably be too small for you. Too bad because this book is very cute. :(,3.0

"I truly like this book and use it quite regularly; however, I noticed about a month and a half after purchase that the front pages started to come apart, etc.! The best thing I can say about it is that I am happy it had that side attached rubber band to keep it closed so the ps ages didn't fall out whil I was awaiting a more sturdy one!",3.0
"I love the book, but the pages rip easily which was a disappointment",3.0
"Not a lot of pages, but okay for most important numbers since we're in the age of technology I wanted an old school phone book.",3.0
"The only bad thing about this book is that the pages stick together. & some, when pulled apart rip. I've provided photos. -it still serves its purpose as an address/phone book, it's just poopy paper.",3.0
One page per alphabet letter would have been more useful.,3.0
It works but very small.,3.0
Meets minimum requierments,3.0
As expected.,3.0
"""Little"" is right.  Slightly smaller than we anticipated.  It'll do the trick, though.",3.0
This is just fine for my needs.  Very happy with it; very durable as well.,3.0
One address book is about the same as the other but this one is okay and actually I like the small size for home use.,3.0
"Much too big for the ""pocket"" address book I was looking for. Has more categories than I needed for each person, therefore leaving little squinty areas for name phone and address. Although double the size of the one I'm trying to replace...less space for the basic's. Nicely made but not what I needed.",3.0
"Much smaller than I assumed it would be. But when it says ""Little"" Black Book of Addresses, it definitely means it will be little! I got for a gift for my mom, but afraid the lines are too small for her writing/her to see (she's only in her 50's, but still-the writing area is SMALL). I may just keep for myself. Perfect for those with great eye sight and small handwriting! I would have given it 3 stars but the writing  area is very small!",3.0
I thought this black address book would be a little bit bigger.  My husband can't find his original address book to transfer addresses from but his old book had just about had it.  Hope he likes it.  It is for Christmas.,3.0
"It's the perfect size for me, but the address spaces are very small.  I can hardly get the names and addresses/phone number from overlapping.  Maybe if you write real small naturally you will be happy with this book.  I will deal with it, but wouldn't buy it again.
Otherwise, the quality is very nice.",3.0
"I love the spiral bound pages, and the elastic strap that holds the book closed. Number of pages is great. My only complaint is that each line on the page is really small, so you need tiny handwriting to fit.",3.0
Book is Ok but I was hoping it was a bit larger so everything did not have to be squished together.,3.0
"Yes, it's cute. BUT, it says ""little black book of addresses"" and it means it! read the dimensions! It's pretty hard to write in, but I like that it could fit in my purse.",3.0
"Cheap, need to write very small, I just threw mine away after I got it. I don't reccomend it for purchase.",3.0
A little smaller than I had anticipated.  I'll have to see if I can use it.  Prompt delivery.  It is good quality.,3.0
"This is a really great book with lots of space for addresses.  However, the book itself is pretty small.  You have to write very small to get the name and address to fit.  I would recommend it to those who have great eye sight or really good contacts and glasses.",3.0
Its ok as a bookmark.  Its pretty.,3.0
The merchandise was good and as expected. Shipping and handling seemed high,3.0
"they were beautiful, but, I wrote you when I received them because I did not receive 3---2 covers and bookmark and 1 cover",3.0
It's ok but it's made of paper and not laminated.  Can easily rip.,3.0
I ordered this but get different one ((((,3.0
"A pretty bookmark, and will be given to my daughter on her birthday.  I am sure my daughter will love it. she loves to read and needed a nice bookmark, but one that if she ruined or lost the bookmark it wouldn't matter because it didn't cost an arm and a leg, so this will work good for her.

BUT description does say ""a pretty blue bead"" (on the tassel) and mine came with a brown one.  No big deal to most people, but I did look through tons of bookmarks and this one I picked mainly because of the bead on the tassel because it is my daughters favorite color and especially since it would be the part hanging out of the book...  SO I am slightly disappointed about that.  Otherwise it is a beautiful book mark, but if bead color can vary it should say that.

IF it had come with a blue bead I would have given it 5 stars, because it is pretty, but item not 100% as described..",3.0
Love books and love book marks. I thought that several came with this order so I was a little disappointed but I still think the book mark is adorable,3.0
"it's just a peace of paper, I though it made from plastic.

"The messages are wonderful in this devotional. It's a great tool for my husband and I to have a devotion together every morning. The black words, however, are very small and hard to see with the font style and dark background. Nice and sturdy base, premium pages, and ring. I received this item used and it is in excellent condition.",3.0
"This is a very nice book for writing recipes but I found it unnecessarily large for my use. This book is probably very useful if you have recipes that require a lot of detailed instructions or long lists of ingredients. It would be a great gift for someone totally new to cooking or baking, or an ideal Keepsake of favorite family recipes from like, grandma. But if you're looking to have a quick reference for recipes you've made a million times, this is unnecessary.",3.0
"Not what I was looking for, but it's still nice. I switched to an app for my smart phone. Now I have all my recipes with me wherever I go. Grocery store last minute? No problem. Friends want a recipe? Email it right from my phone. I'll never go back!",3.0
"This book is so huge! It gives you 2 full letter sized pages on which to write a recipe. I'm not sure how big the manufacturer thinks standard handwriting is OR how elaborate of meals people are cooking. I only use one page per recipe and just notated it in the Table of Contents page. Otherwise, it's cute and I like the plastic waterproof cover.",3.0
This journal is decent. Not my dream wine journal but covers all wine details needed to remember that special bottle. I do enjoy the little quotes at the bottom of each page.,3.0
"We use this book for homeschool (ages 3, 6 & 8).  Some of it they know.  It's not as in depth as I would like and sometimes the question isn't really answered.  We do two weeks worth of lessons out loud in 30 minutes or less.  The kids like it though, and it gives me ideas for Science topics.",3.0
"I have used the Daily Math, Daily Language Arts, etc. in the past and been very pleased. I gave this a try and have used it as a suppliment to my curriculum, but have not used on a daily basis. I have found it fits us better that way.",3.0
"This map is beautiful and I would give 5 stars except that it arrived with a crease in it as if someone stepped on the shipping tube. The top edge is a bit jagged as if someone crammed the cap on too quickly and with force. Other than these flaws, the map itself is a beauty.",3.0
"It's not as detailed with the highways as I was expecting, but it works for now.",3.0
"The map is ok. It did come in a tube but apparently somewhere along the way of packaging it got lots of wrinkles in it. Don't understand how that happens, although lots of people mentioned it. You would think the company could find some way to fix that problem. It is supposedly laminated but it was so thin that it didn't offer enough protection for me. I took it in and had it laminated at an office shop and it is much better now, although it cost me an extra $16 to have it done. Without the extra lamination I doubt that it would have lasted long, as it was very flimsy. I love that it shows all the national parks, that was my main requirement.",3.0
The paper is a little thin.,3.0
"We had hoped this was a match to a map some friends  have, but this one is inferior quality.  It is very thin, as is the laminate (read: not very durable).  The map itself didn't seem as distinct as others we've seen as well.",3.0
"The map is nice, very nice printing. Everywhere labeled nicely. My only problem is the lamination is very thin. Map came out of package creased and now the whole map has lines going down the whole length :(",3.0
too small as i thought :(,3.0
"This map has great detail and is wonderful for learning about Brazil, but the large and odd size makes it very difficult to put in a frame.  I could only find custom designed frames and those were close to $200+.  It is well laminated and is holding up nicely with some large thumb tacks.",3.0
"I receieved this rolled up in a tube. It is laminated on both sides and is a very nice map. I put it in the hallway of my home here in Arizona. Everytime I walk down the hall I can see creases in it from it being folded into a smaller square sometime in the past. This was probably done before it was laminated. You would think it would be flat after arriving in a tube, but it's not. It has those many creases. Even under a flat pane of glass, the creases show up. Beware!",3.0
"The map itself was as expected, a big laminated poster...but amazon just tossed it in a box and it was crushed when it arrived.  The whole map was covered in creases.  But I purchased this your my young child so they didn't care about the creases as much as I did.",3.0
"The map is beautiful, the print is fine and the lamination is very good.
But, the packing was poor (soft and plain cardboard ) and the map arrived crushed and materially wrinkled so I can't use it...",3.0
"Difficult to read.  Too much graphic on the mountain terrains.  Print not clear/too small?  Nothing like the beautiful  National Geographic
maps I used to have.  Laminated map was folded so many times and apparently for a very long time as creases will not smooth
out.  Why was this not rolled and mailed in a tube?  Ugly use of color
  Quite disappointed.  Will probably donate.  Not suitable for me",3.0
Didn't really like the lamination. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you were thinking about framing for display. The irregular size needs to be custom framed and the cost isn't worth it. Its very nice if you're not planning to frame it,3.0
Its not big enough.,3.0
"For the price, its good. The lamination doesn't really give it as much strength as i expected but it will do for now.",3.0
nice mape,3.0
"Liked the map, but it was too big for the wall I wanted to put it on. So, I returned it.",3.0
"I love the map. Disappointed with the shipping. I ordered this map because it shipped rolled up, not folded. I wanted to avoid the creases.  However, my rolled up map was crushed on one side, causing the creases anyways.",3.0
"This is difficult to rate because the map itself is beautiful! Unfortunately, as other customers have stated, the rolling and packaging of the map are not adequate to protect from creases. I reordered after receiving my first map which had creases extending from the top of the map to the bottom and across entire map. The replacement map is better, but still has 7 large (5-7 in) creases and 7 smaller creases across the entire map. Although the creases are most noticeable on the back of the map, several do show through to the front.  The map was not sent in a tube but was somewhat secure in a long box. I chose to keep the second map and deal with the creases, but am disappointed with the overall purchase. I believe the map should be rolled around a cardboard tube just as wrapping paper and other poster-type items are.",3.0
"Thin and not easy to read if you are more than 6 inches away -- but as a decoration, it's decent",3.0
"Nice map. Reminds me of one used in school, very detailed.  However, it is just a laminated piece of paper so not worth the price.",3.0
It was a gift to someone. I can only say he said he likes it.,3.0
"This map is very nice looking, and is laminated as described....but the lamination doesn't seem thicker than a ziploc sandwich bag!  Because of the size of the map the flimsy lamination makes it hard to handle without creasing it.",3.0
I was disappointed the condition I received this in. It shipped in a tube which was great and SHOULD have prevented wrinkles/creases but when I opened it up there were several creases in the map and the top had several small rips across it. I needed it for that weekend so I could not return it but I would not recommend buying from this company. I was hoping that the other reviews were wrong but they are not...this will come damaged in some form!,3.0
The information on this map is good.  However the colors of the states are dark which does not contrast well with the black letters.  I have to move very close to the map to read the state capitals and other points of interest.  The lamination is good so it should stand the test of time.,3.0
"We ordered the 'Enlarged Tubed' map.

First, this Amazon listing is very confusing because it says that the map is laminated, but depending on what size you pick it really isn't. (Even though the 'Traditional' and the 'Enlarged' are the same size, only one comes laminated.) Very deceiving since the comments here say the same for all maps, and mention that it is laminated.

When we got the map in the shipping tube, as soon as we pulled it out, we noticed the ends had crumpled and that the middle had to crinkle marks that are across the whole map. Not sure if this is from shipping (since the tube was in fine shape), or from when the map was rolled with the shipping paper.

The map itself is a beautiful print with great detail and is the only reason we're keeping it.

Overall slightly disappointed. The laminating thing we could have noticed when ordering, but never really looked since the comments said laminated, but are apparently for both types of map. There probably should be two separate listings for this product. Guess it shows that we should only buy from places where the description is really detailed.",3.0
It's a piece of pape and easy broken. Not very good value. But details marked clearly and the package is good. So it's OK.,3.0
"It wasn't very clear of the size of this map when we placed the order and we should have looked harder to find this out.  When we received it, it was smaller than what we were looking for.",3.0
"Factually wrong - People's Republic of China is not distinguished from the Republic of China. The map picks Beijing as China's capital, implying that the People's Republic is in Control of the mainland - which is true. However, the map also consolidates Taiwan as a part of China - which is false, at least according to 23 million people.",3.0
"the map paper is a bit thin, but I love the warmer toned down colors rather than the bright colors.",3.0
"Beautiful map but came destroyed, should be send in a hard tub.",3.0
"Would have liked this map to include the National Parks on it.  I'm using this map to track the places I've been and I've been to a lot of national parks but they are not shown on the map, such parks as Yellowstone, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Yosemite.  Would have been great to have them shown on this map.",3.0
"I love this map. It is beautiful, the colors are subdued and gives you a warm effect looking at it. It would be suitable for hanging in an executive office. The downside is the very thing laminate that is on the map. I used a thumb tack to hang it on my office wall and when I pulled it tight the paper and laminate ripped right through. So its really not very durable. But it is very pretty and a good price.",3.0

"This is a very nice map, very nice detail, colors look just like they do in the picture.  When I received the package it was even in a large Amazon box and I thought to myself, there is so way this one will have creases like some of the other reviews.  Well I was totally wrong.  The creases in the map look like they are just short of the map being folded and put in a flat box.  I am keeping the map, and trying to put heavy books on top of it to get the creases out, but if you don't have time to wait for that to work, I would definitely go with another map.",3.0
"The map is not as sturdy as I hoped, but it is still a useful, easy-to-read map.
You do have to be careful how you fold the map because it can get creases like paper would.

If I were to buy another map, I'd probably make sure it wasn't so flimsy.
But I am still satisfied with what I received.",3.0
"Great map, but difficult to frame. It's dimensions are irregularly large.",3.0
Beautiful map. But to plan your trip you need one with the highways on it.,3.0
"I like the map, it's large and arrived in good condition. However, the reason I got this map instead of any other map of the USA is so I could see the national parks. Unfortunately they marked them in this very light purple color that barely stands out from the background. If you're standing across the room or even a more than a few feet away it's difficult to tell what this map actually is, and I have pretty good vision. It's a good wall piece, but don't expect to get a ton of information out of it.",3.0
"It's a great map, with all the parks highlighted, and it arrived in great condition.

I was planning on having it framed so the parks could be pinned, and the only drawback I found is that it's enormous. If my memory serves me correctly, (because I got it a few weeks ago) it was about 30 x 42.  Don't believe the dimensions under Product Details. It's not normal poster size, so if you are going to frame it, it has to be a custom frame, which can get expensive. Also, you have to make sure you have a large enough wall for it.

Eventually, I did get it framed, but I had the framer cut the pictures off the bottom of the map to reduce the size somewhat.

Ultimately, had there been another option that was more sensibly sized, I would have gone with that instead, but it's very difficult to find maps with the National Parks highlighted.",3.0
"It was okay, thought for 20 + dollars it would have been a bit better quality in paper and the edges on this one were torn appears not in tube completely when you capped it off.",3.0
"This is an excellent quality, high resolution map.  It is billed as ""suitable for framing"" and I wanted to use it as a wall poster, but unfortunately it is folded up, not rolled, for packaging and that ruins it.  It also shows National Monuments, Preserves, etc.  There are also some pictures and enlarged maps around the edges that seem to be just random, I would have preferred that maps of the parks in US Territories were included instead.  If you want to display this map be sure to order the laminated version.",3.0
This is so misleading.  Nowhere is the size of the calendar stated.  I paid more for this tiny calendar in shipping costs that what I could have paid for the full size calendar at Sams Whse.  Next time I will make sure I e-mail may questions before buying.,3.0

This is just messy.....there is little ill be able to use here..id give it 2 stars but I will use it ..it has quality material for pages and a nice size...its just got too much black in the pictures for me and they are so messy....I don't like it...she does give you all the art lessons you need in order to make a quality painting on a page or something to hang up which is a plus if you don't no the lingo already..she covers that very nicely her style is just not for me...not to say its not good for others.....,3.0
"Okay so this Calendar is neat and it does come with everything you need, HOWEVER it comes with these thick card stock pages that you would think would be pre cut or at least perforated so that cutting it out and setting it up would be easy, but no. I spent 4 hours cutting everything out and trying to make it even. I was not happy at all and it really felt like a waste of time. I have since seen much better quality calendars on amazon and would honestly recommend buying one of those instead of this one.",3.0

"The main thing I have a problem with is the ""adjustable"" bar length clasps do not hold.  I just assembled it and they slide down.  When I tried to perhaps shut the clasps one snapped off.  I will figure out how to fix this problem on my own (that's what teachers do) but I am very disappointed.  It does hold the charts fine and rolls great.  It had an abundance of rings which was great.  It also had plenty of room on the bottom for some plastic bins I had used previously.  Other than the clasps great product.",3.0

"Really this was my mistake....i have since looked at other related items that are laminated for the same price.  I think this was too much for something i still had to pay to have laminated!  In the end this product ended up costing me 30.00 to laminate plus the cost i paid for it and i had to cut each piece out one by one once i had the full sheets laminated....ugh!

I have to say the item was as described so i am giving it 3 stars even though i feel like it was really 2 because of the fact that this really will need to be laminated for it to last any amount of time and the price.",3.0

"Not big enough for most menus and folders. Not enough pockets for all types of restaurants. Folder pockets are not deep enough, long enough, or wide enough.",3.0
I really wanted to love this and it has some nice features like the ordering pad and place for a pen but the folders are just too small and only on one side of the page.  We have to fold nearly every menu and it really doesn't hold very many.  We've only had this for about 6 months and several of the folders are so packed that the holes have ripped and they no longer hook into the binder rings.  The way it zips to close and keeps everything together is really great but it just needs more and larger folders.,3.0

"This is so cute.  and great for quick daily lists.  The columns are narrow of course and I can't fit much on each row.  That's an unavoidable issue of course (unless it was slightly wider overall.)  I use it for jotting notes of daily activities to help me do time sheet on Friday. The big deal breaker is that my optical mouse won't work properly.  Something about the surface doesn't allow for smooth mouse response.  I am using just the cardboard backer as my mouse pad.  The list section is now taking up an extra spot on my desk, defeating the purpose.  Another issue is I get sweaty hands, and the lower edge gets weird if I do rest my hand on it for extended mousing sessions.  I see my husband isn't using his either.",3.0
"let the buyer beware.  This gift, while amusing, is extremely overpriced.

When I ordered the item, there were no dimensions shown in the listing.  Having looked at similar items, I assumed (and you know what happens when you assume) the pad was at least 6""x9"".  Wrong.  It is, in fact, identical in size to those pink phone message pads at approximately 3""x4"".  Moreover, the paper is very flimsy.

Quite candidly, I feel a bit silly having purchased it without knowing the dimensions.  However, it was a hit with the recipient so all is not lost.",3.0

"As a business coach, I needed something to track meetings with clients, so this is pretty useful.

Pros:
- Compact size is easy to carry around
- Page setup and layout is amazing
- Covers all the important areas of a meeting someone would take notes on

Cons:
- It's a notepad, not a notebook, so it lacks a cover
- Only 60 pages (most planners are +80)
- The back of the pages are just blank, which is kind of lame. Could have used the extra space for something.

This is useful if you take brief notes on a regular basis. I'd love to have given this to my clients as a gift, but the lack of a cover and it not being a bounded notebook, plus the fact that the back side of the pages are blank, are big drawbacks.

If they made this a notebook with bound, double sided pages it would a 5-star product because the page layout blows away most meeting notebooks.",3.0
I used these on every single meeting we have. I write down everything that is important and look professional when doodling the other characters attending the meeting...  A Must have if you enjoy meetings and take them seriously as much as I do...,3.0
overpriced,3.0
its ok,3.0
add sticky to the notes and make them 5 star product,3.0
Way expensive!,3.0
"Ok, but WAY too small :(",3.0
"I give this 3 stars because it is very small
Only about 3 inches by 3 inches square - about the size of a pad of sticky notes which it actually is.
I am not sure why but I thought it would be much larger than that.
Keeping it anyway since it is a gag gift and it will actually do its job.",3.0
The board gets 5 stars but the pen never wrote so..... I could only give it 3 stars. We have to use another pen but the eraser is excellent.,3.0
"I have a couple of these. They are fun, but they tend to curl up at the corners. It seems like any post-its NOT by 3M just don't have the same quality of sticky. Someone must be doing a good job of defending their secret recipe...",3.0
Much smaller than I expected for the price.,3.0
Funny and still pretty useful even though the sticky part is a lie...you can stick it on something for about two minutes before it falls off. For what they charge for these things I'd expect it to do better.,3.0
These have been a huge hit with my team in the office. I wish they could have been just a little larger,3.0
Item was as expected. I havne't used it though. Just a random purchase that I do not regret buying.,3.0
Do not stick very well.,3.0
"I did not read the fine print on this product and was disappointed to find that it is a very small post-it size note. I was hoping it would be a larger note pad; for $6, it is overpriced!",3.0
"I wish there were more pages for eacH GAME.
ESPECIALLY ON LONG ROAD TRIPS. KEEPS KIDS OFF OF ELECTRONIC GAMES!",3.0
"On the small side, but my co-worker was stoked that was the objective. It would be nice if they were larger.",3.0
"Be prepared when you receive this item that for the price you will likely be VERY disappointed when it arrives.  When thinking a cube of sticky notes think less than 1/4"" in height, this will last all of about 2 days.",3.0
the lines are too small to even write anything on it.  I got them for my mom as a joke and she thought they were funny but was unable to use them.,3.0
ok,3.0
"I like this a lot, what you see is what you get. 2 things I didn't realize: 1. There's no Saturday or Sunday, which is weird, in my opinion. 2. I thought it'd have a magnet on the back but it doesn't. Still does the trick, though.",3.0
"Didn't really end up using it, a little white board saves some paper and might be an option to consider.",3.0
Smaller than expected but still cute.,3.0
"This is a great item EXCEPT: where is Saturday and Sunday since that is still part of the week. .duh....
It does NOT stick to anything, has no sticky back to it as I hoped it would. ""THIS WEEK"" . If it had both of these I would give it 5* but since it doesn't it gets 3 *.

I would not buy it again since its missing Saturday and Sunday and is not sticky on the back.",3.0
"Cute, but really overpriced.",3.0
I wish it was magnetic,3.0
This would be much better if it had a magnet on the back to stick it to the fridge.,3.0
a gift. I don't know if it hit the spot. I think not.,3.0
No Saturday or Sunday.,3.0
Awkwardly larger than expected. I thought they would be sticky note sized... I was wrong,3.0
I expected these to be sticky notes. There is no sticky backing.,3.0
fine,3.0
I just wish this had the magnet on the back so I can keep on the refrigerator.  I will have to use other magnets to hold it up there.,3.0
"Its a simplified planner. To write in what would be for dinner, and what will be going on each day of the week. It isn't utilized in my house because it doesn't come with a magnet attached so its not on the fridge. Instead it sits beside the fridge on the counter and is often moved and lost and forgotten about. This could be great for younger kids to see so that the whole family is all on the same page with what is going on or for older people or people in general that aren't tech savy. However my fiance and I have a shared calendar through google on our phones that works just as well.",3.0
Not for me.,3.0
No Saturday or Sunday (I though that the weekend would be the 6th slot). It's nice enough but I couldn't find one with all seven days of the week (which I need - I'm list obsessed or I'll forget everything). No magnet backing to put it on the fridge - ugh.,3.0
"Visually they are cool little notes.
Unfortunately the sticky side is lacking, and my notes fall within a couple hours of sticking them.",3.0
Two were bent but item is O.K........,3.0
Really cute but I've had it for a day and two of the pads have already fallen out of the folder.,3.0
While I like the labels on these sticky notes the sticky level leaves something to be desired. Writing on the note and then pulling it off to stick it on my fridge or wall calendar and they keep falling off. Annoying! If you are only planning on using these stuck to other papers or kept flat they will probably suit your needs.,3.0
"I'm very torn about this purchase. The sticky notes themselves are adorable, however they don't stick to things very well. I bought a set of these for a doctor that I work with and the notes don't stick to the walls or cabinets as well as some of the other brands. They stick for about a day and then start falling off.",3.0
"These are funny and have alternate meanings for the title letters.  They make a good gift for a laugh with an office coworker or spouse.  I do think they are WAY over priced but got them anyways for the laugh.  The laugh was also on me because some how I ordered two of them at full price.  Just sticky-notes with a catch-your-eye phrase at the top.  Not bad, not great but no need to get two sets.",3.0
cool,3.0
Not thrilled with these but they're fine.,3.0
"Super cute, great idea, LOVE the concept, but only the real ""post it"" brand has real stickability! These only stick to paper, curl up when stuck to anything else and fall off in a matter of minutes :(",3.0
Much smaller than I expected.,3.0
they  are adequate but they are not as cute as I had originally thought,3.0
Good,3.0
Cute but sticky not very good;  Not like post-it notes.,3.0
These are real small,3.0
Goof office present but a bit small and limited quantities of pages,3.0
its ok,3.0
Smaller than expected and the cover color is not very attractive.  Bought this as a gift and needed to supplement with something more substantial.,3.0
I bought for a bad santa gift with pens that were shaped like matches. It was funny. But just okay. I wouldn't buy it again.,3.0
"We got this book because we say it in a store.  Although its a cool book, its kind of nasty when you think of it.  And its a big over priced for a blank book.  Makes a good gag gift.  Nobody in our guest bathroom ever signs it!",3.0
"sent back liked it, friend and wife bought me one before it arrived. I stay neutral",3.0
Notepad absurdly small.,3.0
I really like this book besides the fact that I open the package up and I am disappointed to see ants all over my book. I do not understand how something like this happens but I am not impressed!,3.0
Cute but kind of useless unless so many people borrow books from you that you can't keep track.,3.0
Fun gift for me and my lady!,3.0
"It is a funny notepad with some humorous notes on it, but very skimpy-- only a few pages, so not worth the money really.",3.0
the pads  are good liked the sayings an one goes into my sons lunch every day he likes the notes,3.0
the item provided the perfect gift for a friend.  the original price seemed reasonable but with delivery cost it proved to be pricey.,3.0
The product itself was want I needed. I used them for birthday invitations. I did have a few problems. It look longer than said to get them. The discription on the box said that it comes with 20 cards and 20 envelopes. I only received 15 cards and 21 envelopes. I couldn't return them because it already took longer to get here so I needed them right away. I recommend the product but give yourself time before really needing them just incase you have to return them.,3.0
Good for the younger set. Won't replace texting.  An adult version would be fun. Good back to school item for lunchbox notes.,3.0
LOVE THE STAMP but I many books i LOVE,3.0

As expected.  Got this for a gift.,3.0
"I did not pay attention to the size of this product and therefore was a bit surprised when it arrived. The sticky notes are the same size as your average sticky notes: 3""x3"". I had expected a slightly larger product so you don't have to pull out the glasses to read the text or fill it out - than again, maybe that's the point... It keeps the message short and sweet :)",3.0
The complaint notes or cool but in the picture they looked so much bigger. The complaint notes weren't event that sticky they hung for about 10 or 20 seconds.,3.0

"Not worth the price, if you can get it when its on sale i would say its alright but shipping and the original price was not worth. Additionally my book was bent :(.",3.0
Just to few pages to make it worth it in my opinion.,3.0

I place this in a xmas stocking and they love it, small enough my son has it in his brief case, you will be able to tell a history, share your wishes with the person, tell them how beautiful life is with them and much more... I love this book, I am always telling my son how proud and funny and sooo many things that with this he just can open a page and is there , even if I am not.",3.0
"This was purchased for a co-worker of mine whom was going to another office. Needless to say, we adore her and think she is awesome. I loved the idea of getting this book for her and having another co-worker of mine help me fill it out. Going through the pages some were GREAT and some were extremely repetitive which is a little bit of a disappointment but I guess there are only so many way to tell someone that they are awesome. All in all it went over pretty well but, I really wish I would've gotten a different fill in the blanks book.",3.0
its a very small book. i expected something bigger. its cute.,3.0
this is a cute idea and fun to fill out but they say the similar things on many of the pages I wish there was more variety.,3.0
Was very cute mom loved it but when it came it was much smaller which made it not really worth the money but still was very sweet and fun,3.0
I used for my four children's answers and compliments. It is a little bit small. We made it work.,3.0
"Honestly, this product is just okay. The price keeps changing dramatically (I bought it at around 14$, and now its at 9$). I would say it may be worth 5-7$. The book is VERY tiny and it has 50 ""fill-in"" pages. There were a few pages where I felt I could really personalize it, but I found myself rewording many of the prompts in order to not provide a generic answer that could be applicable to all moms vs. something unique about my unique relationship with my mom. Overall, this is just okay. I bought one for my dad at the same time too in ""diary"" format with this being ""hardcover"" and they look exactly the same. Just not a fan of this. I'd give it 2.5/5 stars, but since I can't, I'm rounding up to 3.  Next time, I'll just make something by hand.",3.0

Cute but very small in size and I felt like I was answering alot of the same or similar questions.,3.0
"I think this is majorly overpriced for what you get. It's much much smaller than I thought which is totally my fault for not reading the dimensions, but for how tiny it is any price over MAYBE $5 is just not worth it. It's an overpriced novelty that really only seems cute if a little kid gets it for their parent cause otherwise it seems cheap. And even then it's probably more heartfelt, cheaper and cuter for a kid to make their own ""what I love about..."" book. Save the $10, make this yourself.",3.0
"It's cute, not very happy with the size. For the price I thought it would be much bigger than it is.",3.0
Its super small and theres hardly enough room to write. Still a cute product.,3.0

It is SMALL!,3.0
"There's a prompt in here that doesn't really work: ""I wish I would have known you when..."" I think most folks, other than those adopted at a later age, have known their mothers their entire lives.
Also it's a tiny book. Great if kept as a keepsake in a box or drawer. Not really big enough for a shelf.
Otherwise, my sister and I really liked it. We each wrote a response to each prompt independent of one another and are going to have her guess which of us wrote which. She loves games and both responses are in my handwriting so it should be fun!",3.0

I read reviews so I knew it would be small. Would enjoy the book more if it were bigger and had more lines for writing.,3.0
"The book is VERY small. I expected it to be a rather decent size, but it is rather disappointing. It is 4.5 inches in width, and is almost 3.5 inches from top to bottom. it comes in a plastic sleeve, with a few examples, which was cool. The book has 50 pages to fill in, and the last page says ""I love you, mom"". It is really sweet, and thoughtful but I wish it was bigger, especially for the price with shipping.",3.0
VERY SMALL! Do not expect this to be a book size! It is the size of a small notepad!,3.0
"The first few sentences were beautiful, but once you get towards the back they begin to stop making sense... so it really limits the words you can use to personalize it.",3.0

"I love the book, but was disappointed by the size of the book I received. I didn't read into the product enough to figure out it would be as small as it is!",3.0
"First of all, it was much, much smaller than I expected. Unfortunately, it also wasn't packed very well because it got up against the edge of the small cardboard sleeve it was shipped in,  and that got a bit crushed on the end,  and so did the ends of the book. Not horribly, but this is going to be a Christmas present so I wasn't super pleased. Over all a cute idea, although for the price I would have expected something a bit larger. The size and the small amount of damage is why I'm rating 3 stars.",3.0
"I didn't realize it didn't have a magnet attached, and I tried to use a magnetic clip but it's very heavy. That was my bad. But I'm not a fan of the perforation, it ripped a lot and the lists are so big I cut them in half to reduce waste, the whole thing ended up being an expensive colorful notepad.",3.0

However, upon arrival, I noticed it has checkboxes for things like ""Sex"", ""No Sex"", and other inappropriate wording as the suggested cause for the negative feeling. I liked the light humor, but without blacking out each page in certain areas, I can't use them for the foster son I had in mind. Bummer.",3.0

"This is okay but it doesn't have a lot of words.  The larger box has more, so I should have only purchased that. Even so, both lacked plurals.",3.0

"Here is a picture of the back of the box, which tells you what word cards are included.",3.0

A pretty nice set but a little pricey for a small set of posters. However it is colorful and well done so still glad I purchased them.,3.0
"I do not need to own this in order to review it.  I can read the picture of the poster.  And that is what bothers me. Rules 4 and 6 of the Class Rules begin with the word ""Work"".  We need to change how we teach our children about school and classes and what is the difference between that and ""work"".  These are not places of ""work"".  These are places of studying and learning.  More suitable words should be used in place of ""work"" in order for children to have a positive and more relevant outlook on school and then eventually at their jobs or ""work"".  Children do not get paid to go to school.",3.0
"I'm not sure how this item was supposed to be shipped, but it arrived unprotected in a box with other items that I had ordered.  As a result, it got torn in transit.

"The uppercase letters are approx 1/2"" long (13mm).  I feel that it could cause eyestrain from across the room if looked at too long, even in well lit conditions.

While my 6yr old daughter absolutely loves it, i realize now I'm gonna have to laminate it for her to actually use it how she wants, with dry erase markers.  This was a Christmas gift. Her biggest request was a ""school set""!  It's perfect in every way except when it comes to using it.  Magic eraser works to get dry erase markers off it if it's not laminated - FYI but I think that may end up ruining the paper. I also wish it came in an easier to take apart packaging.

"The only border you can store in here is the narrow kind.  If it is over 2.5 inches wide, don't even think about it.  I attached velcro to the plastic too because when you go to fold it up, your border starts to slip out.  I do like that it folds up nicely.",3.0
Doesn't hold as much as I thought!,3.0
Flimsy.  I wish it would hold it's shape better. I'm going to put a piece of thin cardboard in mine so it will hold its shape which will make it easier to put things in it. I also wish it had a smaller pocket for small items.,3.0
These are pretty cheap feeling and get worn quick with frequent handling.,3.0

These are cute but rather small. They would be difficult to read across a classroom.,3.0
Watch out- it's only a record book!  You have to purchase the plan book separately!  The heading is very misleading.,3.0

"I am a fourth grade teacher, and in past years I've always written the daily schedule on the whiteboard and just changed the few things that are different each day, like special areas or early dismissal days.  This scheduling pocket chart seemed like a great way to show our daily schedule because the students can see the time for each activity on the clock, and it also frees up much-needed whiteboard space.

Overall, it is a good product.  The pocket chart itself seems well made, and the card inserts are colorful and glossy.  The pocket storage at the bottom is useful for those cards you aren't using that day.  For these reasons, I like the product.

There were a couple of things I found disappointing though.  The first was my fault for not thoroughly reading the item description, but the second I feel should be corrected by the manufacturers.  So first, there aren't nearly enough cards for the way the students' schedule changes from day to day.  I barely had enough cards for one day of activities, and after I made cards for the different special areas, I had to make color copies of the blank cards and get them laminated in order to fully use the chart.  I do wish that more cards came with this, but the number of cards was clearly stated in the product description so that was my fault.

Another disappointment was that when you receive the product, the cards are all together on one large page, and they are NOT perforated for easy separating.  I cut them with scissors, and of course I'm not happy with how uneven I cut them.  I would have been happier if these cards were either perforated, or they came already separated so that teachers don't have to use rulers and make sure they are cutting evenly.

Also, these are laminated so that you can write on and wipe off if you'd like.  However, I found that if you do that, as soon as you put the card into the pocket, it rubs against the plastic material of the chart and smears.  If you don't want smears, permanent marker seems the only way to go.  Since I used permanent marker, I can only use these cards for one year, as I'm sure my schedule will change next year.  I can always reuse the pocket chart for other things, unless the card inserts are sold separately.",3.0
"Seems durable. Wasn't happy that the cards weren't pre cut like the picture had them. Nor does it come with hooks for you to hang it up. Comes with the blue schedule holder and five time slot sheets. 3 time slot cards per sheet, so a total of 15 cards after you cut them out yourself. Still messing around with it. The space for cards doesn't leave much room for anything other than the cards. Planning on putting a clock right next to this jumbo daily schedule for the kids to start learning how to tell time.",3.0
I just wish it had more pockets so I could make a more detailed and visual schedule for my son. I'm going to end up buying another just for that purpose.,3.0
Charts for the purpose of teaching kids should be made with lamination.  I had to put it away when it arrived and will have it laminated before putting it up on the wall.  Other Carson-Dellosa Publishing charts from the same delivery come with pre-lamination.,3.0
"This is cute, however I expected it to be more of a notebook from what the other customers were saying in their reviews, and it's really just thin pieces of paper. $3.00 is a little overpriced. Something that could be found in a dollar bin somewhere.",3.0
"I like this for what I use it for - daily schedule for my students.  I needed to laminate the inserts, however, in order to be able to wipe off and use again.",3.0
Good but thought it's write and wipe but it's simple rectangle white paper!...expensive,3.0
Cute,3.0
I don't remember getting this.  Was suppose to be a Christmas gift for my grand daughter.  When she opend her other panda gifts. That one wasn 't one that was wrapped,3.0
OK for the price,3.0
"The white cards are to be inserted/placed into half plastic slots. Result is that the card is never completely covered by plastic and if you have kids who are eager to touch or manipulate it provides them with easy access to the card. I wish the the plastic slot covered each card fully so as to keep sticky fingers at bay. it is a light weight pocket chart and the tabs are sturdy. If the pockets were full instead of half, I would have given it more points. thanks.",3.0
"This chart is a little long, but if you aren't worried about space issues, then it will be okay for you. I wish the cardstock was a bit heavier duty, but it works. No frills, very practical.",3.0
"The way the box shows it makes it look as though you are getting 6 - 8 scene sets NOT 6 -scenes per set.  Just a miss read on my part.  The other issue I found was the pattern on top of the scenes, my student matched the pattern (like a puzzle) instead of matching the scenes going in order.",3.0
"I bought this to work on sequencing with some of my speech therapy patients.  I've used them in geriatrics and pediatrics.  I love that it has pictures and not illustrations.  Some of the pictures were hard for my geratric patients to see, but that would happen with anything visual in that population.

One big negative - The cards have a painted border across the top and bottom which is in a wave form.  Some of my kids figured out that they don't have to look at the picture, but can simply figure out which part of the wave should come next.  I have these kids sequence the pictures up/down instead of across, but I can't be sure they aren't looking at the wave.  They need to either take away the border, or make it one steady line.  I'm considering either taping or painting over the border.",3.0
"The cards were nice, but were a little confusing for my younger students. If you are first grade and above these would make a great center or learning station.",3.0
"My daughter already has the 4-scene set to use in her classroom, and the kids enjoy it, so I ordered this 6-scene set for her.  The picture on Amazon shows colorful illustration sets (like the other set that she owns), but the set that we received is a different version.  Apparently what we received is either an older (or newer??) version which is more like actual photos, and they are much plainer/less interesting to look at. She decided it wasn't worth the hassle of returning the item, but beware that the version you receive may not be the one that is pictured on here.",3.0
This isn't entirely what I was expecting. I expected the material to be like a cardboard material.  Instead it is like a sticker material. I tried to stick it on bulletin board paper and take it off again to see if it was restickable but it's not.  If you like to reuse your bulletin board decorations then I would not recommend you get these.,3.0
"Great idea, but these peel the pain off the wall. Can't use them that way. Had to purchase extra boards in order to use them",3.0
"I've no idea why these are so expensive here. Go to any Borders, they are almost always in stock and for $13.99, less than half of what they are here.",3.0
"I own the calender.  I spent $13.99 plus tax to get it at Borders and love it.  I think that it is appauling that people are taking advantage of the ""fan-dom"" and charging such outrageous prices.  It is a shame that people that are not even fans are rushing out to buy Twilight merchandise in bulk and then slapping it on the internet several times its actual worth because they themselves made it so that there are none in the stores.  This should be a crime and I hope that no true Twilighter is guilty of it.  And I hope that the money you gain bites you in the long run...and not like an Edward bite, but a nasty rabid dog type bite!",3.0

"I expected twelve different pictures, was really disappointed.",3.0
"Very happy with this calender, but was surprised it was all the same photos of Jesus.",3.0
"Loved the pics...very talented indeed, Akiane is.  But it is very hard to write on the calendar itself...paper that is used does not accept pens...tried different types of ink too!",3.0
Bought for my mom for her birthday. I prefer last year's calendar. The artwork in this one is repetitive and ruined with words written all over. I don't recommend this.,3.0
"Beautiful artwork - reproduction is rather ""muddy""",3.0
It was my fault that I didn't realize that the calendar was for 2013 instead of 2014.  It is just that the 2014 calendars are out not.,3.0
"We would do most anything for our kids, and this was a desire by one of our children- this was the least expensive way to get a copy of Jesus by Akiane.
So I closed my eyes and pushed- buy it with one click, and never looked back.  Jesus gazes lovingly at us, and you get 8 cards to share, or place somewhere to feel His presence.",3.0
"These are very nice note cards, although a little costly in my opinion.  I purchased them as a request from my mother to pass on to her great grandchildren",3.0
"The pictures are beautiful but I was disappointed that there were not more new ones. I have the 2013 calendar and most of the pictures are repeated.
Ve",3.0
"This calendar is beautiful and $10.00 less than buying it on the artist's website.  The reason I gave 3 stars was because I was expecting different pictures.  I understand it is a ""Prince of Peace"" themed calendar but there are 3 months where they use the same painting/face with just a different background. Also, 2 of the pictures were kind of blurry, and thats not how she paints so that was kind of disappointing.",3.0
"The book is nice, but I thought I  was ordering the wall calendar.  I guess I should have paid more attention.  My daughter and daughter-in-law said they are alright, but would rather have the wall calendar, like I got them every other year.",3.0
"Though this is a great planner, I thought I was purchasing the calendar.  The title of the item specifically said ""Calendar"" in parentheses next to the product name, but the description sounded like it was for a planner.  I decided to give it a try and purchase the ""calendar,"" knowing that I'd be content having the planner.

I just want to warn anyone who thinks they are purchasing the calendar.  This item is not it.",3.0
"This is a nice calendar with lots of space to write but I prefer the columns the other way and I miss my silly illustrations but the pocket is nice as are the stickers.  However, the stickers have way too many for each subject that should only have one or two like the first day of school, field trip, and many other school related ones.  The fact that it can hang with a magnet or a thumb tack is nice as well.",3.0
"Oddly, I was disappointed with the calendar because it's simply too large. It takes up a huge amount of space, either wall or refrigerator. The concept is nice and what I was looking for. The pages are slick, so I understand the issue about writing with pencil, however I do feel that there is plenty of space to enter the individuals' events. There are contact tabs (nice) and a small pocket at the bottom which extends from the end of the months section causing the calendar to hang even lower. The pocket is also rather shallow so papers don't fit too well.

I have since had to purchase another calendar since I'm unable to find the great family organizer calendar I used last year which was pretty much normal sized.",3.0
The larger version with the bible quotes included is MUCH better. I gave these as gifts by now know to choose the larger version. The writing is awesome.,3.0
Weird conversational tone...,3.0
PRINT IS  TO SMALL and NOT BOLD ENOUGH.,3.0
"It's supplemental to my devo by same author w/same name.  I'm dissappointed that there is NO scripture on any of them....Didn't ck carefully as I assumed there would be.  I'll take responsibility for that, but not as happy as I expected to be.",3.0
"I'm really enjoying this inspiring calendar, but there are passages in here that sometimes make me cringe. For example: ""your limited human perspective"", ""awareness of your inadequency"", ""your human love is ever so limited"", ""weak ones like you"", etc. Things like this were not encouraging for me. It made me feel like I'm nothing. Jesus is love and all powerful, and I don't think he would make us feel lowly. I recommend this calendar, but don't be surprised by some of the language.",3.0
Print is too small. Size is smaller than I thought. Would be nice if entire scripture was printed on calendar.,3.0
it was badly damaged when I received. too much trouble to return and no label to return it. not good,3.0
"it has good message. but you cannot tell the date. and it does not have full page of date.
it goes half and you have to flip back to get the other half of year.",3.0
"VERY BEGINNER.
Yes, it says beginning Geography grades K-2 but its more like preschool or kindergarten at best-
I was hoping it'd have some material in there for 1st to 2nd Grade levels but its way too basic.
It should be marked for preschoolers, not up to 2nd grade.",3.0
I like this book but I bought for my Kindergartner who is still learning to read. A lot of the lessons require that the child be able to read. My son still does the lessons but I have to be right there with him basically telling him the answers because the reading is more advanced for that age.,3.0
"We use this in our home school for my first grade daughter. The lessons are age appropriate and simple with fun activities. The only problem I have with this book is on many of the pages it instructs the child to color something in, cut it out and glue it on the next page. However, cutting it out will leave the next page riddled with holes and unusable so I'm not sure how they want the child to do this. Many of the lessons are not able to be completely finished because of this. Annoying and an easy fix for any book publisher. I'm not sure why they didn't catch this problem.",3.0
"5 stars for the book, but 0 stars for this listing. I bought this book for $5 at Five Below so $23.00 is beyond ridiculous. I could understand $10 but not more. I love the book, though. It's nice to write without any pressure and not have to come up with the topics on your own, for once.",3.0
I paid a lot of money for what  I thought was a hard bound book when it arrived it was no more than a tablet  with 300 writing prompts,3.0
"Oreder these for My kids. I wasn't expecting anything fancy, But its just cardboard. Kinda Bad Looking because I thought they were gonna Be Plastic.",3.0
Smaller stickers than I thought. But cute!,3.0
"Very cute design and vibrant colors.  My only dislike is that the paper is very thin.  I was hoping for a thicker feel, such as cardstock that wouldn't crease so easily.",3.0
kinda small,3.0
"I bought this for work and overall it works as intended but isn't really 100% what I wanted.

I have to say that I work in transportation so the use of this for me is not ""as intended"", but it does work.

If you are in a classroom setting or even using it at home for organizing your kids then I highly recommend this item.

The colors are bold and bright.

The pockets in the pockets are really great and they fit a 4x7 not card perfectly.

I keep individual pieces of paper in most of the pockets and for that it is not ideal...BUT I have a 1"" 3-ring binder in one of the pockets and in two of the others a stack of 50 or so pieces of paper and those are perfect!",3.0
Nice bright colors  but the white cutout is not truly white.,3.0
"I got these for a principle appreciation day. They were good quality. The description was terrible tough. I thought I was getting 42 pages  with 4 handprints on them equalling 168 hands. Nt the case thought, there are just 42 handprints.",3.0
"These are perfectly nice cutout handprints, but the measurement is wrong, wrong, wrong.  Amazon AND the manufacturer's website both describe this as being an 8"" by 6"" handprint.  About the size of an average man's handprint I'd guess.  Instead, these are really about 5"" x 4"".  I am a petite adult woman and these are approximately the same size as my (small) hands.  They're fine, but I was hoping for more room to write on.",3.0
Little too small,3.0
OK This is nice but the dimensions given in the product details is way off so larger than I expected but going to make it work.,3.0

If the Earth is bigger than the Moon, then why is it only 7,900 miles or why is the Moon 72,160 miles in diameter?  I got these cards to help my kids prep for end-of-year standardized tests and it's not comforting thinking I'd have to double check every single fact in this box of 324 cards!",3.0
I want to love this but I just don't. Extra cards fall from the intended storage pockets.,3.0
"I am starting the calendar the month of Aug. (When my son starts school again).  This year the 1st of Aug. starts on saturday.  There are 31 days in the month.  Not enough pockets to put all 31 days on it, unless you take away the days of the week, which for me, defeats the purpose.  I know this won't happen every month, but kind of a disappointment for it to happen on the very first month that I am going to use it.",3.0
"Some of the items were missing, and the bag was never opened.",3.0
If they had included the label for September and October I might have been a bit more favorably impressed.  It is a bit of a hassle and time consuming with the way it is laid out.  The labels are thin cardboard but get the job done.  Not that flexible for a deluxe calendar and there are better ways to teach the calendar.,3.0
Thought they would be a little thicker and wider.,3.0

Nice book but be aware is oriented toward spiritual or religious sayings.  Was not clear in descriptions and can be embarrassing to give as gift!,3.0

"NO INSTRUCTIONS WITH IT.  When this arrived it is the 1st time I had seen one in person.  None of my friends have one, nor have ever used one either.  I am 71 yrs old.

"I purchased this conditioner as it is a ""more natural"" brand, but I'm beginning to think truly eco-friendly haircare products are a fantasy. While this conditioner smells phenomenal, I find that it leaves my hair feeling less silky than I had hoped. Furthermore, it has a very thick texture that makes it easy to use too much. For the price, I think I would prefer a different conditioner. For environmental friendliness, I think this one is about as good as any other.",3.0

"Hey, here's a review of the 2014 National Parks Art Poster Calendar, in case it's helpful...
This oversized calendar is neat, and the poster art is bright and colorful. And unlike many lesser calendars, there's no nasty hole drilled through the artwork, either! Here's the problem: From a distance, these posters look just great. But when you get closer, you'll see that someone put these vintage beauties through an autotrace software program. So if you'd prefer something faithful to the original artwork - and thus better suited to framing later! - you should look elsewhere.",3.0
"I was really excited about this bottle, it was ordered as a birthday gift. I opened the box the bottle was in, it seemed very nice until I started to peel off the cap liner and notice the cap/lid was already cracked. If the bottle wasn't already cracked, I would have given a 5 star rating.",3.0
"These bottles held up really good for a year, then the plastic lid broke on both of them, within a month of each other.",3.0
"My high frequency hearing loss does poorly with high pitch alarms.  This timer performs the basic functions but is absolutely not what I'd call loud.  I placed it on the louder setting and put the timer on a table between my wife and I.  The TV was on also so when the alarm went off my wife heard it but even from 3"" away I couldn't.

I have no problem with my phone tones so I'm always annoyed when other alarms (travel clocks also) won't make a device folks as I can clearly hear.  The timer portion works properly but I thought it had a repeat timer setting.  It seems to, but only if one reuses it within 10 minutes.  Otherwise it turns itself off and resets to 0.  As I use it to work out daily, the repeat function is nonexistent for my purposes.

It isn't a bad product; just didn't do what I was lead to believe it would.",3.0

I usually enjoy the Alex brand products so was a bit disappointed when this arrived.  Maybe I misunderstood the description but I thought I was buying a paint by number for my granddaughter.  This is Not a paint by number as there are no numbers or directions.

Glasses are nice but a step down from the existing sets we purchased years ago.  Sidewalls are about 2/3rds as thick and the base looks about half as thick. Grooves on the side are not as deep/nice as the old ones - probably because of the sidewall thickness.  I'd recommend them as long as you aren't trying to match an older set.,3.0

Last, we notice that after only using them 3 or 4 times, they have started to break (the tips of a few of the horns have been snapped off). They are definitely cute, but are only marginally functional. It's much easier to eat corn on the cob using a standard two-pronged corn holder.",3.0

"Once attached to the wall, this paper towel holder doesn't work as well as I'd hoped.  The part where one sheet is threaded through (to dispense just one towel at a time and make it easy to tear off) doesn't stay threaded - the towel usually tears off behind that part.  Also, pulling on the towels kinda shakes the whole unit a bit - being a little noisy and probably hard on the wall as well.

You should also note (as I discovered too late) that the holder only loads from one side, therefore I wasn't able to place it in the same location over the sink to the side in matching restrooms or I wouldn't be able to get the roll on and off once it was hung.",3.0

"While rated for indoor use, the specified humidity range extends down only to 25% RH, which is far from suitable for heated dwellings in cold weather.  Surprising, because most other Oregon humidity sensors are rated down to 5% RH.  I purchased two of the BTHR968 sensors for evaluation as well as several other Oregon sensors.  Once the RH drops below about 20%, the displayed reading on one of the BTHR968 takes a nosedive to about 8%.

The transmission frequency stability of both of the BTHR968 units is questionable.  Although they both transmit data every 38 seconds (about 15 seconds apart) according to the LEDs on the units, the transmissions may not be received for over an hour at a time.  Sometimes the data is received regularly from both units, sometimes from only one or the other, and sometimes from neither. Both of these are within 6 feet from the receiver.  Transmissions from other Oregon sensors are received and only rarely miss a beat.",3.0

"I own what appears to be the same grinder but mine is branded Estro.

In 10 years of regular use the only serious problems I have had are:

- a bin that broke ($25 to replace)

- the need to disassemble and thoroughly clean the grinder fairly often.

So - it's durable ... but it's messy and it is very noisy! I can't use it in the kitchen, I have a dedicated table in the basement where it is easier to clean up after I grind enough coffee to last about a week. Lately I have noticed that disassembly is needed more often and some of the plastic parts of the machine are showing serious erosion. When I say disassembly I mean a real screwdriver job right into the interior of the grinder followed by removal of a lot of messy residue and oily coffee gunk.

After reading a lot of reviews I am leaning toward a slow-turning model that will probably cost me more than twice as much but hopefully will not be banished to the basement.

In summary, this is a good high-speed burr grinder that has worked for a long time for me but it's noisy, messy and needs frequent cleaning of its internal mechanism.",3.0
"I've had this grinder for several years. It grinds well - consistant, very wide range of grind sizes. It does, however, make a complete mess of things. As another reviewer says, this machine creates a LOT of static. Grounds go everywhere when removed from the bin. The lid of the bin is also poorly designed.

"I have mixed feelings about this series.  First of all, as far as the way the books are laid out, I like them. There's a nice mix of reading and math or grammar and math and/ or writing.

However, I think the material in the books are WAY off and FAR too easy.  If the idea is to give them busywork, then I guess they've done their job. If the idea is to keep their brain working, remembering what they've worked on during the year, and extending it a bit, then they do NOT do their job.  I am for the latter.  There is WAY too much review from the current year (but the review is too easy!) and not enough of newer/ harder material for the grade level it is supposed to be for.  I ALWAYS purchase one grade above what my girls are actually entering. For example, my entering 1st grader did this book last year upon entering Kindergarten.  I now purchased the grade 1 - 2 book for her upon entering 1st grade.  This one would be far too easy.  It has way too many ""circle the picture that starts with the sound b"" and things such as that.  Things  like that are what the first 2/3 of the book consists of.  It doesn't present any newer 1st grade topics until you reach the 3rd section of the book... by the end of the summer, we usually don't get to that section b/c summer is too short and we are starting to get ready to get back to school already.

On another note, my entering 1st grader will do these books, but they are definitely NOT her favorite ones. (The colorful Hooked On Phonics ones are her favorite.) My entering 3rd grader HATES these books with a passion.  Even though I purchased one of these books for her this summer, she has refused to do it b/c, according to her, ""they are BORING"".  She would rather do pages in the Brain Quest book (again, lots of colors and silly pictures).",3.0

I would pay a bit extra for the same product in a more durable format. I started using my calendar in December 2014 and the binding is already warping while the cover is coming apart.

The columns are a little narrow but they are long which is nice and I like the shading that separates the columns into different areas.

The second sheet of stickers are fine, though.

The calendars aren't big enough to write on, but the schedule by week is perfect. All in all, it's a pretty good planner. If I could see it in real life first, I would buy it again next year. Like I said, it seems as though I just got a dud.",3.0

I looked back at my original email to make sure I hadn't made an error, and I did indeed order the 17 month planner.  The updated order info on my account shows the order as the 12 month calendar, so I am guessing that they ran out of the other one or didn't have enough and decided to give this one instead thinking it would not matter or be noticed?

Iffy - too big for a regular drink holder.

A lot of times, now I've had them a long time, the spout is slow to open & sometimes just releases & I have to use my finger to open the spout.
Despite my best efforts, cleaning of the lid is not as easy as it sounds. I won't get in to the details but my opinion I would avoid the HOT water...it messes with the seal & sometimes it comes off & can be challenging to put it back in.

"I love making kabobs in the summer on the grill, but every time I'm about to grill I realize I am out of the wooden skewers, or that I forgot to soak them in water first. This always sets my dinner time back due to having to run to the store or soak the skewers! I've been wanting a metal set of skewers for a while now. I was worried that the meat and veggies would be too crowded on the rack, but they turned out ok. I just made sure to cut the pieces a little smaller. It's nice that if I cut them too big sometime, that I can still us the skewers without the rack to space them out a little more. One problem is that I tend to make more skewers than what's provided, so I'll still have to buy some more metal ones, or keep some wooden ones on hand for when I have company and am making extra. I like that they are stainless steel, so hopefully they will last a long time and won't rust. The rack also folds in half, and when you open it to lay the skewers on it there is no latch to keep it held open. If you pick it up on the wrong sides, it folds closed! So all the skewers fall off. I had to edit my review to add this-- pretty frustrating. Overall it's ok. I think I'll just use the skewers without the rack, and in that case, I can purchase a set cheaper elsewhere.

"Let me start of by saying I like this more than I dislike it. Solid product with tight threads that don't leak or come loose. The cyclone insert does a wonderful job breaking up contents and mixes them very well.

My two complaints come from all the indents and ledges on the various parts. When ran through a dishwasher they collect large pools of water and don't dry well. They require tipping and pooring along with hand drying after going through the dish washer.

Second is the cyclone insert. After I removed it for the first washing it doesn't go back in as tightly as it came. Maybe I am worried about breaking it and need to push/twist it in further. As a result it sometimes comes loose when transporting and/or shaking it.

In the end this shaker mixes and breaks up powders better than any shaker I have ever used. If the cyclone locked in this would be 5 stars.",3.0

"I really love this soap. But there are a few reasons I only rated it with 3 stars. 1st reason is its price. A gallon concentrate costs $100. It wold be justified if it was as concentrated as the sales says - Instructions say to dilute it 1 to 1 before dosing it depending on uses but after experimenting and speaking with customer support, they told me not to do the first 1/1 dilution and to dilute it less than indicated on the instructions. So I felt kind of cheated. My take is that maybe the person who created the product meant to make it more concentrated but the company selling it became greedy and diluted it... I am not sure but it is a fact of usage that the product works better when it is more concentrated. For ex. they say 10:1 dilution for shampoo but customer person told me to do a 3 to 1 dilution (3 doses of water to 1 dose of soap), otherwise it doesn't work as well. To take out the labels on bottles, I found 5 to 1 doesn't work well. I use it almost pure concentrate. Same for stains on fabric and burnt grease on pots and grills. Wonderful for tar and gum, but again, more concentrate than indicated on instructions. Not working much on hard water stains and calcium deposits.

"I bought these, having read the reviews, rough edges & all.  I thought: one person's rough edges is another person's nice & smooth.  I liked the price, & thought 12 tall spoons to match my 12 flatware set would work nicely.  Nope.  Rough edges were rough edges.  I'm giving them away to my church thrift shoppe, & purchasing a set of two by Norpro, I know they smooth their edges, for a little bit more.  I liked the style & shape of these, the Windsor style, & if the edges had been nice & smooth, I would have loved them.  I do like the simple design & basic shape of them.",3.0

They didn't really look nice enough to serve at my party alongside nice dishware, but I used them anyway.",3.0

The spoons are very sturdy and feel like they will hold up for a long time. They are plain with no pattern on them. They come in a set of 12. I have been using these for a couple of weeks & have run them through the dish washer several times with no problems. For the price I paid I can live with the minor discomfort.

Update to review: I have now been using these teaspoons for 4 months on a daily basis. I run them through the dishwasher after each use. They are holding up well except that they are showing scratch marks. The marks are cosmetic only. As I bought these for personal use only the marks do not bother me for the price I paid.",3.0

"I like this bodywash because it smells nice, not too overpowering, and leaves your skin soft. However, i feel it seriously falls short of a ""silkening"" bodywash. It doesn't leave your skin *that* soft. It prevents my skin from drying out but definitely isn't the most moisturizing bodywash I've used. Aveeno bodywash is definitely better. This bodywash is about as effective as the Ivory bodywash with aloe that I used (except the Ivory was the same price but for 8 oz more bodywash). I won't be getting this product again. If you got dry skin, I recommend something else like Aveeno or even the generic Aveeno look-alike from Walmart (which works pretty well). If you don't have dry skin, then this Caress might be for you cus it slightly moisturizes while having a subtle but very nice scent to it.",3.0
"This whisk is very sturdy and will probably last decades before needing to be replaced, even if you machine-wash it every day. What I don't like about it is the fact that the handle is so much heavier than the whisking portion of the tool, causing it to constantly fall out of pots and off of spoon rests and fling food everywhere - annoying, but a solvable problem. Also, it won't reach into the bottom corners of small pots (which is important when making gravy from scratch, for example) because the ""balloon"" is pretty stiff and doesn't collapse at all - also annoying. This is not a bad tool, it does the job. Keeps the lumps out of my cream of wheat!",3.0
"The other cup was not in stock, but they sent me the one.  I  tried to contact them again and again and they did not respond.  So I coudl not give the pair as a gift as I had planned,.

"The assembly of this unit was a bit difficult as the rods needed to be screwed together and they were not machined in such a fashion to make this and easy task.  I had to use vice-grips to get them tightened and this marred the finish on the rods.  This is not a horrible thing as, once a hose is hanging there, nobody will see the damage.  Like most such items the mounting screws were designed for a wood frame house.  I think there are at least three of these in Florida.  There used to be more but the last hurricane wiped them out.  For concrete block mounting you will need your own hardware.  I use a combination of standard wall expansion anchors and Tapcons.  I chose this type of hanger over some of the others as it allows me to grab the entire coil of hose and just lift it off in one motion for use.  I have the hanger at the edge of my garage behind a short hedge.  It holds about 25 feet of hose and could easily accommodate much more.
Basically this is attractive enough if you aren't hiding it behind a hedge and it is strong enough for its intended purpose once you manage to get it assembled.",3.0

Also, the lines are pretty tiny (like college ruled) and he opts to do them in a separate wide-ruled notebook.  My son is very analytical and process-oriented, so I guess that's why he doesn't get along with this book so well.  I'm in the process of trying to find another alternative since Handwriting Without Tears is creating tears here.  That being said, I personally like the book, and wish I could've learned cursive this way as a child.",3.0
"Used with the ""Handwriting Without Tears Double Lined- Narrow"" writing sheets.  Would have trained the student on how to write clearly and precisely his words in cursive.  Teacher discourage the use of the book and paper.",3.0
"I love the auditory cues of this handwriting program which helps children to form the letters without having to look at the samples.  The teacher gives the auditory cues while the child hears the steps to making the letters.  This was helpful to my boys.  However, I do not like the font, which appears childlike.  My teenage sons handwriting reflects this.  However, they are intelligent.  It is a good program, and I do not want to slam it, but I wish it had a transition program that makes the font look more adult-like in appearance.",3.0
Don't know yet...we have not started using it.  Will use it next month when we start homeschooling. Happy New Year!,3.0
"My 9 year old needs extra help, but I really think what can be accessed on the internet for free is just as good as this.",3.0
This is a journal for camping in a different spot each time.  It's just not what I was hoping for.,3.0
"Nice, but it'd be better if there were slots or areas for a few pictures.",3.0
"This would be a 5-star review if it were based solely on the layout of the content on the pages. Unfortunately though, the material on the outside of the journal has bubbles in it. Almost like the glue didn't adhere to the hard cover, or it got wet in shipping.",3.0
nice.. helps kept track of where you been,3.0
"These make great gifts. They are very well thought out and quite sturdy. However, with all the online blogging and FB, I don't know of anyone I've gifted this to, who uses it. Neat idea though.",3.0
I thought it was great except for the construction.  Also on the other site it can be personalized.,3.0
"I do like the fact that it covers all the basics... contact information, pricing, address/location, etc.  But having only two pages per trip to record everything is not enough.  Would've liked a few ""checklists"" pages for packing for each trip and more than one blank lined pages for additional notes for each trip also.  I like the format, I like the look of the book itself.  Just need more room for the amount of info I like to capture when we camp.  Alot of the info that is recorded is from afterthoughts vs planning beforehand (ie: what I liked most, who I camped with, etc.)  I tend to use my journals more when preparing for the trip, not in hindsight. For those who do write after the fact, its perfect. I still like the journal, but find myself placing large post-it note type pages in for each trip so I can get everything recorded that I'd like to have for reference.",3.0
"It's such a simple device I would expect not to have mechanical issues right off the bat.  Within a couple days of having it a screw fell out of the side and the wooden dowel that connects the two pieces on the back came unglued.

These are easy things to fix so the device is not ""broken"" beyond repair, but I shouldn't have to repair it.  The screw must have stripped out the hole when it was put in or it wouldn't have fallen out so easily.  And the glue that holds the rod on the back should be stronger, I don't know why it fell out like it did.  I can fix it but what a pain.",3.0
"Great poster, but the map is all in French, and wasn't marketed thaty way.",3.0
We love the poster but disappointed that it is not in English The description did not indicate it would not be in English.,3.0
"It's okay, but I've used better, with more organization on the pages.
I'll go back to that one next year.",3.0
"It is a good calendar, but I expected it to be a bit more animated since I was placing it in a room with my triplets. Otherwise it is nice.",3.0
Didnt come with any magnets,3.0
Not quite what I expected.,3.0
"I'm a long time user of the spiral-bound More Time Moms Wall Calendar.  This year I switched it up by getting the Fridge Calendar instead, thinking its layout would better suit our purposes.  Unfortunately it just doesn't work for our family so we're going to get rid of this Fridge calendar and get another Wall calendar instead.

Overall size:
Fridge Calendar  13 1/2"" wide x 16"" high (each month is one page)
Wall Calendar 15"" wide x 11"" high (each month is 2 pages)

Size of each Day box:
Fridge Calendar 1 13/16"" wide x 2 5/16"" high
Wall Calendar 2 1/16"" wide x 3 5/16"" high
If you calculate the area of each box, the wall calendar boxes are 63% larger than the fridge calendar boxes.

Binding
Fridge Calendar: attached at the top of each page like a notepad - each month can be torn off like a sheet of paper.
Wall Calendar:  spiral bound on one edge, great if you plan to keep the calendars as a record of the year.",3.0
"- go to calendars.com for only $14.99! Seriously Amazon, shame on you.. that's ALOT more expensive! What is your margin?!",3.0
I was REALLLLLY excited about this knowing I have hectic schedules with four kids but its an oversized calendar with a bit more room but I can find that in another calendar and cheaper. It works obviously for a calendar but I wouldn't buy it again. Nothing special and I don't see the big hype in it.,3.0
"I love this calendar, I really do.  The squares are huge, they're lined, the paper is thick - all the things I look for in a calendar, except August.  I've used this for many years but here in the US, at least in my state, school starts in August.  It may sound petty but I *need* to start out the year as organized as possible and starting a month late does not do that.  As much as I love this calendar, I have moved over to Amy Knapp's Big Grid organizer, which is not as well made at all- but gives me the tools I need to start the school year out right.  I'm crossing my fingers that MTM finds August soon though because I'd be back in a heartbeat! :)",3.0
"This is a good basic calendar, especially when kids are small and family activities dominate; there's room to write, but space runs out quickly if/when people are headed in many directions. Unfortunately, this version does not have my favorite attribute of MOM products-- there are no family pictures to color. Otherwise, the calendar is as one might expect.",3.0
Good for these kids easy to understand and because of the pictures they can see how to read facial expressions of other students.,3.0
"These weren't as easy to read through the bright colors, as I had hoped for my daughter. She had major problems getting them off the paper they came on, as the color tabs came off WITH the paper. EEK! So I had to take over and handle them for her. I liked how their were extra tabs, like mpas and old/new testament, but wish they had been in a DIFFERENT color.

for the price I probably shouldnt complain, but.....had I known how aggravating they would be I would have spend the extra couple bucks for a different set.....",3.0
Hard to use due to size,3.0
Didn't stay on to well.,3.0
These tabs are not for Catholic Bibles -- there are a lot of tabs missing for Books/Chapters of a Catholic Bible.  This information should have been properly disclosed in the description of the item.,3.0
"The tabs look good and are easy to put on. However I wasn't pleased as about half of them seemed damaged. In lifting up the sticker from the provided paper, the area with the names were ripped off. Basically, some tabs came out ugly because part of the stickers were stuck to the paper they came on so I had to salvage them.",3.0
RETURNED THESE,3.0
Good product. Arrived as promised.,3.0
The tabs are good for my large print bible. The exception is the sticky side bonds are sporadic at best.,3.0
gift,3.0
they okay,3.0
it is ok but I have seen better tabs,3.0
"The ruler that was provided is NOT evenly spaced. I realized this 5 tabs in. Sadly, I felt trying to remove the labels and redoing it would cause my Bible and the tabs more damage so I decided to manually mark the end of each tab before placing the next.",3.0
"You can find a comparison of these to their competitor (Tabbies), and why they are frankly inferior, hee: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/990049346X/ref=cm_cr_dp_cust_img_see_all_txt

Not all bible indexes are created equal. So I took picture s of these and others, side by side, for you to understand the differences that do not come out in the listings... And after all, isn't that what reviews are _really_ good for? ;)

Big Minuses: Too dark, square corners rip pages...",3.0
ok,3.0
The silver rubs off very quickly! If the price wasn't so reasonable I would've rated it lower but it gets 3 stars.,3.0
"the tabs were fine but didn't list: Protestant/King James version only,
nothing for a Catholic Bible.  WHY NOT THAT'S THE ORIGINAL!",3.0
the tabs I brought for my self and a friend and being seniors we found it to be slightly difficult marking chapters and it not to help in locating anything.  It may be that my bible is to small.,3.0
I wanted tabs for a catholic bible but didn't get it.  seems tabs for a catholic bible are hard to find.,3.0
have to be patient to get these on sticks very well,3.0
"I love the appearance of the tabs but as a Catholic, this is not the right set for our Bible.  Maybe I missed this indication somewhere but it wasn't very obvious when I bought them.",3.0
I haven't used the tabs yet.  They are nice as they have each book of the bible already written on them.  I hope to get them in place soon.,3.0
The tabs did not include all the books of the bible.  I was quite disappointed.,3.0
"Few tabs missing. Made Tabs to replace missing.
Tabs that were included were very good. Dissappointed
in those missing. OK",3.0
"I like the tabs, but I was surprised to find the 7 OT books missing tabs.  I was already into placing them when I got to Tobit.  My search was for Catholic Bible tabs and these came up - so it did not think to double check.  The tabs were easy to apply, but did take some time.  They have a good flexible feel and I like the colors.",3.0
Tabs worked will on my wife's bible.  The tabs do not contain all the books found in Catholic bibles.,3.0
"Not for a Catholic tholic Bible e, I was hoping that it had all of the tabs but I now will have to supplement with tabs from another source unfortunately",3.0
It's ok and easy to put on but I should have went through all the tabs first because it doesn't have all the books.,3.0
These tabs are great with one flaw...they do not contain all of the books in the Catholic Bible.,3.0
MEH!,3.0
I found the directions to be too complicated and the application to be far too complicated as well if u place them wrong u risk ripping the page by trying to re-place them. Also they stick out of the bible on the side as well. I ripped probably 5 pages of my new bible :-( ultimately I got them placed but my bible is in rough shape as a result. There's gotta be an easier set out there.,3.0
"These are not the easiest tabs to apply.  They are applied to a page, then folded in half to stick to the other side of the page.  I've used other tabs before that were much easier to apply and to align straight.  These tabs will work alright, but for the money, I would have preferred something easier to apply that gives a neater finished product.",3.0
They were what I wanted but my Bible was not strong enough and several pages tore.,3.0
The product it self is fine.  But the instructions on how to apply them to your Bible were terrible. A person would do better to throw the instructions away and work it out themselves.,3.0
"This, while very good - where just too big for my taste on my small sized Bible.
And they were all ""clear"" rather than multi-colored.  Still a very good deal for the cost
and definetly better than no tabs.",3.0
"Worked perfectly, it even came with batteries. The only qualm I have with this product is that it was stupidly expensive.",3.0
"Always BUY used before the semester, don't pay over the top, never pay more than $40, I paid $42 and its worth less than $20 now..",3.0
"Works great, Has scratches and came dirty",3.0
"I had to pay around 30 dollars for this clicker, used... Ive head 10 dollar clickers that work more effectively in class, looked nicer, and were only 10 dollars.  For some reason the software that goes along with it in my class always glitches and polls incorrectly.  It obviously cost like a dollar to make in China, but still costs well over 20 used usually.  All in all the clicker does what it is supposed to, however, that also depends on the software that your class is using...",3.0
"As I discovered, most universities that this is required at sell clickers in their bookstore that come with the license. This does not. Please do research before purchasing this.",3.0
"I had to buy this for school, but it does work. $45 for this though is pretty steep for a little bit of plastic when all you're doing is pressing buttons to answers on the projector.",3.0
It's okay.,3.0
It does what I need it to do for class but I'm sure it can be found cheaper somewhere. It's nothing special.,3.0
"Cheap, not worth asking price by any means.",3.0
It's almost literally the size of my pinky finger.,3.0
"Very basic device that college students are forced to pay exuberant amounts for because its required for multiple classes. However, it seems to hold its charge very well. I haven't needed to replace batteries and I've been using it daily since late August.",3.0
"Guess it does the job for school, wasn't thrilled at having to buy something like this but it works and is reliable.",3.0
It arrived earlier than I expected. Which to me is always a good thing. I haven't used it yet but it looks brand new.,3.0
I had trouble in  the beginning as the ID # taped onto the device did not match the actually ID # of the device. Nevertheless problem solved and fixed.,3.0
"The buttons on the clicker came with scratches all over the buttons and it is kind of uncomfortable to use, but it works overall. I needed new batteries right away, but it gets long battery life. Overall a good product, but not as described.",3.0
Not a competitive price.,3.0
"The picture for the product shows excellent condition, and it is listed as the 03.  However, I received an 02 version in not the best condition.  Kind of annoying that I paid more for an 03 and only received the 02.",3.0
"Bought this for a required class this semester labeled as ""New."" After the first week of class I was sadly informed that these were cheaper on campus ""New"" than they were from this seller. Works like it is supposed to, easy to register. Good product.",3.0
"The item works as you'd expect, but you are also required to buy a new licence through your institution if you buy a used unit, which nobody tells you until its too late.",3.0
"More expensive than it should be, but I was too lazy to go to the student bookstore and pick it up myself, so I got what I was paying for.",3.0
"It arrived on time. I had no way of tracking it through the USPS. It came without the box or directions that are pictured. Clicker is a little dirty/dusty, but works fine.",3.0
"In bad shape, but works",3.0
This was a purchase I had to make for my daughter.  She needed it for several of her college courses this semester.,3.0
"It's nice to have these on my iPad for my classroom, but these books are so much more user friendly as hand-held books.  In the Kindle version, one book rolls into the next, and you can't self-select between titles easily.  It's hard to tell what book you're reading and hard for first graders to use these books in this format.  A little disappointed, since the ""real"" books are great!",3.0
The story is a little dry for the kids.,3.0
These books would be perfect for a preschool asge child!,3.0
ok,3.0
"I was not terribly impressed with the Meet the Site Words DVD, but the books are a bit better.  We haven't started using them yet because there are a lot of words in them!  Basically, your child has to have all the words memorized before starting the books.  But I can see that they will be good once we have the words down.  One of the frustrating things I have found with Level 1 readers in general is there are different definitions of what Level 1 words are, which can make it frustrating for the child.  So these books are nice in that they cover the same words that were on the DVDs.  What I have been doing in the meantime is picking a site word like he each night during story time and when we come to a he in the story, asking my four year old what the word is to reinforce it.",3.0
nice,3.0
a little weird,3.0
"The calendar has nice photos and the daily squares are just large enough to mark our appointments.  The paper is pretty thin, but acceptable.  I expected more astronomical ""fun"" facts to share with the family, so I am disappointed, as that is why I chose this particular calendar.",3.0
The border came rolled up in a ball which made it difficult to lie flat... Not too pleased with that..,3.0
"Would love to start a debate about learning sequencing and its role in drawing inferences, and conclusions based upon sight since our eyes can often deceived us, and drawing of wrong inferences can quickly lead to wrong perceptions, and hence, wrong conclusions.

Examples of these were exhibited recently both in the press, and in the police killings, of the 12 year old in the park with the toy gun, for example. This may well apply to what we hear as well as what we see. To the extent that teaching sequencing contributes to presumed logic which has no basis, it could be causing confused thinking, not clear thinking.",3.0
I loved these things when I first got them. Within a week they were coming up at the corners and falling apart. It's a shame as it seemed like such a good idea.,3.0
Love the notations and possible teaching guides on back.,3.0
This poster can be used but it wasn't what I really wanted. I ordered it by accident but it would cost too much to send it back.,3.0
Good for our preschool classroom purposes.,3.0
"These fit my students (preschoolers) rather well. I am disappointed in their size. I wish that the cake on the front was larger and sat higher than the balloons and presents.

 They're cute but I would NOT purchase again.",3.0
"This is helping my toddler match her upper case and lower case, but I don't think the pieces will hold up for very long.  Granted, this is geared at older kids who may be more gentle in handling them, but some of mine peeled just when I was popping them out of the board for initial use.",3.0
"Thin, but works out.",3.0
"This bag is nice & sturdy and would be excellent for posters. Based on the measurements given, I was hoping it would be large enough to store our cork board in for transport, but it was just too small.",3.0
"It holds what we need it to (posters), but would prefer something a bit sturdier...maybe thick cardboard or something to keep it upright.",3.0
The title says 35 student pockets. The one that was sent to me only had 30 pockets. I have 32 students so I was not happy with this product. Otherwise it looks great and is a great pocket chart... if we still had small classes.,3.0
"It's ok for the price, but not very sturdy.",3.0
"When I got my case in the mail, I opened it up and it was only 28"" instead of 30"" like it said. I had to cut some inches off my board. Just an FYI to customers.",3.0
The material is is very flimsy. It is exactly what we needed. We are happy with how it holds everything. We just wish the material used was a bit thicker as currently we are worried how well it will hold up with use.,3.0
I was disappointed because even a permanent marker cannot write on the paper.,3.0
"I needed 24 inches of usable space, whereas this item has 23 inches of usable space.  as a consequence I cannot use it",3.0
Top and bottom lines serve as cues in which to place the cards in order.,3.0
"Good product, and clear images;  pictures of actual kids demonstrating the actions; the only reason for the 3 stars is because there are no succinct examples or simple phrases/sentences to describe the sequencing actions. Repetition is the key to learning and when trying to develop language, consistency is optimal; at the point when the child understands the concept, expansion and different variations of descriptive words and actions is the ultimate goal....but first things first: lay down the foundation, then build on it.",3.0
Kindergarteners are tearing them off their desks. They are picking at the corners daily. I even laminated them to make them stronger but the kids are still managing to take the off.,3.0
Used them as name tags for my students on the first day of school.  Cute.,3.0
"I even rechecked the measurements before I commented but it still remains a 1/2 off. I use these as a tool for seat assignments and the size ultimately did not ruin my plans. However, it was still a dissappointment. Still cheaper than buying from store. I checked. so good price.",3.0
Quality is good and works as should. However does not come with colored file folders as pictures.,3.0
Bought this for my family child care and use it to hold the children's art/worksheets for parents to take home at the end of the week. Only used 9 months and one of the pockets already has a tear in it.,3.0
I love the design.  It is very useful for student folders in the classroom.  I am very disappointed in the quality of the fabric.  It is falling apart after 6 months of use.  I have already taped it in a few places.  A co-teacher has the same chart that she bought years ago.  Maybe even 10 years ago and hers is still holding together perfectly.  I would pay a bit more for a sturdy product.  I don't want to have to buy a new one every 6 months!,3.0
It's great except it's already ripping at the seams of 1-2 pockets. Otherwise great for organizing and storing papers,3.0
"The weight of file folders makes it bend and fold towards the center.  I also floats away from the wall, it needs side anchors.  I used hot glue and it's okay.  Great design idea",3.0
Ok,3.0
Holds weight ok.  The seams ripped a little in first day  don't think it was stitched properly. Pretty good overall.  Would purchase again,3.0
"These nameplates are attractive and useful; however, they don't hold up to kids' fiddling. The adhesive isn't strong enough to stand up to fidgety fingers, and once it's up, it won't stick down again. Also, if your desks have any amount of texture, they won't hold.",3.0
So I gave these 3 stars because the price is good and I like the size of these. However I put these on my students desk on Monday morning and by Friday they were peeling on the corners. I have 5 name tags that will need to be place because of course the kids keep picking at them. I'm just glad I have some extra for those ones that are peeling off!,3.0
Ripped after a week of use.,3.0
"I used these for my class but I didn't read that they had an adhesive back.  Unfortunately, they are now peeling and my students will soon be out of a nameplate.  Yes, they are still peeling even though I laminated them. I would use these for a different grade that uses their own desks, not for students that sit at tables.",3.0
"Does not stick well or for more than a day, had to tape over with contact paper",3.0
"These are self stick, and are great for 1st grade. So why not 5 stars? The problem is when you try to take them off the desk. They come off in little tiny pieces. You literally have to scrape them off the desk. When you have 20+ to remove, it is a real pain. Not to mention that all the scraping damages the desks. Thank goodness we are getting new desks and chairs this upcoming school year, so it saved me a lot of time and aggravation. If you plan on laminating them first, it might work.",3.0
"Peel off desk easily, great graphics",3.0
"I couldn't be bothered to cut strips of tape to cover tags on 20+ desks (school was under construction until the first day), so I opted for these this school year. I have had to replace 3-5 in five months and a few others have torn in places or started peeling up, so I had to tape them down. Removal is hit-or-miss...sometimes they come up perfectly, but most of the time they leave a lot of stuck-on paper behind; I had to use dish soap and a paint scraper to remove them entirely! I will probably suck it up and use tape next year.",3.0
"I like the graphics, but they tore or peeled off the desks easily within two weeks.  I was so excited about them, but have had to tape the edges.",3.0
"I was looking for desk nameplates that would stick to the desks. I like the layout of these and the academic features/tools that are on the nameplate.. The only problem is that kids easily peel them, so I have quite a few that are sticking up on the edges or have portions peeled off. They work great for the kids that aren't fidgety and peel their nametags.",3.0
They are good name plates.  I liked that they had a sticky back to attach to desk.  CON - they do not remove easily.  To get them off you have to pick at it.,3.0
Don't love them. The kids pick on them and they come out easily.  I can't see them lasting too long.,3.0
"Didn't realize they were sticky on one side. I laminated them and now they are peeling apart. Other than that, they are just what I wanted.",3.0
Box is not well made. Would have returned it but my grandson really wated stencils and I couldn't find them  any where else.,3.0
"I received two stencil kits as ordered. One kit was missing a stencil. It was a green one, number 10, Fall pictures. The other kit I received was complete. I am keeping both sets, as I do not wish to go to the trouble of returning one set. I will give the complete set to a grandchild as planned and keep the incomplete set for the toy closet at Grandma's house.",3.0
"Some of what is included is several seasons, one of all cats, one of all dogs, one of numbers. They're about 4x6 each so the alphabet takes up 3 different stencils. There is extra room in the plastic box to put more items in. The colors are the same that are pictured.
I love deals, so maybe this isn't the best deal, but the product itself is nice.",3.0
"The stencils are fine, just way too small for my needs.",3.0
Latch on box doesn't stay shut.,3.0
"Stencils not as large as I thought. I can have students use them, though.",3.0
"Since they aren't really detailed, some of the figures just come out looking creepy.",3.0
"Disappointed, way to difficult for pre-schoolers!",3.0
"I agree with the negatives, this wasn't as flashy as it claims.",3.0
These are ok...the kids liked the different theme's.,3.0
This product has been absolute pleasure.,3.0
"Should have listened to the other reviewers.  These are ok - too small for little kids.  My son is four, and got frustrated with these because he couldn't get them to look like what they were supposed to look like.  He enjoyed watching me use them, but he'll need to have better fine motor skills before he'll be good at them.  Good buy, though - just need to adjust the age range.",3.0
"I had Highlights stencils as a child of the 1980s and I LOVED them.  These are a poor imitation!  They are a flimsy plastic; they won't just break but one could easily snap them in half - not nearly as sturdy as my childhood set. The carrying case is very chinsy too - the handle pops off all of the time and the box is easy to deform with your hands. My child enjoys them, but I am disappointed when I compare them in my head to the stencils I had as a child.",3.0
Kind of expensive for the plastic.  Would like to see the price come down.  They do have a lot of options but my daughter got bored with them easily.,3.0
"I bought these for my niece but I tried them out first.  Other than the alphabet stamps the outcome of the stencil gives you a poor, ugly or unrecognizable picture.  I really expected better.",3.0
The stencils are rather small; the box is flimsy plastic and will not stay shut.,3.0
Sturdy enough to trace without having to have a death grip on it so it doesn't move when your pencil pushes against it.,3.0
"The product is s described and shipped quickly. This set is good for basic designs, nothing too elaborate. Anyone can utilize this product. If you need different size letters this is not the set for you.",3.0
Perhaps these are useful for children but as an adult wanting to use them to trace for crafts projects I found the designs very limited and they did not come out very nice looking when I either traced inside the stencil or tried to paint it.  I can't imagine chubby childrens hands doing any better than I could so I question how good they are even for kids.,3.0
Way smaller case that I thought it would be,3.0
Not sure if I'd buy these again...most images are pretty small...and even smaller when you trace inside of the image!,3.0
"The pictures are a lot smaller then I expected. But, it does come in a carrying case. There are several pictures on one stencil which made it harder for my child to use them. It is made from thick plastic.",3.0
"I like the quality of the stencils, but am disappointed in the content. You cannot view all of the stencils before buying. We do not celebrate Christmas and Easter and other such holidays. These stencils are full of holiday pictures. I ended up removing 4 stencils from the set before giving it to my children. If you are looking for a reasonably sturdy stencil set, this one would do.",3.0
"Eh.
The images produced aren't very good.",3.0
"Quality good, but variety of stencils and size could be better.",3.0
"smaller than expected, but kids like it",3.0
"I wouldn't say the quality is poor and the case they come in is nice and closes well. The idea is great. But the stencils - I wish, they were at least twice bigger. I'm going to use it myself in my day care. Strange shapes which are difficult for child to identify. This stencil set is for older children (absolutely not for kids up 4 y.o.)and adults, but even at that it's not worth the price.. disappointed",3.0
These are very nice but the designs a too small.  Good for a teacher or older child but hard to manage for a 3 year old.  Not what I had hoped fo,3.0
"So many choices of things to draw!  Hundreds of animals, plants, and other shapes.  Plus all letters and numbers.  Nice little case to keep them in as well.  I think you have to break apart the 24 stencil squares to fit them in the box at first (used them a year ago so I don't remember).  Not a big deal.",3.0
"I was excited to order this for my four year old daughter who is really getting into stencils.  However, when it arrived, I was diappointed (compared with what I expected after reading reviews) with how small all of the stencil images are.  You really need a fine point pencil or pen to run around the inside edges of many of them; otherwise, the shapes don't really come through.",3.0
Very expensive for what it is.  Strange shapes which are difficult for child to identify.  Not worth the money.  Would return but for the expense of postage.,3.0
Just okay.  Reason I bought was that it came in a small little case for my niece.  It's stencils what more can I say.,3.0
"these stencils are way to thick for the type of crafting that I do, woodwork.  Gave them to my grandson to play with.",3.0
I bought this stencil set for my grandchildren and the stencils themselves are fine.  I believe the picture somewhat misrepresents the set as it is smaller than what the box appears.  I was concerned if the children would have trouble using smaller stencils but since they are well made and thick they do stay in place.  I do not think the set is worth $20.00 but I saw no reason to return them.  They will last well and hopefully be used for a long time.,3.0
"My daughter used stencils at my in-laws awhile back and loved them. They were older ones so nice, sturdy plastic.  I ordered this set as a Christmas gift for her so she hasn't actually used them yet but they are a lot flimsier than I expected. They will probably work fine but for $18+, I expected a bit higher quality. The case they come in, while nice that it will keep them contained in one spot, was fairly low quality as well. The one I got was yellow and it tips over constantly if you have the lid open so I know my daughter will have trouble with that. I will say that the variety of stencils is very good so I will be keeping them to see how they'll work for her.",3.0
"I was a bit disappointed in this product. It is smaller than it looks, and the plastic case I received is yellow, not blue. The case is flimsy and doesn't close well. The stencils themselves are pretty good, just don't depend on the case.",3.0
"I purchased my husband and unfortunately, it is a lot bigger than I anticipated.  However, it is very presentable.",3.0
"This is my first attempt at coloring as an adult and I love it. These pencils, however, do not offer a variety. The colors are earth tones and muted. Another reviewer said too many colors are alike and that's true while too many other colors, like yellows don't even show.
I don't have any reds, blues..that I've found or purples. Any of the vibrant colors.

I'm in search of new pencils and am amazed at how much they cost but these are the flavor of the year so far and I'll pay the price but I'll not get these pencils again.

I will say that these are great starter pencils for me.",3.0
"The color is good and they're much better than regular colored pencils. I believe they are oil based. I had a problem sharpening the pencils without breakage. I have a very good pencil sharpener that holds the pencil in place, so it was my pencil sharpener.",3.0
"I bouht this when I was in Iraq, I like it but it was not that great! enough to keep me entertained in Iraq!",3.0
"I have loved this Vintage Design calendar for years.  Because it is still in keeping with my tastes and decor, I will purchase it but am reluctant to do so.  I feel the artistry has declined, and that makes me sad.  I realize that each year's calendar is by a different artist, but the Vintage Design calendar has become less special to me the past few years than it once was.  It's just okay.  Used to be special.",3.0
"I got this for school planning, as I am a college freshman. The book was small (I already knew the dimensions before purchase), but could manage the job. I liked the stickers it came with.",3.0
I thought I would like this little handy planner. I found out soon that it was a little too small for my needs. If I didn't misplace it I was struggling to write in such a small area. Good quality but just not right for me. I ordered the 81/2 by11 size and love it.,3.0
"A little smaller than i thought i read them to be.
Very nice paper and perfect size to carry with daily for jotting things down
only thing i do wish did not have numbers on them and not sure every single one needs all the xtra pages
with information that i do not need. Would have been nice if they would have taken those pages and made them blank or give more for the date pages to write on.

Love that I can keep them all together once they are done and be handy to look back over the year on.
They fit perfect in my small book i carry with me and can even fit it into my wallet that is bigger than a checkbook size.

To be clear this is not for someone who is used to a high tech way to keep track of your schedule or even for someone who has a very hectic schedule and you need to check very far into your year as you would have to carry around several of them to keep tabs on months ahead.

For myself i did not get these so much to use as a planner but more as a way to always have something with me for jotting down all those things my kids do and say that i wish i had record of as they are growing up far too fast and so many times i wish i could go back and remember something that was said. This way too i can look back at an entire year and see all the things we did together. So yes for my needs i guess will serve more as a daily journal than a planner.

Price I do not think that the retail listed is worth it but maybe if you have someone who is a writer or more on the artsy side or someone who still loves to take pen and paper in hand for their thoughts then when the price is under $20 might make a nice gift for them.

I also have to say if you are someone who is used to keeping track of your busy schedule on a tech device this is no way going to replace that in fact not even going to replace most designs of yearly planners but if you are someone who like myself is looking for a way to maybe jot down a thought or moment as you go through your busy life and want to one day look back at things that happened to your over the year then this is something you could use.",3.0
"but somewhat failed in execution. It is cute when it is all bundled together and there are very small monthly calendars for 2010 and 2011 in each book so you would have to use some sort of short-hand or use the notes section for planning ahead if you only carry one month at a time. Also mildly inconvenient to have to fill out your personal info 12 times instead of just once for a regular yearly/monthly/weekly planner. I usually program events on my cel phone calendar but still like to write things on a regular calendar but these are inconvenient to reference compared to a regular wall calendar. there is also a lot of extraneous information (for me anyway, I am not a jet-setter), I don't have much use for the travels planning/memo areas, time zones map, distances chart, dialing codes, conversions or international sizing chart. also has international holidays, but doesn't say what they are, just what country and what date. A very nice looking set, just not practical to me.",3.0
"I SEE THE PRICE IS GROWING AND GROWING!!!
IT STARTED FROM $13 I THINK AND NOW ITS AT 26 HERE ON AMAZON, HMM....

ANYWAY I CONSIDERED IT BACK WHEN IT WAS CHEAPER (AROUND THIRTEEN DOLLARS) ABOUT A MONTH AGO BUT I DECIDED ON A MORE PRACTICAL FOR ME FORMAT - THE LARGE MOLESKINE WEEKLY PLANNER - I THINK IT'S 10.85 STILL",3.0
I ordered this thinking it was a little bigger than it was.  Still a great planner though. Can't go wrong with a moleskin.,3.0
"Pro's: Fits well in a purse or bag, forces you to not write too much info in a daily planner
Cons: Small size means it may not be useful for those of you who wish to write more detailed notes",3.0
"I beleive moleskines should remain in their classic form.
Books like this are nice. The quality is good, but the value you can extract from them in an era of digital media is very low.",3.0
"These Moleskin planners are very pretty if light on the space to put your content. Each month is a different colored little book which is just slightly thicker than a nickle. The colors are burgundy, red, lilac, pink, green, a neon yellowy color ( technical term!), teal, light blue, navy, deep blue, black, and finally gray. Apparently as the weather gets worse the planner colors get more boring. They come in a tough black cardboard surround with an elastic that wraps around the lot.

I've seen other reviewers say that the set was pocket sized and easy to put in your purse, which I can agree with if you are separating just a planner or two from the rest. But if you are actually planning ahead you likely want to carry at least several months worth together. Now, I have a big purse but if I were to put this into it the set would immediately sink to the bottom, get battered around, and way me down. If you don't keep them in the case they are small enough that you risk permanently misplacing them.

I think the set is more geared toward recording the happenings of your, or your families life for posterity instead of whipping them out to keep track of soccer practices and hair appointments. They would probably be a nice keepsake and far more practical sitting on a desk.",3.0
"In the age of Twitter, FlickR, and Google-mania, I didn't know that there was niche for printed daily planner book. However for those who still believe in old habits of deciphering daily activities in a note book, you are in luck, this is a color-a-month daily planner box that has 12 individual monthly notebooks packaged in a box. One page is designated for each day, and it is good for tracking personal activities. You can record New Year's resolutions, diet programs, achievements, and hobbies. Each notebook has a soft cover, which makes it light and easy to carry. Additional stickers and a color-coded flyer provide tools for easy customization.

I have been using online daily planners for the last five years, and I am quite happy with it. For me online calendars are easier to use and I need not carry with me",3.0
"This daily planner has a very nice feel, and the books are very high quality.  This is very old school.  I would recommend it for someone who does not use high tech devices.  Writers, people who use journals and enjoy writing in notebooks, and artists, might enjoy these planners.  This contains 12 individual monthly planners--one for each month.  Each month is a different color.  This is not practical for a very busy person.  I think someone who has a very busy schedule would get frustrated with this planner, but they probably use an electronic device.  This is very ""artsy."" It is good for either gender.  It's handsome and would make a good gift. It is small and would fit in a pocket.",3.0
"This is a nice notebook, well made and looks nice.  The utility of it is what I might question.  I am not a big wine drinker, I know what I like.  I took it to a wine expert and asked his opinion of the layout.  Wine should be an enjoyment, not a task.  There is value to this if one likes to write in a journal.  With all the available resources both in print and on line, there is not as much need for notes.  If a person is predisposed to maintaining a diary, then on a personal level this is a nice item.",3.0
"This Notebook is absolutely impossible to write in as a man. I can not hold the page open and hold and pen cramped over trying to scribble notes into the small surface area of the book. I would not suggest any man get one of these in this particular size. I would go for one of their larger models, because the pages of these feel so soft, but are fairly durable, and giving someone a note written on a piece of this paper feels very classy. The outer shell of the book is pretty resilient too, and is sealed well by the attached elastic band.",3.0
"Shocked to find that these journals are so small.  The actual dimensions are not consistent with the size advertised.  The description says 64 pages measuring 5.7 x 4.1 x .5 inches.  According to my measuring rule, each one of the three-pack has 64 pages (32 leaves); each journal measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 1/8 inches.  Only if you put the three-pack together, then the thickness is a half of an inch.  Each one is actually one-eighth of an inch thick.  And they are definitely not 4.1 in width.

The item quality is good.  Until now, I could not imagine what I could use them for.  However, I just realised I could use one to record all of my passwords and other special information.  I will now have to look for some kind of disappearing ink so that my information can be secure if the journal is discovered by someone else.",3.0
"People often ask me what I like to listen to and why. I don't always have and answer.

This journal is organized in a that is part journal, part scrap book. I like this notion.

If I were very interested in sharing my thoughts and opinions on music, this would be an excellent way to track them and share them with others.

Sadly, I am not a music-phile, so this journal is more than I'd likely use.

"I have a passion for music unlike anything else on earth. I have kept countless journals over the years which kept specific lists of things like live gigs I attended, albums I listened to that year, mix-tape/CD lists I made, etc. I looked at this journal as a better, more organized way of keeping those journals. I love moleskine journals and have used them for years. This particular one seems a bit all over the place. I would have preferred if it kept more to things like it's ""Playlist"" and ""Concerts"" sections. There you can do just as it sounds, create playlists or review a concert you attended. Instead it goes from sections like ""Lyrics"" to sections like ""Music Map."" I understand I can just make this my own, and re-label, or write whatever I'd like to in any section. Yet, I find myself trying to format my writing to what the book lists as a section. I have used it extensively, however just for playlists and live gigs I've gone to this year. Even a section like ""Album Reviews"" would have been nice. I think moleskine was trying to hard to fill sections in a book. I do use it daily and have begun to just ""make it my own"" in a sense, but I'm hesitant to try other passion journals, though I had originally wanted to. Still would say I like it, just not sure I'd recommend it.",3.0
"I thought that this would be a journal that had nice decorations on the front that I could write my lyrics in, but this is an actual Journal that you keep information of the songs you listen to and how they make you feel.  I don't need anything like that b/c when I hear a song I can go back to what made it memorable for me in the first place, with out a reminder.  I would return it but it has been to long!",3.0
"Not as good as regular watercolor pad. I am using it like a watercolor painter.

If you are using it like a sketch pad, then it is excellent. My fountain pen can run smoothly on it.",3.0
"This planner has a soft shell cover on it, different from the previous one I had that was harder. It is still nice, just not as great of quality as I had expected.",3.0
"I honestly thought this product was large like other day planners instead it was quite small....a little too small for a college student. If I knew the dimensions of the product I wouldn't have purchased it, however that wasn't the case - the dimensions of said product were not in the description. Nor was there an accurate photo of the product being utilized or against something else to verify it's size. I feel rather misled, but I am not doing to return it because it does have use even if it is rather...small.

However it still can be used and the stickers are very cute and useful! However I must warn people that this product though well made is rather small and is not for those who are college students. And would recommend something....larger in order to see what is written down.",3.0
"You really have to dig down to the product description to see how tiny this planner is.  Based on the photo, it looked like the normal sized one you can spread out on your desk.  This one is too small to even stay open on a desk.  Only good to carry around in a pocket.  I returned it.",3.0
"I am a diehard Moleskine fan and this is the second Passion Wine journal that I've owned. I like journaling about my wines, but find that the format of the book is a little limiting. I love the pages where it has placements for all the wine information (region, abv, taste, nose, date, producer, etc) but the second half of the book is mostly blank. I guess I would like this if I knew what else to write, but I prefer the formatted pages. Therefore once I fill those up I just buy a new one. I think they would be better served by keeping the format the same throughout, but that's just my two cents.",3.0

"I was expecting this map to come laminated in the sense it would lay flat and not come rolled in a tube. It's just a more sturdy, shinier paper than regular ones, but it can still crease and wrinkle easily if your not careful. It at least came with attached plastic strips along the top and bottom to add some height so it would hang flatter. Other than that, it's still a good, easy to read political map.",4.0
I really like the map. it looks great on my wall and it being laminated is a plus. But i agree with all the other reviews that it is thin and tears rather easily with push pins if your not  careful. shipping was fast... the things it comes with t hold up are pretty useless too... other than that im happy with the product.,4.0

I THOUGHT THAT WITH THE MANY POOR REVIEWS ABOUT SHIPPING THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT RIGHT BY NOW. NO, IT WAS A MESS, LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN RUN OVER BY A TANK. THE MAP IS BENT AND MAY NOT BE SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO HANG UP, I WON'T.",4.0

"My only problem with this item was the delivery method-super saver shipping with the USPS.  It arrived in a long tube that had obviously been bent in half.  The map itself was dented but not ripped.  I chose not to get involved with the headache of dealing with USPS & Amazon to return the map.  I can live with it.  However, I would caution others to not think economics with this item.  The other options may be more advantageous.  And, if you have a mall nearby, take a drive and get it yourself.",4.0

Very good map. decent detail and nicely laid out. Hoping for a bit larger surface but not complaining.,4.0
its just what my wife and I wanted.  A simple map of the US to visually track locations of visits,4.0
Use it to place stickers on all the places we visit.  Had a similar map when I was a kid hanging on the wall in my room.  Kids will learn geography my osmosis with maps on the wall.  They will study it and check things out and the parents will probably never enven know they are doing it.,4.0
I got this for my elementary school boys. They love it (man I wish I knew something this simple would please them so much). Much better than the unlaminated version which tears very easily. Its very nice to put up even without a frame. Great educational tool.,4.0
"I was very pleased with the product, but Amazon took a product that should have been shipped in a tube and mashed it flat between 2 pieces of cardboard.

example: 100m tall Building built in 1925 with radio antena on top is not three hundred of years old colonial city.",4.0
The map is great for kids.  I love the little pictures that show highlights of the regions.  The only drawback is the lamination.  It's a bit thin - not sure that it would hold up to dry erase markers or being pinned to a wall.,4.0

"I got tripped by the ""Mini"" qualifier in the title of this number line! I was looking for something to help my 2nd grade son with addition and subtraction facts and general computing skills. I thought this would be something to slip under the plastic protector of our dining table, so that when he does his homework, it's right there and we can skip forward/backward to make the math more visible for him. Well, I was not expecting to receive a 'goes on the wall' super long strip of 0-100 number line! I didn't know where to put it and was just about to return it when I found a way to display it on our dining room wall! It took 3 walls to fit it, and thankfully, my son is a little tall for his age so he can still get up there and use his finger/pencil to skip forward or backward and see the math his doing that way! It's useful, and I guess it's a 'mini' bulletin board, but if you're looking for something on the smaller size to go straight on a table, this is not it!",4.0
"Laminated it to last. It's really helped our 4 year old with his counting. Flash cards only go up so high for preschoolers. We have him counting the days he's been in preschool. The repetition, and visuals are great!",4.0

"We purchased this item for our homeschool.  I am really happy with the quality of the pocket chart.  There are lots of extra pieces (birthdays, special days) to use too which is great.

Perfect for my classroom. Large numbers and nice months with photos. Comes with birthday and holiday cards too. Love it.,4.0
"Good size and works well. I only wish it had more holidays and such. There is no real place to store the extra months up top (it will sag if you try), so you'll have to keep them elsewhere.",4.0
"I really like this calendar, I bought it to replace a poster board calendar we were using before.  The kids love putting a new number in each day and practicing their counting.  In order to accommodate those months that need six rows of numbers I opted to print smaller days of the week names that slip into the month area.  Overall the included tiles are a bit too big and unattractive for us.  My husband even asked where our cute numbers had gone :) So we use this our old number and month tiles and the stuff it came with is in the basement as art project fodder.",4.0
"The calendar is great - beautiful pictures, nice big cards, etc. The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is because the number and month cards are not perforated for easy separating. You have to carefully cut each card out, following the super thin black lines. It's very annoying. Other than that, I am extremely pleased with this and can't wait to use it in my first grade classroom!",4.0
"This is a large, brightly colored pocket chart.  It's light and easy to hang, however sturdy enough to withstand my 2-year old taking it down every so often.  The only thing I wish it had were more cards for holidays and events, but as a basic calendar it works very well.",4.0
"I have lost two different calendar posters in my constant moves so I am hoping this will fold up and pack up more easily. Aside from that, I have another calendar motif that I really like and it also fits into the pockets nicely.",4.0
"I use this calendar to teach my son months and days.  We look at it every day.  It is just the right size and is of nice quality.  I would have liked it if there were more special occasion days, like beginning of seasons and holidays, but I would say that it is perfect otherwise.",4.0

I am using this classroom calendar in my preschool room. I laminated all the pieces and used velcro to make it kid friendly. I really like the real pictures and how easy the numbers are to see. We're all enjoying it!,4.0
"I really like this calendar for my kids! I love that it has realistic pictures. We have printed/made our own special picture cards with family pictures & it doesn't look out of place. My kids love the added personalization. We also printed little clipart pictures to help them know when different activities are coming up (ie: swimming lessons, play dates, etc).

I give this 4 stars because it's not just ready to hang & use when you take it out of the box. The paper of the calendar/days/pictures is pretty thin. I wanted it to be a hands-on calendar for my kids so I had to get it all laminated at our local copy/print store or it never would have lasted a month (we've had it about 3 months now). Also, whether or not you laminate it you need to get something to hang all the pieces on the big yellow background. After laminating I applied Velcro dots to all of the pieces. For the smaller clipart pictures I used packing tape to make my own lamination & we use sticky-tack to hang them on the appropriate days.

Even with the extra work I love this calendar. It has really helped my younger children (5 & 3 years old) get a better understanding of days, weeks, months & weather. We will certainly be using this for years!",4.0

"A teacher's day is long and there is a lot of paper coming in and going out. I picked this up out of desperation, frankly. So glad I did.

I have two folders for each class - work that needs to be graded and work for missing students. When a kid is absent, I take the work and put it in the MIA folder. When I collect work to be graded, it goes in the appropriate 'to be graded' folder. When I am leaving for duty or prep (someone uses my room during prep), I can grab the folders and have the work I need to grade.

The material is heavy duty ripstop nylon and I hold it to an unused blackboard using 3M heavy duty hangers. It's working aces.",4.0
Handy.  I use it to store my books on tape in my listening center.,4.0
Great product. Good quality.,4.0
nice buy,4.0
I have not yet attached as I have wallpaper and I am concerned about damaging it.  I know I can use the command hooks but have not yet purchased it to utilize this holder.  It is like I envisioned so it should do fine.,4.0
It works for purpose that I purchased but only 10 pockets not 13 as advertized and no see thru pockets.,4.0
"This thing is attached to my wall with thumb tacks and is currently holding an insane amount of paper, magazines, and books. It is very sturdy!. It does bow out if you overfill it as I have done, but it is still holding up. I am very happy with this purchase!",4.0
"I needed something to organize random papers that always seem to find their way into my office! It is not the most attractive organizer (might use it in my classroom instead), but it hangs nicely and holds all those extra papers that clutter up my office!",4.0
"The only thing I found difficult was that it wasn't clear on the web page how to choose different colours.  It said there were different colours, but not how to choose them.  The product is fine.",4.0
"This product organized our stuff well, and hung on the wall nicely where we placed it.  4 more words required.",4.0
"I needed something to keep all the kids' school forms and paperwork off my dining room table, and this worked well for that.  I hung it on the interior of our coat closet with some temporary hooks, and now I have an ""organization station"" that is tucked neatly out of sight.

These storage pockets can fit quite a bit.  I unloaded a box of 50 envelopes into one pocket, my date calendar and notepad into another, and used the rest for kids' paperwork, magazine clippings, articles I want to keep for just a little while, miscellaneous coupons that come in the mail, etc.. (all the stuff that doesn't have a ""home""), plus home project files I like to have at my fingertips.  So far, I've only filled up half of the organizer!

Really glad I purchased this.",4.0
"I love this thing. I docked it a star because it doesn't come with it's own hooks or folders. I just use 3m hooks and got my own folders. It's a plasticy type of material but that's ok. It's perfect to store my business in/out, paid/unpaid, etc receipts.",4.0
"Its a bit flimsy, but gets the work done. I have it next to my desk, and it keeps papers organized but easy to reach.",4.0
"I am sure this would work wonderfully for teachers but I have used it within my home to organize mail, paper, and bills.  Most of the pockets are pretty deep.  The top pocket is not so it is a good place to store receipts for filing.  For most of the pockets, I use folders in order to easily remove all the papers associated with the pocket in one easy movement.  I pin the unit on the back of a door so it doesn't take up primary wall space.  I really like it and would recommend it to those who have a lot of paper that they need to process.",4.0
This Pocket organizer has helped tremendiously with school papers and library books. I labeled the pockets by using masking tape. Mon-Sunday. Misc and Take-out! Very helpful organizer for my family! Much better than putting papers in piles on my kitchen table.,4.0
I bought this to use as a mail organizer for my employees. It works well. I love it. It seems durable enough. I am happy with it and would recommend it.,4.0
It feels a bit flimsy. I should have noticed that it was polyester. I was hoping for some studier canvas or something. My bad. It's been holding up so far so we'll see how it goes.,4.0
"I bought this item for my students and it is really very helpful. I put the students folders that they need to take home daily and their work, so it works as mail between us teachers and parents. The only thing is the after 3 days one pocket tore off for no apparent reason. But I still like it a lot and I think it helped us see who is missing what.",4.0
This Instructional Planning Book is great for beginning teachers especially as an ESE teacher.  The CD is very helpful also.,4.0
"It's great for differentiation tips and there's more room to write than in a regular plan book. The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because the CD that came with it was wedged so tightly inside the front cover that when I tried to remove it, the cover started to tear. I have ordered this plan book before and did not have this problem.",4.0
Cute but I wish it was a little more sturdy or pre laminated. My little ones ripped 2 of the accessories within minutes but after some tape and an afternoon with a laminating machine our panda is good to go!,4.0
Very cute and my toddlers love the Panda bear.,4.0
Huge panda! Kids love dressing it!,4.0
"Cute and bright colored, will be great for the school room. Prefect for my kindergartener and my Pre-schooler. Super cute",4.0
Very simple and cute alphabet.  This goes with my classroom monster theme.  I would have liked to have had monsters that matched the sounds of each letter.,4.0
"Letters and numbers are large enough to see across a room, plus monster designs are added fun without too much distraction. Only complaint would be the border curled and would not lay flat after hanging.",4.0
"I was looking for a number chart for my daughters to have a visual reminder up of their number.  It is a big, bright, and colorful chart.  I just wish it was laminated.  I am afraid it won't hold up over time.",4.0
"I love this poster and its colored and have actually ordered all the matching ones, but when I opened the package there were several smudges on the poster.",4.0
"Great pocket chart, just make sure you are wanting to buy a smaller sized one.  It's not very big.  Check the measurements!",4.0
"This takes care of the ""What time is _________?"" question.  I wish there were more pre-printed tags with the set.  I've made a few extras so I'm not constantly changing the times for different schedules on different days.",4.0
"I've been tired of yelling at my kids all the time, telling them we are running late. I tried a couple homemade schedules, but decided to try this after seeing it in the classroom. It has helped tremendously. Wish it came with more blank inserts, but I am using it for home rather than school.",4.0
This is a good poster for my daycare circle time.,4.0
We have this up in our hallway so our daughter sees it enough to keep her interest. We count together and she is definitely learning from it!,4.0
Great product! I wish it came with pre-cut clock numbers!,4.0
"I am a first grade teacher and have used this schedule in my classroom every day. It is a great management tool so you don't have students asking when something (lunch, specials) is all day. The pocket chart comes with the most basic subjects (math, science, social studies, art, music, gym, reading, lunch, recess) and a few extra blank ones so you can make your own. The best part is each subject has a picture with it so if your students can't quite read yet (k-1) they can still recognize the subject. The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I think it needs more blank cards or they need to add some subjects or activities becoming more common like Health, computers/iPads, centers, guided reading, Library/Media, assembly/special school activity to this pack.",4.0
"I have an extremely detailed schedule and this would be perfect if it had about four more slots for more time cards. Since it doesn't, hence the 4 stars and not five.",4.0
This chart was just what I needed for an area in my classroom.  It worked great at holding students name cards in place.,4.0
Good product,4.0
"I don't change this chart often, so my students don't tend to notice it. It is more for me, as my students are in kindergarten.",4.0
Works great!!  Exactly what it said.,4.0
Just as expected. Needed a visual schedule and this does the trick.,4.0
"Great for Homeschooling kids who always want to know ""whats next"" or ""when will we do..."" or ""when are we going to be done"". The Blank cards are easily reproduced in a home printer/scanner. Over the summer i used completely blank strips of card stock and listed our events by date.",4.0
"My kids are pre-K. I ended up laminating the cards and turning them over. I simply wrote things that we do. Ie. ""Opening"" ""Discussion"" ""Lunch"" ""Lego Building"" ""Music"" ""Snack"" ""Park"" ... I remind my toddlers about things that are coming up and check off items as we complete them. They enjoy knowing what's going to happen-- and I enjoy knowing that I've completed everything.

The only downside for me is hanging it in my home. It's not the most aesthetic home addition.... I hang it from a tension rod and use those link clips in the holes. Then I take it down at the end of the day.. or whenever we have company.",4.0
I like this for a second grade classroom. I do wish there are a few more blank cards with everything we do in a day,4.0
Wish the pockets were deeper but it works for its purpose. Use it daily for classroom schedule in Transitional Kindergarten.,4.0
This is a nice kit to use for your schedule . I love that it has the two ways to display the time .  It is the size it says in the description not huge but I feel it is big enough . I do wish it had a Library card. It does have 5  blank cards.,4.0
Very useful in a classroom. I just wish that it will come with more blank cards to adjust to subjects.,4.0
works great,4.0
"I use this in my classroom to count the number of days of school.  I really like the concept and layout, but the straw pouch is not deep enough and does not hold many straws.  The numbers do not conveniently fit in the pouch either. However, I have easily solved this problem by stapling 2 small containers to my bulletin board - 1 for straws, and 1 for number cards. This works very well and gives me the space I need to search through the numbers without knocking any down. I still have to store the remaining straws in a separate drawer, but I am grateful for the abundance of materials. I would still recommend this to others.",4.0
"Looks to be a well-made product, as most Scholastic items are. I do have couple of complaints, however: 1) the velcro pocket at the bottom does not hold all of the straws; 2) there are not enough straws to allow for bundling up ten ""ones"" so kids see it as a ""ten"", you apparently just move one of them into a tens position and start over with your ones, and that holds true for the hundreds as well, just placing one straw in for a group of ten ""tens"". There are between 200 and 205 straws total (I was interrupted several times counting...). Overall, a good product for the price, and if you just want to count the number of days you have been in school, this would be fine.",4.0
Nice set.,4.0
This came exactly as expected! You have to cut everything out yourself and the straws are exactly that but perfect for my classroom.  I like the little pocket at the bottom to store all the numbers in.,4.0
"I like it. It is a really great pocked chart. I would not use the straws (and do not). I use place value cubes to show the students how every time we have 9 cubes, the next day we will have 1 stick and no cubes. When we have 9 sticks the next day we will have 1 square and no sticks. I use this as a ""how many days we have been in school..."" thing. The straws kind of are a pain and they look a little tacky.",4.0
"Just what I needed to teach my students place value during daily calendar. I took off a star because you have to cut out the numbers, and it doesn't come with rubber bands to wrap up the 10 bundles.",4.0
"Great time saver for a maths group or for a fill-in while I teach another group. Reasonably sturdy construction. If the sticks disappear or break (!) they can easily be replaced with drinking straws. Once you teach the concept and the kids catch on, they really enjoy the process. Operates well with a top student helping or monitoring a lower group.

I got what I expected. It's easy to use. You just have to have hooks for it to hang on since it doesn't come w/any. It works great and isn't flimsy or anything.,4.0
"I purchased this product for my 2 year olds room. After spending over an hour searching for different calendars to put up. She loves apples and that is what kept drawing me back to this one. I love the days of the week, weather (though it would be nice to have more than they provide but it does just fine) and the added celebration cards. The only thing (which is why I rated 4 instead of a 5) I wish they would have made reference in the description is the apple is cut in half. Goes right through the E in WED. I spent over 20 minutes trying to line it up and tape the back before I attached to her board. I wish they would have made it all 1 piece. I also do not like that instead of the number of the week you can only have space for the number or a special day. (Though you can plainly see that in the picture)
I defiantly am glad for this purchase and hope others are as well.",4.0
I'll be using it for my classroom great product!,4.0
Pockets are not quite as deep as I thought they were.,4.0
This is a good quality product. I took one star off simply because the plastic across the front tends to bend out when I put cards in it and this makes it difficult to read at times. If you are using sentence strips or something not much taller than the clear plastic it should work fine.,4.0
Nice product came quick in good condition.  It is a great product for homeschool and maybe even a class their isn't a lot of hand contact but its not the sturdiest I've seen but for the price point its worth it!,4.0
You get exactly what you see. Good product for the cost.,4.0
"I find that the ""pockets"" are not as deep as I would like them to be.  I have an older Carson Dellosa on that I like better.  But it does work and is durable and will last a long time.",4.0

"We used this for African American History Month in our school's library. The posters were informative but we felt that we needed to laminate them to make them more durable. Overall, they served their purpose and I would recommend them",4.0
"I didn't want a poster that had heaps of useless nonsense on it. I just wanted the alphabet and while this does have pictures, it's not cluttered. It appears to be a good poster, but had a wee bit of a crinkle when it arrived.

For some reason, I thought it was going to arrive laminated. Part of this assumption probably stemmed from the fact that I got a Numbers poster from Barnes and Noble and it was laminated and the total cost was around $4.50 plus tax. There was nothing to indicate it was laminated however.

Over all, it appears to be fairly sturdy card stock, but if I had known it wasn't laminated (I'm getting that done today), I would not have purchased it.

It's going in my daughter's bedroom so she can look at the pictures. I sing the alphabet to her (she's just under 9 months) and I want her to become familiar with it so that she will hopefully find other things easier later on. I don't expect her to comprehend what I'm saying now, but be comfortable with it when it comes time to actually learn.

It's not a bad picture. Would have loved it to have been full poster size, but it will do the job and the price was definitely right.",4.0
Only complain was N for nine and Q for quilt,4.0
Great for circle time.,4.0
"Nice pictures and colors and clear letters.  My pet peeve with alphabet posters though is when they choose a picture that starts with a blend instead of just the one letter (example from this poster: T is for train, which doesn't start with the phonetic sound that ""T"" makes)",4.0
"I wish it had some sort of theme like animals or nature, but the cup cake? That was the first time I saw that for C. BUt they get an A+ for originality.",4.0
"As a kindergarten teacher, I picked this chart for my own little one.  I love the colors and the real-life pictures.  I loved the font and the size of the pictures too.  I would give this a 5 star but can't help but wish they had chosen something else for the ""o"" picture as it doesn't represent a true short ""o"" sound and something else for ""x"" as the ""x""  makes a ""z"" sound in their picture.

I thought it came with the pocket chart.  I guess I did not read the description right.,4.0
Product is ok but my daughter doesn't really enjoy using them. Would be nice to have the board and letter tiles magnetic to stay in place.,4.0
Great for learning to read and spell. I've never liked dry erase crayons. It's hard to get off and you have to push hard to get it to write which leaves an indentation on the mats. We are using dry erase markers from now on.,4.0
"When I used them, they were exactly what I had expected!  I would highly recommend this item for your classroom.",4.0
Exactly what I needed for my classroom. It does not take up  a lot of space which was something that was really important to me. It has everything you need to just unpack and put the schedule together with no hassle.,4.0

"Only one catch - pockets and Spanish language add ons sold separately. Nonetheless, I do like it and it is a must have in the Elementary Spanish Classroom.",4.0
"Although, yes, the material is cheap (I think it is reasonably priced) the functionality of it still allows for variety of organization.

My recommendation is to get darker colored nail tacks from Orchard Supply and this way the Organizer stays flush with the wall rather than sagging. If you hate putting holes in the wall, the sticky adhesive may do the trick but not as wall as the nail tacks)

Great for all sorts of things, I put in clipboards and it helps me clear my desk. I also ordered more of these because its another way to store colored paper.

I am grateful they had these in black because it goes better with all the colors and design clipboard I put in.

Thanks for making these! I wish they had them when I was in school but am loving them now.",4.0
"The build quality of the hanging file is pretty good. I can tell the material is durable and holds together well. The pockets have adequate room for most uses, but standard pieces of paper will bow over top heavy over time unless you lay them on their side (long ways). There are three holes in the top of the folder which provides hanging options and the holes are reinforced with metal - nice touch there.

Con: some folds remained in the item due to being folded during shipping. Hopefully, these fold creases will disappear after the item hangs for a while.",4.0
As described,4.0
It does what it is meant to do. The material is a bit flimsy.,4.0
Functional and serves the purpose of holding lightly filled folders well. The fabric is thinner than I expected but has worked this far. It hangs on walls perfectly. I used 3m hooks so that I could hang it inside a closet rather than over the door.,4.0
I bought these as a gift for my niece who likes to play school. She has a lot of papers. I was a little disappointed they didn't come with the folders as shown but they are great for what I was looking for.,4.0

My daughter loves the dictionary. its a very helpful tool for grade school kids.,4.0
I bought this dictionary to grow with my Kindergartner over the next couple of years.  She LOVES the color and plentiful pictures that accompany the entries.  The only down side is that about half of the words we've tried to look-up aren't in here and we've had to pull out the adult-level dictionary as a back-up.,4.0

This planner is very basic and has the days going vertical down the side and the subjects going across the top. The subject spaces are blank and are not preprinted. I like the planner because it is adaptable and can be used for other uses. I use it as therapy and supplement record book for my autistic son. I can keep up with things we do for therapy on a weekly basis and track his progress. Would recommend to anyone wanting a basic planner that you can write in.,4.0

"There is a version of this stylus that offers a pen.  I couldn't find it for a cheap price and also was worried about how well the clip/pen cover would stand against coming off and loosing the main part of the stylus.  This review is for the plain, Nook Vara Stylus with no pen.

This is my first time owning a mobile device, so this is also my first time using a stylus.  I received a cheap, red, 'regular style' stylus/pen combo with another purchase almost the same day I got the Vara.

Comparing the two stylus side by side:

The red one fits in my cover's stylus loop while the Vara is far too thick.
The Vara clip is one molded piece; the red has a normal 'attached metal' construction like you see on most pens.
Vara is 1/2-inch longer.

Point tips appear to be the same type of rubber, but on touching them with my finger the Vara is about twice as hard to push in.  It feels much sturdier than the red's which caved all the way under the same amount of pressure.

The red is slim and round feels like hard plastic while the Vara is thicker where most people would grip it, has a rounded square construction to the barrel, and feels...nice.  Firm rubber.  Definitely a win for the Vara.

Disappointment that the end of the barrel securing the tip is metal like that of the cheaper brand.  In the same color of black, I thought at first it was rubberized as well.  That would have added a touch of safety for the tablet screen should the tip ever come off (as I've read happens with all kinds of stylus brands.)

I'm going to use the red for when I take my Nook out of my home.  It fits snug with the cover and has a handy pen.
However, for regular use around the house I'm going with the Vara.  The soft, contoured grip just feels great on my hand.  Much nicer for long hours with the tablet.",4.0
"So far so good. The shape is comfortable in my hand. I use it on all my electronic hand- held devices. Since I've only had it for a couple of weeks, I'm waiting to see how long it lasts.",4.0
"An aesthetically pleasing design, comfortable to hold, with a soft matte finish. It fits snugly into the spine of the Industyriell Cover in Carbon (now half-price at B&N). However, one design/manufacturing flaw. Although the clip fits nicely on the cover's spine, after a few months of use, the clip broke off. No warranty on the stylus, so you have to buy a new one. After buying this new stylus from Amazon, I noticed that Walmart offers it with a 2-year replacement option for an extra $4.00. Not a bad idea for Amazon to duplicate.",4.0

"This was exactly what it looked like. But the same day I put it on my key chain, the top of the shoe fell off. This shouldn't happen the first day you get it. Not happy, because it's lost.

They messaged me and replaced it immediately. Great and friendly customer service.",4.0

The finish shows normal wear around the hard edges.

Some people have said that this keychain is too ""small"", but I find it to be the perfect size. If it were any bigger, I wouldn't want to carry it on my person.

"It has great build quality, has a nice weight to it.  Unfortunately it scratches extremely easy, the finish doesnt last at all which is a shame because it really is a great looking item.",4.0
Very good heavy construction.,4.0
very nice.,4.0
really adorable valentines..I used them as party invites and everyone loved them,4.0
These little cards are so adorable and beautiful. I would highly recommended.,4.0
"I saw and bought two pkgs. of these at a bookstore. I will be giving them out at a nursing home. I think I paid just under this price for them. They are sweet, not as large as I would like... the envelopes (all white, with a pink pattern on the inside) are just under 5.25"" x 3.75"", so the cards are just under that size, but they were so sweet and traditional. I think the recipients are less likely to get duplicates of these. Inside of the cards is blank, I added a verse and the story of St. Valentine.",4.0
"These little Easter cards are delightful....designs, a lot of victorian style....I was disappointed that they are really small....and it is probably my fault that I didn't read the order info carefully enough....what I did was enclose one of the small cards inside the regular sized Easter Cards that I sent.  I did get a lot of nice comments on the little guys....and I probably will order more of these for other Holidays just to enclose!",4.0
"These are cute cards but small.  The box may be 3.5"" x 5"" but many of the cards are much smaller. Only two cards had an Easter greeting on front of card and they were all blank inside.  Gift card does best describe these cards which is what they are called in the detailed description of product.  I will use them for small notes to young family members or as gift cards on packages.",4.0
"I got exactly what I was looking for, in terms of Easter-time cards.  They are without sentiment though, so can be used generally for spring too.",4.0
This pen is nice. Great quality. The pen is tail heavy. It's weight is mostly in the tail end. I love the bolt function and the ease of deploying the pen. It's just not balanced. But it writes great and is a solid piece. It would definitely hurt someone.,4.0
Works as advertised,4.0
Exactly what i expected a heavy duty brass pen. clicks smooth it is a well machined piece of brass. Only getting a 4 because Parker pen refills do not fit nicely into this pen. Its actually the Parker refills fault. The Ink cartridge the pen comes with Is perfect and looks excellently made but i needed blue ink so bought Parker pen refills in blue ink. The Parker cartridges are very poorly made compared to the cartridge that came with the pen. I Had to FILE the Parker cartridge to get it down around the tip so the tip could slide through the pen like it was meant to. So because there are no other cartridges other that Parker that i could find i give it a 4.,4.0
good product !!!!!!!!!!,4.0
"A little about me: I love narrow rule. I love good paper that lets me write with gel pen and doesn't ghost a lot. I am constantly on the look out for a journal which has both of those, and also does not have dark lines that contrast a lot with the page. It's a lot to ask, I know. ;)

I LOVE this journal. Quality paper, and the narrow rule lines are printed well. The ink color is perfect -- a comforting gray which doesn't jump off the page at you. :) Also, the cover is buttery soft! It's a pleasure to hold. Oh, and it lays flat pretty easily.

My only complaint is that the label and cord make an imprint on the cover, probably because each is also wrapped in clear plastic. I have unwrapped the ones I intend to use as gifts in the hopes that the marks will fade. For me, I don't really care, because the insides are so nice.",4.0
Great journal. Smells a little funny (fishy) at first use. Hopefully it wears off. Table of content pages are very thick. Nice small pocket inside back cover.,4.0
"Nice quality. The cover is super soft. The pages are thicker paper, higher weight than notebook paper. I love the organization of the book.
Great gift or for yourself!

"I purchased originally purchased this journal on Amazon for the purposes of keeping in my vehicle glove box as a service record. Due to its size and the elastic closure I thought it would be perfect for that, but once it arrived and I discovered how beautiful and well made it was there was absolutely no way I could fathom using it for that purpose and have adopted it as my 2016 personal journal.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Softcover-Writing-Notebook-Table-of-Contents-185-Numbered-Pages-Archival-Stickers-Premium-Ruled-Paper-5-75-34-x-8-25-34-Expandable-Interior-Pocket-Bookmark-Perfect-Bible-Journal-or-Diary/dp/0692499555/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Softcover Writing Notebook: Table of Contents, 185 Numbered Pages, Archival Stickers, Premium Ruled Paper 5.75"" x 8.25"", Expandable Interior Pocket, Bookmark.

 Although I do point out in my review summary at the bottom of this page that the journal makes a faith-based charitable contribution per journal sold, and the product description itself is forthcoming in disclosing this, It may be noteworthy to add that the journal itself contains religious references. I, myself, am not a person of faith and I do recall being a bit disappointed with this aspect of the journal, especially since the religious references are located on the inside cover(s), and as such are not  pages one would necessarily consider removable.

This is simply an exquisite journal. The solid black slightly textured cover is gorgeous and so soft, it feels wonderful in your hands. The pages are of such high quality and absolutely do lay flat for journaling just as the seller indicates. The seller's pictures, while accurate, just do not do this journal justice. It has far exceeded my expectations.

 Noteworthy Features:

 Very Soft and Beautiful Cover.

"This is a beautiful, little notebook. The cover is a solid black and very soft, but seems sturdy. The pages are a nice thickness and it doesn't seem like ink will bleed or smudge. There's a built in ribbon bookmark and an elastic strap to hold the book closed. The packaging and the inside of the cover does indicate that it's designed to be a bible study notebook. It's subtle enough that it doesn't impede it's use for a plain notebook, but it is there. This is a very nice, professional looking notebook which I'm happy to have.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",4.0
"This for me is the perfect solution to keep track of to-do's. The system works very well when you are dealing with constant priority changes in tasks. 5 notes per page seemed like a waste of space originally, but i am finding that it gives a good representation of top priorities. The only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars is that the pad of sticky notes will start falling out very quickly. A simple corner ledge would solve that. For now I use a large document clip to hold the sticky notes which is a nuisance when you need to make a new entry, but the benefits still outway that minor item.",4.0
Definitely got me more consistent with my morning routine.,4.0
"A great resource if you, like me, are trying to become a ""morning person."" I can't give it 5 stars, however, because I think it's overpriced. If they lowered the price to $24.99 I would be telling everyone about it.  It's just too expensive to recommend wholeheartedly.",4.0
I REALLY love the journal. But was very disappoibted on the binding. Mine came apart Day 2!!!,4.0
"I LOVE this journal. I have never been a morning person. For years, I have been the person who hits the snooze button 10 times, gets out of bed at the last possible minute, and flies out the door late and disheveled. I ordered this journal at the beginning of the new year, looking to make a change. It has 100% made a difference. I love having something that helps me keep track of my morning routine on a daily basis--it holds me accountable and helps me organize my goals, which motivates me to keep going. The only reason why I did not give this journal 5 stars is because the binding was damaged when I received it. I thought about sending it back, but I was anxious to get started, and the damage did not impact my ability to use the journal, so I decided to keep it.",4.0
Good outline for a daily journal. Im looking forward to  using it.,4.0
"This journal is very thoughtfully laid out.  Clearly the authors put a lot of time and thought into it.  I've made a few modifications a couple of sections of the daily entries, and now it's becoming a powerful daily tool for me.  Nice job!",4.0
Using it for the first time. Gave it 4 stars because this is my first day using it and don't know how much it'll help yet. I do love the layout and well put togehter it is to motivate you every day and helps you keep accountable different from what I've seen out there,4.0
"Nice color scheme and printing. Good sized, clear and as far as I can tell, very accurate. Thanks for making this product with the proper world view.",4.0
I thought it was going to be too small but it ended up being something I could work with.,4.0
"I am pleased to have purchased these postcards. [...]. I'm always looking for unique postcards to send, and there are many of those in this batch of 100 postcards.",4.0
Like many of the reviews said the box broke as soon as I removed the paper. I even tried to be gentle opening it up due to the reviews but Mine broke as well.  I really enjoy these cards because of the typography used. I love studing typography and for an graphic design student I got some really good insperation! Deffently a good buy and will even frame some of the cards for the spare bedroom and the rest send to by postcard buddy in ABQ in New Mexico!,4.0
Great price for that many postcards.  The box totaly fell apart though.  The box made great kindling wood!,4.0
"I had the box side half break away upon taking the cellowrap off, but the postcards were very good quality. Other reviewers mentioned text/graphics. True! I was looking for witty cards to send out and so far this is the best mix I have found on Amazon. My favorite was the man working sign, and text that I love work, I can sit and watch it for hours. Something like that. If you need postcards that will be noticed and kept, buy these. Or frame a few that you really like. Pssst! it's a nice set, even with the flimsy box.",4.0
"Im giving it four stars instead of 5 because the ID code on the back of the i<clicker was VERY hard to see. It was either rubbed out by years of use or someone tried to get rid of the code before they sold it. I got lucky and was just able to make out what the code was so I could register it for my class.
Aside from that everything else was great. It came on the exact day it said it would, and it was in good condition. It did not come with batteries so be sure you buy some AAA batteries.
That being said, you never know what you're going going to get with a used item, and this one is basically half the price of what a new i<clicker is on the market, so if you don't want to spend $40.00 on a brand new one, then I would say this is probably worth the risk.",4.0
Used for a class which was an innovative way to participate.,4.0

"Purchased because my university required this clicker for use it class.  Pretty standard, accurate, no issues.  Only tip I can give is to write down the ID on the back as it is used to register your clicker.  The ink used fades pretty quickly and although it can be tracked down, it can save you a bit of time having to do so.  A new clicker is available soon and this one will be replaced, called iclicker 2.  Good thing is that the battery life is long!",4.0
It was as described (used but had full batteries) and works well.,4.0
"Decent, but the Gen2 is much better. But it's simple, solid, and gets the job done.",4.0
"It was in good condion, it just had the rented sticker on it although I purchased the clicker, has wear and tear but I can tolerate it.",4.0
Works great. Used it for two semesters and original battery is still working. Only problem is the battery cover is very loose and always falls off.,4.0
"Works as well as the latest edition, just doesn't have number setting (only letters)",4.0
"It works great, I had a problem trying to register it, it said the code was invalid however it was not. My professor fixed it easily though, and I couldn't be happier.",4.0
"The plastic is peeling a little but no biggie, I bought a used item and expected it to have a few knicks and scratches. The biggest thing is that it works, and I tried it out today in class to verify that. Pretty easy to use, no directions needed. Hopefully it helps me throughout the various courses that instructors actually use it.",4.0
"Works as described and has great battery life. I don't think it's a necessary classroom tool, but many professors require it as a way to take attendance and to find out whether students understand the material being taught. I don't see any reason to buy it new rather than used (mine was used).",4.0
"As described, Fast shipment. thank you",4.0
Average condition.,4.0
"the appearance is in good condition, and turned on and off fine. It seems to be completely functional.",4.0
Easy transaction very cheap!,4.0
Very lightweight and batteries last forever!!,4.0
I bought this for a class I had for the semester. I had to place tissue in the battery compartment to hold the battery in place so my remote would work. Either than that it got me through the class.,4.0
"I was initially drawn to the i>clicker Android app because it meant one less thing I had to carry around with me. I needed it for a few classes since it was part of my participation grade.

Unfortunately, that app was godawful. I ended up getting the actual remote. It's pretty basic, so I find it hard to believe that it's really worth the price. The cost might simply be reflective of the fact that i>clicker basically have a monopoly on this sort of thing. Still, after registration, it worked. I got through my classes and it never failed me.

I am not letting the app color my review of the remote. The remote itself works great. It's just the price of the clicker that seems outlandish to me, but at least it has a fairly decent resale value, and to their credit, i>clicker makes that process very easy.

(3.5/5 stars)",4.0
It's just an ordinary iclicker. Nothing special but gets the job done and is cheaper than the iclicker two. I recommend it if you want to save some money.,4.0
"This product does its job. Don't get me wrong. But it's inevitable to press the on/off button because there's no cover for it. In result, you might be wasting your batteries in this iClicker without even realizing!!! Watch out.",4.0
amazing product will recommend it to more people at my college and friends who has to use this in the future,4.0
Apparently it was such a wonderful item that someone stole it out of my son's backpack within the first month of college.  Had to replace with a new one from the college bookstore - which was not at as good of a price!,4.0
"I hate the system and the fact it is sometimes required. Pay $40 for these things.

However, the product works very well, it's the system that's worthless.",4.0
I was pleased with the condition of the product and also the lack of waiting time for delivery. Product has worked well all semester for me with not problems.,4.0
"I was required to purchase this for a college course. I've never had an issue with signal dropping but I do have an issue with the price. Other than that, it's a great learning tool and a great way for my college professors to check and gauge students' understanding of the course material.",4.0
"For a review for something like this, I did not have a choice but to buy this item for a certain class...

But aside from that it works great, your teacher should specify the model his/her program is compatible with. This one worked with it.",4.0
"This was in good shape, easy to use, set up, and works fine. I wish I would have paid a little less but since I waited last minute, I got what I got it for.",4.0
"I had to have this for school and it was much cheaper here then in the school book store, works good.",4.0
"I would never order half of this stuff if it weren't for school, but I needed this and I have to say I'm quite pleased. It came super quickly and was well packaged. It works great.

Still don't want the stupid thing, but that's just not up to me :P",4.0
"The iclicker was still in good condition and came with working batteries, but the ID number in the back that is necessary for use in any classroom was missing and I had to go through quite a hassle to retrieve it. Other than that, the product came quickly and I'm happy with it.",4.0
I chose this rating because it was was like new. The iclicker was in very good condition although I wish it came with extra batteries.,4.0
"I received this product brand new, the box had not even been opened. It works well and had batteries included as stated.",4.0
The iClicker has worked perfectly so far. No problems thus far and I don't expect anything different in the future.,4.0
"I had to buy this iClicker for one of my classes and I saw that it was part of Amazon Prime 2 day shipping. I didn't care for the price considering at my bookstore it is almost twice as much. I gave this a 4 star because my 2 day shipping was NOT 2 day shipping! I was very unhappy with Amazon Prime. I was suppose to get it in on Saturday and instead it came Monday when I ordered it early Thursday. Very very very unhappy about the shipping!!! But the item itself is ok I guess. I don't like the iClicker compared to the other clickers, but since I had to buy it for a class... I suppose it will do. It does what it's suppose to do.",4.0
Nothing to complain about even though its used and was happy about my purchase and easy to use and register it for my class.,4.0
"This iClicker was in good condition and works very well. It came with batteries and shipped pretty quickly. It's less expensive than buying it anywhere else, and buying an iClicker 2 is pointless, they do the same thing.",4.0
I was really impressed with the fast service; the product was received within only a few days and before the class where it was needed.  The product was exactly how it was advertized.  Thank you.,4.0
"I needed this for a Biology class and have been happy with it.  The transaction went well, and the iClicker has been pretty straightforward to use and reliable.  I'm not sure anyone is really dying to own an iClicker, but, like me, must get one for a class or other activity.  All in all, it's not a bad little device.",4.0
"@ title.
The sticker was placed over the ID but I was lucky enough the sticker wasn't too sticky. I was able to peel the ID sticker and the USED sticker apart but the ID sticker ripped off of the back of the iclicker in the process :[

product received as advertised. -1 star for making it so darn frustrating to remove stickers. After peeling the stickers, sticky residue was left on the device... took forever to rub it off.",4.0
"This seller was helpful in getting the product to me. I am happy with what I got but more details should have been included. For example, whether batteries were included or not (they were) and just basic instructions for the item.",4.0
"No problems, worked all semester. Cheaply made so in my opinion expensive for what you get. But it was required for class and it did its job.",4.0
"Simple to use and set up. Since it uses a radio frequency there is no connectivity problems.
It makes student engage even more with the class and it helps them know if they are understanding the concept in real time. In addition for teachers and professors is a great tool, because, they can immediately know by the response if the class is following along are they need to recap the concept.
Besides, the iCliker makes the classroom so much more interactive and fun. Great little classroom tool.
The only reason for the 4 stars is price. For a remote control with only 6 buttons any price above $20 dollars is excessive.",4.0
"It works neatly. I bought it for my class. I wish it wasn't that expensive. If you want to buy one for your class, I suggest a used one.",4.0
This item showed up on time. It would in excellent condition. If it was for me I would have more to say about it. It was for my daughters chemistry class. I am sure it works fine or she would have told me.,4.0
Great tool for large classes. I think it is a great device to quickly test students on the topics being studied and to take attendance too. The instructions (I think) don't tell you that when you are being polled it is the last click you do that counts.,4.0
"Who knew a machine with 5 buttons would be this fun? When I first bought this I have to say I was very disappointed. It was plain, heavy, and quite boring to look at. But all of my preemptive judgment changed at a instant when I got to use it in class. This i>clicker made class participation a breeze, I was able to participate even when I am not feeling well enough to speak in class. Though it still looks quite boring outside of class but inside of class it became the most interesting thing to play with: Answering questions, taking surveys, and having your point of views be a part of the class, what cant this thing do?

Please pardon my grammar issues.",4.0
So there was no cover for the battery.  Did not realize it till I received the item and it was listed on the receipt as missing but I didn't notice anything telling me that it was missing when I ordered it. Probably my bad but definately would have picked another one for the same price had I knew.,4.0
Easy to handle and batteries were included! Not much else to say about the product except that it gets its job done.,4.0
"I've used these before and they're a bit easier in class than just raising your hand for an answer. My University uses them in a lot of their classes. I didn't want to buy it at school because it was cheaper here and I'm pretty sure they ran out because we're about to start the next term. The package arrived very quickly, but I am also using a Prime trial so that's probably why is got here so fast. Other than that there's really not much to say about it.",4.0
This particular model is a requirement for one of my son's college courses. He claims it is easy to use with good range.,4.0
"Product arrived very soon after ordering it, and was in nice condition.  The only issue was that it was hard to read the code on the back.",4.0
"I've never used an I>clicker before, so I can't give much of an opinion about it. One thing I found disappointing is that it was shipped in a bubble envelope instead of a box,so when I opened it I discovered that it had been on, using up the batteries for who knows how long? Devices that can easily be turned on and off by pressing a button ship better in a small box, rather than an envelope.",4.0
The shipment came as expected with no delays. It came in mint condition and works perfectly!,4.0
"This product is great and works very well. It arrived right on time. One problem though: the ID number on the back that you use to register the iClikcer online was wrong. I was able to figure it out, but it made it a little difficult. Otherwise, I'm very satisfied!!!",4.0
Very simple and straight forward to use. Wish quality was a tad better though.,4.0
"This is just what i wanted an expected.  I saw some reviews about the cover page phone dial being a decal, so I was prepared for that and have no issue with it.  I would buy again.",4.0
"Didn't realize the dial was just a sticker - I was expecting an actual little old-fashioned dial built into the cover or at least an image that blended better with the cover.  The sticker is high gloss, while the rest of the cover is matte, producing a strange contrast.  It still works fine as an address book though.  And considering the price, I shouldn't have expected so much, I guess, and it's still cute.",4.0
Nice size to fit in your purse or pocket. Lots of writing space without lines that restrict information. I gave only 4 stars because I would have liked a sturdier cover.,4.0
"i increased my stars from 1 to 3, because even though size mattered to me (a lot because the friend they were purchased for only wants cards she can put 4x6 pictures in), the cards are very pretty, i didn't give them to the friend they were originally purchased for.  hopefully they have corrected the size error on the page where you order them.

10/10/14 update: i'm now changing my review from 3 stars to 4, with the emphasis that the actual cards are less than 4x6, and the envelopes are also less than 4x6.  the dimensions of the cards should be stated clearly in the descriptions and not just the dimension of of the box they come in.  having said that, the box they come in being 6 inches should have told me that the cards would HAVE to be less than six inches.  i didn't notice that the height was almost an inch, which meant they were describing the box and not the cards in it.",4.0
"As the previous reviewer mentioned, these are very tiny notes!  The four smaller pads are the size of Post-Its that can really only be used as page markers or to write brief notes.  That being said, they are super cute and stick pretty well.  Great for francophiles!",4.0
"When it says ""mini"" they mean ""mini."" They're really small--cute, but you can't write a big reminder do yourself!",4.0
Great,4.0
"Very good with lots of cards to start. It doesn't have an entree or appetizer tab, just fruit/vegi or meat tab which is why I don't want to give it a 5 out of 5",4.0
Pretty and well made.,4.0
"This is a pretty box and is very sturdy.  The included cards are about the same thickness as regular recipe cards but larger.  They are also lined on both sides which is nice.  The only thing I don't like is  the way the divider cards have been labeled.  It would have been so much nicer if the label areas were blank so I could write in my own labels.  I'll cross out or cover the writing on about 1/2 the cards which will ""bug"" me every time I look for a recipe and will cause me, eventually, to purchase another box to use.  But then, most people may not be as anal as I am.  Overall, I would recommend this  product.",4.0
"Very cute for the price, perfect size. Already began using this the day it came. Love the different color tabs and the fact that they were prefilled out.",4.0
"Super cute! I am worried about getting something on the box as it's treated paper, and we all know how messy kitchens can be. Just adorable, though.",4.0
Was a present for a friend and she really liked it. Good quality.,4.0
very nice recipe holder,4.0
"This was a sturdy, thick box - not cheap at all.  Was a great gift for a new cook.",4.0
Smaller than expected but great for a cozy kitchen. The design is even cuter in person and the cards are lovely.,4.0
This recipe box was great in style and quality. For the price and amount of cards it comes with the product beats comparable items out there. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others.,4.0
Awesome box and cards. 4 stars because they tempted me though I have no use for them.,4.0
Bought this for a bridal shower for guests to write recipes for the bride.  The box is very cute and the recipe cards are perfect.  I like the layout of the recipe card and they are perfect for having different people write recipes as there is a line for who the recipe is from.  The category dividers that come with the box are also great and look very nice.,4.0
"I really like the set up of this binder, however, you honestly COULD make your own at home.  The organizing tabs and pockets are actually really nice though.  If I could change anything, I would personally make it a bit smaller.",4.0
"I am trying to save family recipes, and recipes of my own somewhere. I saw this, and thought it was perfect. I liked the design, and it came with its own recipe cards. I received it, and i like it even more in person. Regular flash cards fit in perfectly as well.",4.0
"I've had several of these over the years.  What I like about this one in particular is the size - I tend to print recipes off the computer, and this organizer handles the 9x12 page size very well.  I also like that the ingredients are listed on the right side of the page - makes it easier to make lists.  Also like the ""one recipe on one side, two recipes on the obverse"" pages - not all recipes need a whole page but sometimes they do.  Having the pockets on each section divider makes it easy to store ""possible"" for use at a later date.",4.0
"GOOD:
 - Beautifully done, inside and out
 - Dividers and pocket sections.
 - Standard (8 1/2 X 11) sizing with standard holes (easy to save recipes from your printer)

WISH IT HAD:
 - D-Ring type binder (easier to keep papers straight and tends to put less stress on the rings over time)
 - Clear plastic sleeves for recipe cards (so you can see both sides when cooking)

Overall a very nice looking binder; as nice as any I have.",4.0
"My husband and I typically print out recipes from websites. This is a nice way to organize them into a binder.  I agree with another reviewer it would be nice to come with labels from which to choose but disagree about the sheet protectors should be provided. Although I use them, it might raise cost, and then people might complain about not wanting them. The price is good at $20. You can always buy your own sheet protectors.  I do think the binder has typical categories, but would be nice to create your own.  The binder itself has wonderful prints. You will enjoy the prints if you like William Morris of course.  If you are not as familiar with his work, the prints are from pre 20th century decorative arts. They were in arts and crafts style houses.  Not everyone is a print person, but I think these are not too ""busy."" I agree with another reviewer that binder is bigger than expected, but unlike them I see it as a benefit.  It is easier to prop up and I can use standardized paper and sheet protectors. Good product for a good price.",4.0
"This William Morris design binder would make an excellent gift for a wedding shower, a house-warming party, a newly-adult child about to embark on independent living, or just for passing down family recipes.  It holds approximately 120 recipes in a loose-leaf binder with pocket dividers into which you can tuck index card-size recipes.  The binder contains pre-printed, two-sided recipe sheets for handwriting recipes, and it uses the pocketed dividers as tabs labeling the major kinds of dishes -- everything but appetizers.  The problem, of course, is that in today's high-tech society, we want to print or scan recipes, not go through the laborious process of writing them down by hand.  Because the William Morris exterior harkens back to Victorian days, it seems perfectly appropriate to hand-write everything -- it's just that the average contemporary cook is not likely to want to take the time.  I found myself printing recipes, punching holes in them, and inserting them into the binder.

Hand-written recipes are a dying art, and they make excellent gifts for anyone who appreciates that kind of old-fashioned effort.  For the serious cook, however, this binder will fill up fast, and the sections will seem inadequate.

-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4.0
"My wife has been collecting recipes since the day we got married...almost 44 years ago...and it is always an adventure when she starts looking for a specific recipe she knows is somewhere in her huge collection.  She has been reluctant to try organizing them in any way because of their sheer number, but now that I've ""volunteered"" to help her organize her Top 150, or so, recipes via this Recipe Binder, she's all for it.

The binder comes with dividers for eight specific categories of recipes:
Fruits and Vegetables
Breads & Pasta
Eggs & Dairy
Soups & Salads
Meats & Poultry
Fish & Seafood
Desserts, and
Beverages.

Each of the sections contains five sheets with pre-printed headers that offer enough space for at least 20 recipes of each type.  The pre-printed headers cover things like ingredients, preparation time, number of servings, and directions.  The back side of each page is specifically divided into space for two recipes and the front allows enough space for longer, more complicated, recipes that will not fit into the shorter amount of space.

The best thing about the binder dividers is that each of the eight category-pages includes a side pocket in which less-often used recipes of the type can be stashed for ready reference.  That is particularly helpful since recipes have to be entered onto the sheets by hand; I don't see an easy way to transfer a computer-typed recipe to the pages via a printer.

This is the only drawback I see to the binder format, and it is pretty much offset by the fact that the binder rings allow for a whole lot more pages than come with the book itself.  Printing recipes via a computer/printer and inserting the pages into the three-ring binder mean that several hundred recipes can be safely stored and kept available for quick reference.

Good product.",4.0
"This recipe binder combines good looks with organization. The recipe pages are nicely designed with a full page recipe on one side and two half-page recipes on the back. They are designed to cover ingredients, directions, prep times, and serving sizes. And they are freely downloadable so you can print more as needed - not bad!

The one thing I don't find useful is the tabbed dividers, which are labeled by food type - fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood, eggs and dairy, etc. I don't think of my recipes in this way, so I can't organize using this scheme. They do have pockets on them, which is pretty nice.

If all of this works fine for you, then this could be the perfect recipe organizer for you. It's easy enough to replace the tabs with blank dividers from any office supply store. In all I'd say if you like the design on this product and need a recipe organizer, then buy this product, and any shortcomings can be addressed cheaply and easily.",4.0
"A few years ago I organized my collection of recipes (handwritten, printouts, clippings, cards etc.) into binders.  Three binders.  My favorite is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homemade-Recipes-Tabbed-Recipe-Binder/dp/1605532975/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homemade Recipes Tabbed Recipe Binder</a>&nbsp;in the bigger size (it came in a small square size and a bigger 11.5 inch square size). All the larger recipe binders came with dividers and also with sheet protectors that would hold various sized recipes.  I supplemented these with lots of extra sheet protecors.  All those binders were 2.25 inches wide.

I expected this binder to be similar to the others but it is different.  Mainly, it is only 1.75 inches thick and it is not quite square, being 11 inches by 11.5.  It holds a lot less sheets.  Also, it provides stationery for printing recipes which I simply won't use.  Sheet protectors will work fine, you just will not fit as many in.

The binder and the section dividers which have pockets are very attractive.  I do wish the dividers were not pre-printers with section titles.  Their choice of titles is all wrong for me and I wish they were blank.

I give this 4 stars because it is well made and very attractive.  I have always loved Liberty Prints.  I will use this, just not exactly as designed.",4.0
The first thing I love about this recipe organizer is the stylish cover and classic look.  I have so many scraps of paper and misc recipe cards that I keep tucked into other recipe books and now I have a go-to book that holds these items with pocket dividers.  I also like the flexibility of being able to use a 3 hole punch to add in printed recipes or write in my own recipes on the pages provided.  I can't wait to pass along my book of beloved recipes to my children and their families.,4.0
"This recipe binder is beautifully colored and vintage looking in floral style on both the covers and the included pocketed recipe dividers (great for storing handwritten recipes from relatives). The binder is very sturdy as are the metal binder rings, which are easy to open and close, so you don't need to worry about the pages falling out. On the front inside cover there is a very helpful liquid and dry measurement conversion chart as well as a food equivalent chart - this is very handy and saves me from having to stop in the middle of cooking and looking up the conversions online. The back inside cover has a roasting temperature chart and a oven temperature chart, which I use less often but is also helpful.

As much as I love the binder itself and the vibrant and sturdy recipe dividers, I am disappointed with two things. One is that the prelabeled recipe dividers have categories that I don't use so I have recipes that don't fit under any of the given categories. For example, it has a Fruit and Vegetable and also a Beverages divider, but I won't use these. I wish these had been replaced with Appetizers and Casseroles/Slow Cooker categories. To remedy this issue, I have just whited out the categories I don't use on the divider tabs and written in ones that I do use. Unfortunately, this doesn't look too pretty on some of the dividers. I wish they'd have let you customize/write in your own categories instead.

 The other issue with this binder is the recipe sheets. They are very plain and look very cheap like a sheet of computer paper. They do allow you to fit 3 recipes each sheet between the front and back and it is nice that you can go to the website (galison.com) to reprint more sheets as needed, but the quality of these sheets doesn't match the quality of the binder. I plan on tossing these sheets out and getting more attractive and colorful 8.5 x 11"" recipe sheets.

But overall, this is a great recipe binder and organizer for all those treasured family recipes!",4.0
"A bit small, but very good",4.0
"Wow, I felt like a new bride when I opened this! (OK. Not exactly.) But what a great shower, wedding or housewarming idea: an attractive three-ring binder that contains pages for recipes, dividers with pockets, and handy measurement charts.

I transferred some of my favorite recipes to the pages, although others went right into the pockets because they were handwritten by now-deceased relatives and I didn't want to throw away my mementos.

So many of our stories are contained in what we eat: my family's lemon-cake pie recipe is not that hard to follow, resulting in a slightly tangy lemon custard resting on a flaky light layer of cake. Delicious! And it was served at the wedding reception of my great-grandparents in 1892. Or the even older Christmas steamed pudding recipe, which had to be re-constructed because the original cooks didn't write anything down. And every Valentine's day, I make strawberry-custard tarts for my husband, using a recipe my mom clipped from the Chicago Tribune in 1957.

This binder is a great way to preserve these heirloom recipes.

I would, though, add several extra blank pages. There are tabbed pages, but not enough. It would be helpful to include a few more of these so that categories like ""appetizers"" can be included.

I tweaked this product a bit by punching holes in sheets of construction paper to make extra sections.

Buy this for yourself or someone else: prepare to have fun, and work up an appetite!",4.0
"This recipe organizer consists of a sturdy 11 by 11  by 1 -inch three-ring binder with eight tab dividers denoting recipe categories such as ""desserts"" (each of which has a back pocket for loose papers). Within each section are five sheets of glossy paper that are preprinted with lines for writing out recipes by hand, one imagines in a perfect copperplate. You can print more sheets from the product listing on the publisher's website, on whatever quality of paper your home printer holds and, if it's a color printer, with pale green lines like the original pages (though my inkjet interpreted the color as blue). However, if you are an enthusiastic cook this notebook may not be thick enough to hold your entire collection. The cover of the binder, and the heavy paper composing the dividers, are each printed with a different William Morris textile or wallpaper pattern rendered in mint green, pale blue, peach, and pink. The inside covers of the binder are printed with charts for imperial to metric conversion of a few measurements, ""food equivalents"" such as how many tablespoons are in a stick of butter, a chart of roasting times for various meats, and a chart of oven temperature equivalents (although most recipes give you precise temperatures in degrees, rather than merely telling you to use a ""moderate"" or ""hot"" oven). If you have any basic cookbooks these charts will be redundant. This is a good wedding or birthday gift for any recipient who loves Victorian-ish decorating magazines that specialize in frilly pastels and an abundance of knickknacks, and imply their readers are constantly relaxing with delicate china cups of tea.",4.0
"I used these for a bridal shower. I had guests write a ""recipe for a happy marriage,"" I also had a few of our professors fill them out. I left in the blank ones for her to use as actual recipes.

"I got this box to organize my old family recipes and those loose recipes that we all get from co-workers and friends at random times in our lives.  It is a really good size for index cards and comes with quite a few cards for use right away.  I really don't care for their selection of filing categories. They are fine for those that base all their meals on the type of food: Dairy & Eggs. Meat & Poultry, Fruits & Veggies, etc., etc., etc... Yet other than desserts and Soups & Salads, they really don't let you have meal options, like: Appetizers, casseroles, main dishes, etc....  I know I am not the only one that does a Breakfast Casserole, does it go under Dairy & Eggs or under Breads & Cereals... I guess if they wanted to improve this product they could insert a few blank TAB cards so that us trouble makers can add our own categories.  But overall a solid product.",4.0

If you target shoot, then you do need this book to improve. It is ""The Dummies Guide to better archery"".

"The life of a stay-at-home mother, filled with laundry, dishes, finicky taste buds and too little adult interaction, can be an overwhelming one. It can also be a joyous time of laughter, pretend, sticky kisses and stolen moments. The trick is in choosing the joy over the mundane.

Cindy Sigler Dagnan pretty much summed it up when she said, ""All of us want to be there for our children--we just don't want to lose ourselves in the process."" With sections covering the supermom syndrome, time management, financial management, personal growth, spiritual growth, and marriage, she provides realistic goals and solutions to make the most of our years at home. She even finishes out her book with recipes that are kid-friendly, yet adult palatable.

It has been a long time since I've picked up a book on ""the life of a mom"" that has been so helpful and encouraging. There were chapters that made me want to pat myself on the back--Look! Something I have achieved!--and chapters that made me want to be a better person.

My biggest complaint is that I would be in the middle of a chapter and would feel inspired to put the book down to go forth and do. She gave me the inspiration to ""Relax in the rhythm that causes [me] to dance, not trudge, through life.""

I really enjoy looking at a new strip everyday.  I was happy when they went to color everyday a few years back.  I gave it 4 stars because they have gotten rid of the Sunday strips which is a real bummer.

You now pay the same price for 52 less pages.  Oh well.,4.0
"I have been purchasing the Peanuts Day-to-Day calendars for years and I have never come across a repeated strip.  Although Schulz passed away a decade ago he created 50-years of Peanuts cartoons, which means that there are enough daily strips to last lifetime.  Given the deplorable state of comic strips these days (seriously, who can stomach The Family Circus, Marmaduke, Dennis the Menace, Close to Home, Kathy, Hagar the Horrible...?) Schulz's Peanuts will remind you of a time when comic strips were clever rather than humorless dreck phoned in by a soulless machine.  I miss the days of Peanuts, Bloom County, Calvin and Hobbes, and The Far Side.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this calendar, you won't be disappointed.

[December 20 edit]  I am bumping my rating down by 1 star because after going through this calendar I made the startling discovery that LLC Andrews McMeel Publishing has eliminated the Sunday strips and instead has combined Saturday and Sunday into one day!  This means that for the same price we have been paying in previous years we are now getting 52 less cartoons and no Sunday strip.  For shame, LLC Andrews McMeel Publishing.",4.0
"I love snoopy and I love Peanuts.  The comics are great.  They are on the small side, so if you have any difficulty reading small print this may not be the calendar for you.  It is a desktop calendar that you tear off each day.  I have a hard time not reading ahead.",4.0
"I've been purchasing or receiving this desk-top day-to-day calendar for 7 years now.  The 2010 version keeps up the same standards as in the past.  This year, the pages are again in full color, the whole package, backing and pages are recyclable, if you're like me and just can't throw the pages out, the box again serves as a good storage box.

This year the publisher is including a 'Daily Extra!' on the back of each day's page.  I quickly looked (because I don't want to read any of the future days before their time!) and there was a mix of word games, quotes, dates in history, tips, sudoku puzzles and word searches.  I was somewhat disappointed to see none of the Daily Extra! material was Peanuts related, but that would have been my preference, not necessarily others choice.

The other thing I was surprised at was the price on Amazon of $24.00 where the U.S. price on the box is only $13.99 and today, being the day after Christmas, a lot of stores are selling 2010 calendars at 50% off.",4.0

"I just realized I've been using Dilbert Day-to-Day Calendars for at least 5 years.
The only calendar I might give it up for is one that doesn't exist: 'The Calvin and Hobbes Day-to-Day Calendar'.
But this one usually gets at least a chuckle out of me when I sit down to breakfast, and that's not a bad way to start the day.
My only complaint is that the back of the pages now have some puzzle or quiz or something; I don't know who thought of doing that, but it's totally unnecessary - Dilbert can stand on his own and doesn't need any little extras.
Besides, I often used to use the back of old pages to make notes to myself for the day, but now it's a drag because of that stuff being in the way, so I've had to switch to using the back of pages from the 'Zen Page-a-Day Calendar'.
It's a little late for this year, but check it out for next year - it's still a great way to get a daily dose of Dilbert!",4.0

However, in 2011 calendar, the bonus stuff and Sundays are removed! Sunday strips are special and 2011 calendar takes away the joy of them.

"I've been buying this page-a-day calendar for many, many years now.  A couple of years ago they switched from black and white to color.  A nice addition.

The 2011 version of the calendar not only does away with ""The Daily Extra"", but it condenses the weekend into one ""Sat/Sun"" 3-panel cartoon.  No longer do we get a Sunday 8-panel cartoon, which are often very funny.

5-stars for the Dilbert cartoons.
Minus one star for the cost-saving content cutbacks.

1. The Sunday comic strip has been removed. Instead, the Saturday strip now counts for both days.

2. The 2010 calendar had puzzles on the reverse of the calendar's pages, this one does not. Granted I never payed any attention to those puzzles, but the blank backs not seem lacking. I'm sure somebody must have enjoyed them.",4.0
"I have to say, after getting this calendar for the past decade or more, I was disappointed with the 2011 version. It's no longer 365 days, as Sat/Sun are now combined, so we are shorted 52 Sunday strips. Granted they were hard to read anyway. An improvement from 2010 is there is no more 'stuff' printed on the back of each page. This means each page can be reused for notes on the backside. Last year, only the Sunday pages could be used. Another problem I had with my particular copy of the calendar is the glue was not adhered. So, the cardboard binding would not hold the calendar. Rather than return it, I used a glue stick which will hopefully do the trick. Due to the glue issue and the lack of Sunday strips, I must give this only 4 stars this year.",4.0

"I think these will be useful for us but are smaller than I had expected.  I should have read the product description more closely so that's on me--they're just smaller than I was picturing.

The cards themselves are about 3 1/2 by 2 3/4 inches.  The letters are 1 1/4 by 2 inches and fairly narrow--the sandpaper is only about 1/4 inch wide.  They are made out of cardstock, but it's a heavy duty cardstock and feels fairly sturdy.  They're heavier than what you'd get on a playing card or a flashcard.  The quality is reasonable for the price.

At any rate, I think they are a good tactile tool for learning letters and phonics.  My son likes tracing the letters with his finger.  Today we played memory with the capital and lowercase letters.  I was also able to get a good crayon rubbing with them. Although they are smaller than I had thought they would be I think they will prove to be worth the purchase.  It's a good choice if you don't want to invest in the higher quality but more expensive Montessori style letters.",4.0

"Linda Dobson is well known in homeschooling circles.  She has written several books; she is invited to speak at homeschooling conferences; and she has been homeschooling her own children for years.  Most of the books she has written are very targeted at the homeschooling market.  The title of this book indicates the same trend, but the reality is this book is for any family who wants to help their children learn and understand more in their education.
Her first chapter does focus homeschooling, as she talks about some key factors between public schools and homeschooling.  She calls these the ""school mind"" and the ""education mind.""  The ""school mind"" is more concerned about preserving the public school system than in educating the students.  The ""education mind"" is focused on trying to help children learn.
The rest of the book is a wonderful collection of ideas on how to help children learn, from reading, to math, to character building, to other facets of a children's education.  This is a great resource for rainy days, for when a child is bored, or for when a student is struggling with a particular subject.

"I am reviewing the Mobile Fidelity cassette version but I did not see that option.  I should not be surprised as they likely only sold 10,000 or so in that version.  As you know, MFSL puts out only the best and the cassette version from them is CD quality and the transfer brings the music to life as only they can.  So about the album........I came of age just after the Beatles had broken up but my parents who were too old for the hippies but too young for Sinatra had a few Beatles albums always around in the house growing up.  I myself had a bit of a Beatles 'discovery' in the mid 1970's but at that point I tended to like their earlier stuff.  Frankly, as a child I was kind of freaked out by their beards and hippies in general scared me.

Later on I started to listen more to their later output on my own although like I said previously, my parents had this album around as well as MMT and Abbey Road and Hey Jude so I already knew the material.  I was doing some reading recently on Sgt. Pepper's and I did see a few reviews which tended to put the album in a negative light when contrasted to the hype that sometimes follows this album.  One review from the LA Times on the 20 year anniversary asked ""If you listened to this CD on the way to work, would you want to listen again on the way home""?  That is a quite silly argument to make that the album is overrated.  Who would want to watch 'The Godfather' or even 'Once Upon A Time in America' back to back?  That doesn't mean that those movies were not classics and game changers for the film industry.  A great work of art is usually a lot to digest at one time and is something that is experienced instead of listening to mindlessly over and over like some catchy (and disposable) Top 40 hit.

So yes, this record did in fact change the game of the music industry and I know that a lot of people blame it for the progressive Rock of the 1970's, I think that is a good thing for fans of music that is involved and has some substance.  I can prove my point to you regarding the greatness of 'Pepper's'.  Why would a album that has probably a good 2 or 3 'filler' songs be considered the best album of all time?  Because the rest of the album more than makes up for it that is why.  I really don't find a bad song on Side One and my favorite of the bunch is ""Fixing A Hole"".  That song has so much going for it with the great bass work of Mr. McCartney and the great and subtle guitar solo to the atmosphere that it paints in the listeners mind.  A pure Classic that is only really rivaled by the closer 'A Day in the Life', another song that creates a mood and atmosphere that really takes the listener away.  Yeah, I could go without the sitar stylings of George or the roosters of 'Good Morning, Good Morning' but the latter has some good rocking guitar work that sets up the climactic closer perfectly as it segues into the reprise of Sgt. Pepper's.

I can think of many albums with no filler songs or that might have a better cohesion of songs, but Sgt. Pepper's did it first, did it best, and sounded great at a time when production techniques were still in the dark ages.  Of course Sir George Martin deserves a lot of credit for this and also for the orchestration.  Did the Beatles change the music world with this album?  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.",4.0

"I was 15 when Sgt Pepper came out. Ever since, it's been my Number One. Best album of all time - certainly the Beatles' finest effort. As the years passed, each return to those legendary tracks brought new insights and deepened my appreciation of this monumental record.

Then, last week, I slid it into the slot in my car, after having played each of the Beatles' mono albums chronolically to that point. I was surprised at my muted experience. Sure, there were great songs; the album starts with a bang and keeps its momentum going from the Sgt Pepper theme through Ringo's best track ever, the swirling spaciness of Lucy, the taut, infectious groove of Getting Better, running into Paul's wonderfully unique Fixing a Hole.

Then the energy begins to sag slightly. She's Leaving Home, though very pretty, is a bit stilted lyrically - Fun is the one thing that money can't buy? I don't know about that... And Mr. Kite is an attractive novelty but somehow a bit superficial in its circus poster lyrics. (Some think Lennon clever; others call it lazy. I'm in the middle...)

What was once Side Two begins with the incomparable Within You Without You, George's finest hour with respect to his Indian music. But then it heads south with When I'm 64, which sounded cloyingly cute and dated, rather than nostalgic. I imagined that it was the first of the cute McCartney tunes that met with Lennon's disdain. (There would be others.) The group gets back on track with Rita, which moves and has a wit that still works. Lennon's Good Morning Good Morning struck me as a throwaway. Surely George's outtake Only a Northern Song, while modest at best, would have been a much improved choice. The Pepper refrain was great as ever, but A Day in the Life? I thought of Rolling Stone magazine's having chosen it as the best of all Beatle songs, hailing it as a major work and I imagined Lennon debunking the reverence and calling it for what it is: a clever melding of two incomplete ideas that really mean little and have no thematic connection. Yeah, the song is an enjoyable listen, but there's better Beatle material.

Like what? Well, let's go back to the previous album (Revolver) and its closer (Tomorrow Never Knows). Recorded in 1966, it still startles and burns, absolutely pure and brilliant. In fact, my Revolver experience was not hampered by any (perceived) duds. It still stands as an adventurous, enthusiastic record that reflects a band still feeling its synergy. By Pepper, it had already begun to morph into Paul & the Fabs.

Don't get me wrong. Sgt. Pepper is amply rewarding. Most of it still hits me as impressive, inventive, groundbreaking material. But it doesn't have the consistent integrity that I experience with other albums - even the much earlier and astounding A Hard Day's Night. So I'm taking it down one star. And again, if I were to mark the beginning of the disintegration of the Beatles, it would be with Sgt. Pepper.",4.0
"If you don't have the 2009 Mono CDs, I believe these 2014 Mono LPs (I also have Revolver and Help!) are better than the Mono CDs and recommend the Mono LPs over the CDs.  I believe this analog sound (especially the rolling quality of the bass) is better than the digital Mono of the CDs.  I have all the 2009 Stereo and Mono CDs and believe that there's value in having both, because of the different mixes on some songs.  Whether it's worth it or not to have both is really up to the individual.  I'm glad I bought this LP and do recommend it.",4.0

"This was a remaster version and it sounds great. A 180g LP and double fold cover. It also had a booklet inside and some cut out things that came out when they first released the album back in the 60's. This is not a mono version, the stereo mix is quite apparent, but I like the old stereo mixes.",4.0
"Oooh, so nice to hear the remastered version on this warm, 180 gram virgin vinyl product from 2012. From the very opening  sounds of the crowd, to that first pound of the kick drum and driving quarter note guitar riff starting off the beginning of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, I have been amazed at how solid and fat the engineers have made this 45 year old recording sound. It literally puts the old original American vinyl version into the ""almost thin sounding"" category. Notice, I didn't include the Japanese vinyl pressing. I have both, plus the 1980s and 1990s reprints, and I also have the MFSL 1-100 and MFQR 1-100 heavy weight vinyl versions put out by Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, not to mention the U.K. box set version. Gotta tell ya, the MFQR box set highly sought after product is still my favorite for the following reasons: It carries that warm, deep sound like the newest release here, but with the original mix and mastered sound - just on better vinyl and lacking the intense remastering treatment that the 2012 disc has.

But that's not all - just as I'm awaiting that crucial piano note lasting almost 45 seconds at the end of side 2 finishing off ""A Day In The Life"", it hits! That awesome climax to what many consider The Beatles' best, if not second best song they ever produced finally strikes. BAM! After all the previous 4 minutes of ""I read the news today, oh boy"" story telling and now THAT note. A perfect ending to a perfect album on perfect (as advertised on the sticker) 180 gram vinyl and....oh no....no...nooooo! 10 seconds into that piano note hold comes not one, but 3 huge clicks and scratch sounds! Say it ain't so, but it is. I replay it twice, three times, hoping that a piece of rogue dirt or vinyl piece will dislodge and float away on my needle providing me that bliss of the perfect ending to the perfect album...only to have my hopes dashed. That scratch is still there. But the funny thing is, it can't be seen on the disc - even with a microscope. Ah, a pressing smudge.

Well, well. Only $25 with minor disappointment. You can't expect perfection like the Japanese get on their pressings. But hey: the trail-off groove with that insane vocalizing is there to listen to without scratches ad nauseum. And at least the nice cover is almost as sturdy as my 1967 Capitol Records copy. Almost.

Now for the wait that we all share just to see if we can spend ANOTHER $200-300 on the mono set later this year. I...am...holding....my....breath........(cough!)",4.0
"I ordered this CD because years ago our oldest son had a record that he played.  There was one song  I especially liked:  Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I am 64.  I love that song.  When I searched the attic for the record, it was gone.  So you see I ordered the CD for the one song.  I have played the CD three times since receiving it yesterday.  It was great being able to get it.  Some of the other songs are nice, too.

"I am not the hard core Beatles fan, but I can see how this is way overdone in the remaster.  The stereo mixing sounds like what might have happened when they first discovered stereo, bouncing around all over the place for no good reason.  The vinyl is fantastic, clean and quiet as a mouse.  Great fidelity, too, its just that I hate the mix.  I will not buy any more from the set until they do it in mono",4.0
I must say my favorite 2 Beatles Albums are the Sgt Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour products. I have to say I was pumped to get Sgt Pepper on vinyl again. The pre-reviews were amazing. I did receive this vinyl and the package is beautiful. The package is high quality and awesome. The heavy weight vinyl was as advertised. It does sound great..but...and I say this as a vinyl fan...the vinyl pressing is extremely noisy. Sad to say...I prefer the last issue to this one... and dare I say the CD.,4.0
"The editorial description of the challenge of bringing Sgt Pepper into the 21st century shows the painstaking detail and care to one of the best albums of all time. Those who buy this will be euphoric in the results. All this time later, the smallest details come out with striking affect which were never heard before. The bonus additions of the cardboard cutouts and extras inserted into the bi-fold album jacket is a great addition. So why not five stars? As I thought, the biggest challenge to perfection was to accurately do ""Sgt Pepper's Inner Groove"" where a hidden track is imbedded into a groove closest to the record's label which is supposed to loop over and over. This was likely made before the days of the automatic needle return. EMI unfortunately has put the inner groove so close to the album's center that if the auto-return get activated, you'll never hear it. Not that the one revolution (Revolution #1?) is a necessity to appreciate the album, but you do miss out on the complete Sgt Pepper experience. Still, almost certainly a must buy.",4.0
"The bell bottoms were hideous, and so were the clogs with mini skirts we couldn't sit in. I would never ware those fashions again but the music is still good and the beatles were a part of everything.",4.0
"Do you really want to hear Sgt. Pepper?  Over the years you may have heard a lot of people---including all of the Beatles except Paul---say it wasn't that special, or have some kind of complaint about it.  I felt the same way;  for me there's a 7 minute ""gap"" in (waht was) side two, namely ""When I'm 64"" and the biggest bomb on the album ""Lovely Rita.""

Some of you know the story, but for those who don't, it was George Martin and Capitol Records that messed up Sgt. Pepper.  The Beatles began work on the album in December 1966.  Before Christmas Capitol came around insisting they have a Beatles single for Christmas.  At that time all they had in the can was ""Strawberry Fields,"" ""Penny Lane,"" and ""64.""  They should have told Capitol to screw off, but instead Martin dutifully gave them the ""Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields"" single.  In those days the Beatles didn't put singles on their albums.  American fans remember the sliced and diced American versions of the records---which did include the singles.  But in the case of Sgt. Pepper it was released in America as it was in Britain---without the single.  And so the album has a massive hole.

If you really want to hear Pepper the way it should have been arrange the album on your computer/cd player, etc.  so that ""64"" and ""Lovely Rita"" are out, and ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane"" ---- in that order, in their place.  Suddenly, you are now faced with perhaps the best Beatles album ever made.  You won't believe how the opening chords of ""Strawberry Fields"" sound AFTER ""Within You Without You"" goes out.  ""Penny Lane"" sounds fantastic after that, and ""Good Morning Good Morning"" sounds even better and more appropriate coming after ""Penny Lane.""  In fact it sounds like what it started out to be, an album about their childhood.  That's how I have my copy of Sgt. Pepper set up on my computer.  I never listen to it the other way anymore.

And of course you can leave in the offending songs if you like them, play with the running order, etc.  But Sgt. Pepper without ""Penny Lane"" and ""Strawberry Fields"" really is a day without the life.

"Sgt Pepper is a good album, but it's hardly the Beatles best.  I much prefer A Hard Day's Night, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Abbey Road and even the often criticized Let It Be.

That said, Sgt Pepper is probably the most important album of the rock era.  It announced that rock music could be whatever the artist decided.  There were no boundaries.  In the hands of a great band like the Beatles this was great.  The lack of boundaries for lesser bands was usually disastrous and led to a lot overblown nonsense.",4.0
"The Beatles were one of the best bands around back then and still are today. It's essential and most of the songs are good but it's extremely overrated. I'd pick Revolver or Abbey Road over this any day. It was very unique for the time, that's why it's more popular. Some people don't like The Beatles because they think they're overrated. Their music is popular for a reason and most of their music's good, even their most overrated. It's not the very best though, their music before Sgt. Pepper doesn't get as much attention. Rubber Soul and Revolver are amazing, those are five star albums. Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home, A Day In the Life, When I'm Sixty Four and Sgt. Pepper are the best and are great songs however Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and With A Little Help From My Friends are overrated in my opinion. After all this was one of the first albums in psychedelic rock and it popularized the genre but now it sounds outdated in parts. Revolver holds up with age much better.",4.0
"In order to take a trip down memory lane, when the Beatles were at their (drug-induced) prime, I bought Sgt Peppers. My college era. In retrospect, Abbey Road would have been a better choice ... better lyrics, more depth, greater maturity (stronger drugs!?). This album did not live up to my expectations or memories.",4.0
"I take my place as the curmudgeon. As a lifelong Beatles fan (can't believe I have loved this band since I was 5 -40 years later) I think that this is not the masterpiece it is touted as. In terms of production and sound-it does qualify as groundbreaking. The songs just don't hold up as well as the songs on Rubber Souls or Revolver or Meet the Beatles. Harrison's Within without You is melodically good, but reeks of his pretensions and is the most dated track on the record. When I'm Sixty-four hardly qualifies as Rock n' Roll-but is a solid tune never-the less. Good Morning-while rockin' is not that great as a song except for snippets like ""time for tea and meet the wife"" -a brilliant throw away Lennonism. Fixing a Hole is a lovely  tune, but not great as the others- Lucy, Day in the life, Mr.kite which are undeniably brilliant. The theme song, while full of Beatle energy and a great sing-along is not among their best either. Sonically woven together the album stands well as a through-piece. Taking the songs apart individually, not all of them hold up as well. I should note that if I were Roger McGuinn or someone, I would think Fixing a Hole was among the apex of my songwriting career, but McGuinn was not the songwriter that the Beatles were. Still, I love this record and Gettin Better all of the time still counts as some of the best backup singing the group ever did as an arrangement. There is a vibe to record that is unique -it probably stems from acid and them being able to finally relax together and be creative before they fell apart as the end of the touring machine left them to their own devices. What would have happened to them if they had modern sound systems at their disposal? Things may have turned out very differently...All in all a great, but flawed record.",4.0
"""Day in the Life"" was the perfect ending to a great album.  Why add a little ditty at the end with the remaster?  Sure maybe vinyl was a little confining, but didn't it's limitations allow the artist to choose the best and discard the rest?  There should be an option on a CD or DVD to have access to extra tracks, but not part of the original.  Maybe a ""hit play again to hear added tracks"" option.",4.0
"The main reason I got the Sgt. Pepper's album is because of the accolade that it's number uno on Rolling Stone's magazine of ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time,"" but I don't agree with them. It's a matter of opinion of course.

You have your slow catchy melody ""With A Little Help From My Friends,"" a song I first heard by Joe Cocker, you got the classic ""Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds,"" you got your optimistic ""Getting Better,"" you got the spectacular rhythm of ""Fixing a Hole,"" and the rest of the songs take you on a creative journey. Other catchy Catchy songs that I liked were the wonder of ""When I'm Sixty-Four,"" upbeat ""Lovely  Rita,"" the brilliant ""Good Morning, Good Morning,"" and the extraordinary last track.",4.0
"The judgment of critical history, and the opinion of most fans, is that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is The Beatles' best album. However there is a large minority opinion that would point to Abbey Road instead. I fall into the latter camp. The reason is that Abbey Road is a more consistent effort; while there is some amazing stuff on Sgt. Pepper, about a third of the songs are arguably not that great.

The album begins with ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" which sets the conceit for the project, i.e. that this is a recording of a concert by a fictional band and their lead singer Billy Shears. Though Sgt. Pepper is considered an early example of a concept album, once we're past the first two songs that idea is dropped and not really picked up again until the ""Reprise"" near the end. All the other songs really could have fitted onto any album, the ""concert"" idea is a bit of a stretch.

During the recording of Sgt. Pepper, The Beatles had recently stopped touring and decided to be only a studio band from then on. Paul McCartney came up with the idea, partly I think to kinda-sorta keep them in touch with their touring/live performance roots, to do a concept album that would be a ""live recording"" of a concert by a fictional band. After the first few songs however, John Lennon said, ""This is stupid, I don't want to do it anymore."" So they didn't.

Moving on past the intro, the only other song that continues on with the ""concert"" idea with dubbed-in crowd noises and such is ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" - a great song, in my opinion.

Then it's into ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"". There was a big whoop-de-doo when this song was released because of the idea that its title was a stealth drug reference to LSD. However John Lennon who primarily wrote the song says that's not true. I'm sure he'd admit it if it had been. This is the guy who had no problem copping to ""thousands"" of acid trips, so I don't think he was gonna lie about where this song came from. According to John, the idea came from a nursery school drawing his young son Julian brought home one day which was of a classmate and he'd drawn stars all around her. When John said, ""That's a great drawing, what it it?"" Julian answered, ""That's Lucy - in the sky with diamonds."" Now, if you're most people you'd go, ""Wow, cute comment."" If you're John Lennon you proceed on to write one of The Beatles' best songs, that even decades later is still wowing people.

""Getting Better"" is another winner. So far, so good.

Unfortunately ""Fixing a Hole"", ""She's Leaving Home"", and ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" are, to me anyway, boring. ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" was, according to John Lennon who also wrote it, inspired by an old circus poster he saw one day. That's where the ideas for the imagery, events and imaginary people in the song came from. In my opinion, in this song John is trying to pull off very much the same sort of psychedelic imagery and charming effect as with ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" much less successfully.

""Within You Without You"" and ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" are both nice. Not earth shaking, mind you, just nice.

I have a real soft spot for ""Lovely Rita"". I think it's one of The Beatles' best songs.

""Good Morning Good Morning"" is boring.

Then we have the ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)"" which ends the ""concert"". Fair enough.

I've always wondered why they put ""A Day In the Life"" after the end of the ""Reprise"". Really, if we accept the idea of the concert, that makes no sense. But there it is. I can only assume it's because following that final, magnificent piano chord that seems to go on FOREVER with anything else would have been sacrilege.

Structurally this is a very interesting song. It was co-written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The song has three verses, the first and last written by John, the middle section by Paul. John's portions of the song were inspired by contemporary events such as the death of a close friend (and heir to the Guinness fortune) in a car accident, or reading a newspaper article about the sad state of the streets and the number of potholes in Blackburn, a city in Lancashire, whereas McCartney's portion is reminiscent of his youth in which a commuter's uneventful morning routine (during which he does things McCartney had done when younger - smoking, riding the bus to school, attending classes) leads him to drift into a dream.

The first Lennon verse and the McCartney verse is separated by a 24-bar orchestral crescendo. When primary recording was done, there was still a missing 24-bar middle section. Paul McCartney wanted to fill it with an orchestral bridge. Originally he had wanted a 90-piece orchestra; when this proved impossible, what he got was a 40-piece orchestra, their section recorded multiple times, eventually four different recordings being overdubbed into a single, massive, incredibly lush crescendo. During initial recording - we're talking pre-orchestra here - George Martin's assistant Mal Evans' voice had counted out the 24 bars, and the counting ended with the sound of a ringing alarm clock triggered by Evans. This sound was incorporated it into the song, to brilliant effect, leading into the first line of McCartney's section, ""Woke up, got out of bed...""

Then after McCartney's comparatively reality-based middle section, we're back into more John Lennon dreamy weirdness for the final verse. Thus - to me, anyway - the effect is of a stream of consciousness from a person who is only casually hooked into reality. The song begins with a dream, then the dreamer wakes, however is not able to stay in reality even when awake. In short order, after the morning routine keeps him temporarily grounded, he can't maintain that and slips right back into a dream - only this time it's a waking dream. ""A Day In the Life"" is my favorite Beatles song - actually my single favorite song, period - a fine and worthy end to the album.

BTW, from Wikipedia, about that final piano chord:

""Following the final orchestral crescendo, the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history. Lennon, McCartney, Starr, and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on the Harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The final chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.""

So, my final assessment of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: four of its 13 songs, for me, miss the mark. The album starts and ends well, but it's a bit soft around the middle. Whereas Abbey Road is good all the way through. So when it comes to Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band versus Abbey Road as the best-ever Beatles album, put me down for Abbey Road.",4.0

"SPOILERS FOLLOW

I appreciate ""Sgt. Pepper"" as a landmark achievement in pop music.  At it's best, it does deserve to be mentioned as one of the best rock albums put together.  However, on balance, I take exception to the claim that it's the best Beatles album ever.  It's not quite as flexible as ""Rubber Soul""  or ""Abbey Road,"" both of which have more variance in their styles.  Admittedly, I appreciate the Beatles more for their high level of pop craftsmanship than for their Eastern-tinged songwriting.  Among my favorites on this disc are ""Getting Better,"" ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" and the extremely creative title track. ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" is reminiscent of Sinatra, of all people and is also a fine addition to the album.  This is a very good Beatles disc and is interesting as a solid conceptual album but in my opinion ""Abbey Road"" is the ultimate artistic masterwork of the Fab Four.",4.0
"Right off the bat, this less-than-five stars does not signal that I dislike this album. the Beatles are an excellent band, but, like most of their works, it is overrated. is it good? certainly. is it puffed up beyond relief? in my view, yes.
If you want a superb album, this should definetly be one you purchase. but don't expect as much as you've heard",4.0

Some people (me included) have stated they prefer the MONO version of this album.....but unless you are prepared to buy the COMPLETE REMASTERED CD SET in MONO  (which is pretty costly)...You better stick with this version.....as you won't find the mono version anywhere else.....until they decide to issue the MONO versions individually.

I would say....All in all...it's worth the investment.",4.0
"Sgt. Pepper's Lonelty Hearts Club Band [Remastered] is a very pleasurable album to listen to.  The remastering is absolutely wonderful.  I am still surprised by some of the instruments that I never noticed before have been brought up in the mixes thanks to cleaning.  Many of these ""lost"" instruments have always been there, but with as many tape reductions as the Beatles did on this album, we are lucky that the engineers spent so much time clearing this as well as they did.  Sonically the album is more powerful than ever.

From the opening strains of the ""orchestra"" tuning and warming up to the final creshendo of the E major chord (played by four people on different pianos), this album is a treat to one's ears.  For the time in 1967, this was earth shattering.

That said, there are a few songs that are not my personal favorites such as When I'm 64, Good Morning, and She's Leaving Home, but it is still a mighty fine album with Ringo's finest vocal performance EVER in With a Little Help From My Friends, one of the high lights of John's career - A Day in the Life, and a host of other songs that are quite pleasurable.  This album was ground breaking and now it's a sonic masterpiece with this remastering.  If we could do 1/2 stars to me it would be 4 1/2.  Recommended.",4.0
"I actually resisted buying any of the re-masters, having just about EV-ER-Y fomat available of EV-ER-Y track ""the boys"" ever recorded. But I finally caved in using this album as a lithmus test (so to speak). Given the ground-breaking and (at the time) revolutionary production techniques used to record it, my thought was, 'if this one sounds good, the others will surely stand up as well.'

So, does it?

Yeah...kinda.

The first thing that stands out is the care that went into getting the original mix just right while at tne same time enhancing the orignal masters (although I don't remember the original mix being in ""Beatle Stereo""), most notably, McCarney's bass and Ringo's drums...you can actually hear them now! The vocals are as if they're right in the room and Harrison's leads, although a tad thin at times, are more present than before as well.

But even after 40+ years of listening and memorizing, a remix can never be completely perfect. For example, there are off-moments in the mix of ""Within You Without You"" where the guitar solo is out of balance with the strings and tambouras (yet it comes striking back near the end). The horns on ""Good Morning Good Morning"" aren't as beefy as they once were and the reeds on ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" seem a tad muffled.

But where there are glitches, there are also moments that shine. ""She's Leaving Home"" has never sounded fuller and more lush, the opening track jumps out at you from the opening crowd sequence and Lennon's vocal on ""A Day In The Life"" is so in-your-face yet so innocent it's enough to make you cry. Not to mention the coup de grace - the most important single chord in the history of recorded music - the crashing final E Major chord at the end of the album; it's obvious that this one chord was treated with all the reverence it deserves as the monsterous clarity, intensity and finality of it is meticulously and majestically restored to signal the end to this vital piece of history.

Overall, a good job - not terrific, mind you - of restoring (arguably) the most important album in all of rock and roll. But this one's mainly for the audiophile purist. And even then, don't expect miracles.",4.0

"Just got my copy of the 2009 remastered version of SPLHCB and iTuned it to my hard disk where the earlier version of SPLHCB also resides (yes, I used the same settings re bit rate, 320kbps). I can't hear any difference from the earlier version, except that the remaster is indeed noticeably louder. The packaging is nice, but the reason I wanted the new CD is the hope that it would sound better. The computer-only minidocumentary was boring; maybe someday I'll play it all the way through but not today.

If anyone can point out any portion of any of the songs that is objectively better in the remastered version, please let us all know. Otherwise, I'll simply consider the remastered versions a marketing ploy and not worth spending my $$ on...

I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars as I can't see any reason to spend extra money for a second copy of the CD. However, if you don't yet own SPLHCB, then the remastered version is the one to buy; if nothing else, for the extra artwork and for the minidocumentary video.",4.0
"I love the Beatles. I love good audio. The thought of new and improved Beatles got me to purchase 3 remastered CDs (Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road) on the first day of release. After listening with my trusty Sennheiser HD580 headphones, what's the verdict?

Listening to the re-mastered CDs is like looking out a window that has just been cleaned. The view is the same, but it is sharper, with more detail. The SOUND is the same, but there is more attack and decay (the 'shape' of the beginning and end of sounds), especially on vocals and acoustic instruments.

The sound stage is more spacious. McCartney's bass work on 'Day in the Life' is more melodious. 'Lovely Rita' has even more little hidden sounds at the end. When Lennon says 'bye' at the beginning of the Sargent Pepper Reprise it is clearer.

So what's not to like? Nothing, really. It does not feel overproduced, compressed or 'sweetened'. It feels like the record the Beatles would have made with better audio equipment. It's not going to bowl you over. It's the same music. It just sounds better.

Some people have said that they cannot tell the difference between the two versions. I have a pretty good audio system, and the difference was noticeable, but not dramatic. If you have a lower end audio system the differences may not be worth the purchase price if you own the original CDs.

But if you don't own the CDs, for goodness sakes, the remastered version is better. And if you have a pretty good stereo, the difference is worth the price of admission.",4.0
"Having spent some time listening to the remastered CD of Sgt Pepper, I don't understand what all the fuss is about.

Don't get me wrong: Sgt Pepper is an ambitious and brilliant album which is as fresh today as it was when I pulled the shrink wrap off my vinyl copy in June 1967. In fact, I'm amazed at how attentive I still am listening to it. It's not my favorite album, but it's very, very close.

But I've compared the remastered CD to the 1987 CD carefully through a good system, both on speakers and headphones, and aside of the greater volume in the remastered CD, it doesn't sound any different to me than the earlier one. When I make the volume equal between the two, I can't tell which is which without looking.

Out of curiosity, I ripped the same three tracks from each copy to WAV format and looked at the wave forms in my PC's recording software (the title track, ""She's Leaving Home"" and ""Lovely Rita""). The difference in amplitude is striking (and it explains why the new one's bass seems louder in direct comparison) but aside of that, the wave forms look very similar. I've read that the stereo remasters were subjected to a little compression, but I don't hear any difference from that treatment.

I don't think anyone is pulling a fast one here, and I expect the EMI engineers worked dilligently to make the most of the music. But I have a feeling that modern technology and engineering skills can do only so much with 42-year-old recordings laid down and down-mixed repeatedly on four-track equipment.

To those who hear better sound, more power to you, but I hear nothing in the new CD that I don't hear in the old one. This is the reason I give the CD four stars instead of five. The album itself rates five, but while those who don't already have a copy of Sgt Pepper won't go wrong with this one, they also won't go wrong with the previous CD, unless they want the more authentic packaging.

(BTW, for some reason the stereo version of ""She's Leaving Home"" was produced at a slightly slower speed than the mono version. The result is that the song is about a quarter-tone flat and has a decidedly dreary sound, particularly in McCartney's voice. However, this is not a fault in the remastered CD; it's always been that way going back to the original LPs. I don't know why this was done, but the mono version puts the song in an entirely different light, and it should be sought out. If you don't have the dough for the mono box set, find someone who has the mono LP and give it a listen.)",4.0
The album is fantastic for sound quality and clarity.  However I was very disappointed to see not one of the song titles displayed on my JBL stereo in my `07 Camry Hybrid after the sticker on the outside of the album bragged about how they had taken extra steps for Ipod song labeling.  Granted it is not an Ipod player however other albums show the song names just fine.,4.0

"I come at this album from the perspective of being a musical child of the early 80s.  As my interest in pop and rock developed I revisited the music that my childhood, summertime babysitter used to play frequently and as a result I rediscovered the Beatles.  My review is based mainly on my own knowledge and love of music and my own impressions of this album.

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is an imaginative journey through moments of everyday life as well as other more bizarre and exotic places that may not be so far away.  Drug influenced, as I have read, I can see that this album has a more hallucingenic influence that the perhaps pot influenced ""Revolver"".

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - Great anthemic openning rocker with brass interlude; this song sets the stage for an album that will engage one's imagination as much as one's insights on being in the world with its meaning and meaninglessness.  The album cover helps to create the fantasy of this album's journey into another way of looking at the world.  The energy of this song coasts without loosing too much moment into the song which follows...

With A Little Help From My Friends - Ringo (aka Billy Shears) sings appreciatively about the difficulties of life and how he copes with them; the chorus suggests (but could now, perhaps, be understood psychologically rather than ""chemically"") a naive attitude (casual appreciation) toward drugs:

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.

The simple relaxed pace of this song seems to mesh with the ""steady on"" message of the lyrics which in turn seems to me to be deep wisdom of the most unpretentious kind.

Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - Psychedelic lyrical imagery reportedly derived in part from experimenation with psychidelics and an abrupt switch in time-signatures mix chaos with mystical beauty in this song.  From a flowering delicate sitar line to the great cosmic ""Ah!"" one can imagine gazing into the sky in mystical appreciation of the beauty of the world, this song is a marvelous trip!

Getting Better - This song seems like a great ""in recovery"" anthem; like ""Eleanor Rigby"" you get elegant pictures of various people who, in this case, are emerging from their anger issues.  Very open and honest words coming from people who you could learn to take back into your heart.

Fixing a hole - Trippy hippy song with an introverted attitude.  Less ""lazy"" than ""I'm Only Sleeping"" this song seems to be more about keeping the world's perpetual griping at bay, maintaining a positive mood by keeping the negative out.  The upbeat rhythm and piano and melacholy guitar reflect the sense of a balance of the work and discipline of maintaining a positive outlook in a potentially depressing world.

She's Leaving Home - A poignant look at the mismatch of doting parents and their child who has grown and suddenly flown the coup.  Strings bring in sentimentality while the lyrics gradually paint a bitter picture of the parents who would keep their grown up daughter too long.

Being For The Benefit of Mr Kite! - Set against Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds it seems that prior to psychedelics we had...the Circus!  This carnival ride of a song is as hypnotic and disturbing.  Not as surrealistic as Lucy in the Sky, I have to wonder whether ""Lucy-in-the-sky"" hasn't met Mr. Kite on one or two occasions!  I detected one or two vague meglomaniacal thoughts in the lyrics helping to secure a presence of insanity.  Perhaps, this is another drug-inspired song.

Within You Without You - Like ""Love you to"" from Revolver, this song has an authentic sounding Indian style (I'm no expert on this) from instruments to vocals.  Deep mystical lyrics also provide either an exotic tone or inspiration depending on the listener's familiarity with mystical teachings.  Strings come in to help build the song over a full five minutes.  Great Indian style improvisation in the middle of the song as well.

When I'm Sixty-Four - Humourous, fun song with woodwinds and piano that looks forward to the bliss of old age in love. Strong contrast with previous song in mood.

Lovely Rita - Catchy melodies, sweet harmonies contrast with the veiled leudness of the lyrical content which is finally made explicit in the panting and moaning that darkly end this song.  One of many examples of the Beatles ability to layer psychological complexity concisely into a short song.

Good Morning Good Morning - Slightly manic song about the emptiness of everyday busy-ness; its the Beatles prelude to Chicago's more serious ""Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is?"" horns included.  Ends in a moment of zoo-like chaos.

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) - Brief but rockin' reprise of the openning song which creates a frame around the album.  The song acts as a frame in the sense of art as well making this album more recognizable as a work of art if not a well-developed concept album.

A Day in the Life - This song feels like a microcosm of the whole album that precedes it.  Its lyrics reflect a profound distancing from the values of the world.  The song moves from the opening melody through a brief psychedelic transition to a new melodic passage and back again giving the song the feel of a miniature symphonic suite.  Three times the music approaches a cacophonous peak indicating either escape from the insanity of the world or the succombing to that same insanity.  Along with ""Within You Without You"" this song clocks in at over 5 minutes and because of this gives you a deeper experience of the Beatles great music.

(4 stars) This album, framed as it is in its opening fanfare, defines a space that is filled with a wonderful variety of musical landscapes and psychological experiences.  This album is another world which reflects our own and the songs both in their lyrics and music make that connection effectively.  This is rock 'n' roll as art.  For progressive rock music fans I recommend the entire album.  The best songs for a progressive rock collection would IMO be ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", ""Within You Without You"", ""A Day in the Life"".",4.0
"The good: Great-looking booklets and covers accompany each Beatles remastered title. The books look great, although the text is a bit skimpy. The sound also is great. It's the original mix of ""Sgt. Pepper,"" so purisits will love that fact (I do) while others who love ""Love"" and think the Beatles' music should be remixed and reimagined might beg to differ. I think we should simply have crystal-clear versions of what The Beatles wanted us to hear in the first place, and that is what these remasters give. There's a bit of compression on the stereo versions, but it doesn't seem to be overwhelming or cause ear fatigue. Paul's bass sounds really fantastic on ""Pepper"" and ""Abbey Road,"" especially.

The only down side to this campaign is the fact that each CD is housed in the cardboard sleeve of the tri-fold cover. You better put the actual CDs in jewel cases once you buy them, or they're going to get scratched, no matter how careful one might be.

"This album has been highly praised but does it deserve it? For the most part definitely but it is not the Beatles best album let alone the best album of all time. I'll say that it is definitely in the top ten though. So why is this album not all its cracked up to be? Well it is not very even. There are some great numbers paired with some blah numbers. There is also the issue that this record is a little Paul heavy. Lennon really only has four songs not counting A Day In the Life cause this one is more of a collaboration with McCartney but counting With A Little Help From My Friends; one Harrison song and the rest are McCartney.

You might ask yourself, ""If the album is not all that great then why is it so highly praise?"" Well mostly cause of historical reasons. The Beatles turned the underground sound and made it mainstream. This has happened only twice since Sgt. Pepper's with the Sex Pistols' Nevermind the Bullocks and Nirvana's Nevermind. Keep in mind that while the Beatles turned it mainstream they could have lost to the Beach Boys' Smile album. Now this record is a million times more experimental then Sgt. Pepper. In fact to the extend that it makes Sgt. Pepper sound like bubblegum pop. A Day In the Life can't hold a candle to Surf's Up

"When this album came out, there was nothing like it in the world that you could compare it to.  Everyone went bananas, including myself.  But, I still don't think it's their best.  Before you start flaming, I think I simply overdosed myself on this record.  I prefer ""Rubber Soul"" or ""Revolver"" or the ""White"" to SPLHCB, but it does stand out on it's own.  ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane"" were part of these sessions, as well, so it started the Beatles down a path that I really love.  I just burnt myself out.  BTW, if you find a copy of this album IN MONO, it's a far, far superior listening experience.  Back in 1967 (and before)  they spent most of their time mixing down to one monaural channel and the balancing tricks they had for mono were amazing.  How can you really get any separation on one track???  You can imagine the many hours that went into it.  Surprisingly, hardly any time was spent on stereo mixdown and that function was usually handed off to an engineer or some Abbey Road pee-on.  Get the mono version, if you can find it.

"Though groundbreaking and influential in many respects, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is far from the conceptual, free-flowing image it may project. In fact, it could be argued that the Beatles' eighth studio album is a bit choppy in spots, with little rhyme or reason in terms of subject and sound. Nonetheless, the band should be commended for its studio experimentation and range of diverse noises within each unique song. What started as a potentially gimmicky idea by Paul McCartney, in the eyes of his three band mates, ended up being a critically acclaimed and monumental release by an already larger-than-life band from the 1960s.

Paul's idea was to record music as the Beatles but release the new album under the band name Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Accompanying the slaved-over music -- which would take five months to perfect in the studio -- was a splashy album cover and bonus Beatles paraphernalia that was included with the record to satiate salivating Beatles fans, many of whom felt the band had become way too isolated for its own good by the time the Summer of Love rolled around in 1967.

The first three songs on ""Sgt. Pepper's"" are alone worth the price of admission, and at the start, it does indeed feel like a concept album. True to the album's intent, the enthusiastic title-track opener, sung with gusto by McCartney, feels like the beginning of something fresh, spunky and experimental. In some ways, it IS like listening to a band other than the Beatles. Far from being farcical, as some of the other Beatles may have feared, McCartney's infectiousness is contagious at the start. Interestingly, the following song, ""With a Little Help from My Friends,"" sung mournfully by Ringo Starr, is an entirely different entity; it stands as a perfect come-down, a warning that not all is bliss on the record.

The hazy atmosphere of drugs abounds on this album, starting with the eerie, isolated and high-pitched keyboard on ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."" Though the song eventually emerges into a tuneful sing-along, Lennon's equally filtered and unnatural voice and lyrics are in lock step with the trippy images he dreamily sings about. Though his contributions to ""Sgt. Pepper's"" were invaluable, Lennon was said to be drugged to the max during its creation, at times nearly catatonic in nature. By contrast, his cohort McCartney, though also partaking heavily in his share of ""downers,"" warmed up for numerous ""Sgt. Pepper's"" sessions with cocaine, paving the way for a remarkable contrast in moods, singing styles and attitudes throughout the record's journey.

Some of this stuff is pure Beatles pop, conventional and safe. ""Getting Better,"" for instance, was at one time featured in TV commercials (for a TV brand, I think). Though the lyrics on ""Getting Better"" are surprisingly introspective and frank (""I used to be cruel to my woman/I'd beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved""), the sound is upbeat, familiar and friendly. Elsewhere, McCartney is positively stately sounding on such gems as the beautiful ""She's Leaving Home,"" the upbeat ""Lovely Rita"" and the innocent-sounding ""When I'm Sixty-Four.""

A few laborious swerves on the record include Lennon's somewhat contrived-sounding ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" and George Harrison's droning, sitar-laced ""Within You Without You,"" which, to its credit, does include a pertinent message about the ultimate unimportance and mortality of humans. Though Harrison's tune strives for a never-ending deepness, a far more interesting and trippy time occurs on the epic Lennon/McCartney closer, ""A Day in the Life,"" which smoothly veers from Lennon's faraway annunciations (""I read the news today, oh boy"") to McCartney's snappy dialogue (""Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head).

Undoubtedly, from top to bottom, ""Sgt. Pepper's"" boasts innovative sounds from the Beatles that helped change the musical landscape. Trumpets and piano usurp Harrison's feisty guitar licks; Lennon shows up in a fog; Ringo obediently lends his hand; and much of the project has a movielike feel, thanks to McCartney's bountiful energy and producer George Martin's studio mastery.",4.0

"Influential and historical, no doubt about it.  However, I did not, nor do I now, feel this was the Beatle's best work.  It is perhaps the most unique album because of the time and the circumstances in which it was recorded. Very ""arty"" and polished.  Influenced countless bands in the seventies who perhaps even outdid the Beatles at their own game.  It is a decent album though, with some strong moments.  Lucy, Kite, and A Day are strong.  The rest of the songs are pleasant enough and you might find yourself humming some of them.  This is not a trivial album by any means even though there are better albums by the Beatles themselves and other artists. I do agree with some of the trashers out there that the Beatles were outdone by others, but I wouldn't go as far as calling them the Nsync of the sixties.  Some of our reviewers need a history lesson before they go spouting off.  The Beatles were NOT manufactured.  They were from working-class families, worked and toured for years in Germany and Great Britain before realising fame,and were a tight-knit dance band before they DEVELOPED *THEIR* composing ablilities. Nuff-said.",4.0

"Formed in the early 1960s and continuing for a little less than a decade, The Beatles were and remain arguably the single most popular and single most influential rock band of the modern era.  In 1967 the group released SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.  It exploded to the top of the music charts and remains their most widely-known title to this day, the answer the ""average"" person will give when asked to name a Beatles album. As such, it has a way of showing up in the top ten of critic's polls.

In 1967 the idea of a ""concept"" album was still fresh and new; the idea of mixing non-standard noise into songs to create music was very much an oddity; and the combination of baroque brass and electric guitar was very much out of the blue--not to mention the extremely eccletic way in which the band draws on everything from psychedelia to English musical hall.  It was startling, innovative stuff.  But there is sometimes a difference between ""the most innovative"" and ""the best""--and over the years SGT. PEPPER'S reputation has begun to fade.

The album opens with three knock-outs that remain as fresh today as they were in 1967: the opening ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" a memorable mixture; ""With A Little Help From My Friends,"" quite possibly the best cut from the recording and certainly the best of Ringo Starr's vocals; and the ultra-psychedelic ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.""  But thereafter the cuts become increasingly throw-away.  ""Getting Better"" is nice enough, but it's pretty much McCarthy in likeable ya-ya mode, no better nor worse than a dozen other similar songs.  ""Fixing A Hole"" is uninspired, and ""She's Leaving Home"" is an expertly written and performed mediocrity.

The line up reaches the bottom with two non-entities: ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" a carny-barker sales pitch without redeeming value, and ""Within You Without You,"" which might best be described as George Harrison at his most self-indulgent.  The band begins to crank up again with ""Lovely Rita""--perhaps not a stand out in terms of The Beatles' overall work, but charming, amusing, and memorable nonetheless.  ""Good Morning Good Morning"" is a sonic collage that either works or not, depending on your point of view--and then there is a rally with a reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and the plantive, distinctly disconcerting ""A Day In The Life.""

When all is said and done, SGT. PEPPER'S really is a sort of hit-and-miss affair, at its best remarkably fine, at its worst dismissable in an eye-rolling sort of way.  Much of the album's success was due to its timing: it was the perfect release for 1967.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been 1967 for quite a long time now, and too many of the cuts simply haven't held up well enough for the album to continue to be regarded as ""the best.""  Recommended, but it you're just beginning to explore The Beatles, this isn't really the place to start.

"In order to avoid simply repeating the accolades heaped upon Sgt. Pepper's, let me just say that they are well-deserved. Sgt. Pepper's certainly changed the direction of rock music, from popular music for youth to an art form for all time.

But to say that its influence continues today is a stretch. Sgt. Pepper's is the apex of 60s psychedelia, nothing more, nothing less. Today it's a quaint look back to a different time and place. A brilliant masterpiece that is merely fun to listen to once in a while. It's music and production has long been imitated, deconstructed, and worshiped beyond its true influential reach. Through no fault of it's own, Sgt. Pepper's is incapable of withstanding the test of time.

Do you need to hear Sgt. Papper's? Undoubtedly and repeatedly. If you have worn out your old vinyl and cut out the mustache and stuck it in your nose, do you need to now own the CD? Maybe not. You lived it and your only reason for owning the CD is pure nostalgia. If you have never owned Sgt. Pepper's in any form, you need to.",4.0
"I am the world's biggest Beatles fan (No, I don't own all the memorbilia.), I bought the CD when it was first released in 1987 and my parents came back from London in 1976 (The Queen's Diamond Jubilee) with a Parlephone copy of this album. This is the milestone conceptual baroque album of all time. It is a very sophisticated and mannered for a psychedelic rock album and a breakthrough artistically all the way around. However, it does seem that Paul and George Martin beginning take over more artistic control. That said, ""A Day in the Life"" is my favorite song of all time. IMO, Good Morning, good morning, Lovely Rita, Being for the Benefit... Lucy in the Sky are all great tunes. A great album...but did not stand the test of time like the White Album or Revolver or Rubber Soul. The greatest albums of all time.

"...and who'd think people would still be not only listening to, but also ardently talking about, what is considered the Beatles' masterpiece?  For the record, and speaking as someone who was obsessed with the Beatles all through his tortuous teenage years, I think the band's true masterpiece was either&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rubber-Soul/dp/B000002UAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rubber Soul</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolver-UK/dp/B000002UAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolver [UK</a>], and even though ""Sgt. Pepper's"" is in places somewhat dated, the darn thing still holds up remarkably well.  After giving it a spin just now (I hadn't for a long while), I can humbly report that it still sounds like nothing else out there, including its numberless imitators (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Their-Satanic-Majesties-Request/dp/B00006AW2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Their Satanic Majesties Request</a>, I'm looking at you!).

It's still worth noting the historical context, at least as far as the band was concerned.  The Beatles quit touring altogether in '66, and in effect became a somewhat loosly-knit arts ""collective.""  As more than a few biographers have noted, in the aftermath they basically went in seperate ways.  John became a hipster butterfly, dabbling in radical arts and politics (along the way running into a certain Japanese artist).  Paul looked to the past, immersing himself in the English music-hall traditions so beloved of his parents (and perhaps nostalgic for a time when fighting a war was still a noble effort?).  George studied Indian music and mysticism, learning more about the sitar and Hinduism.  Ringo painted his house.  So when they all reconvened at Abbey Road to record a new album, they all had different elements (not all of them pharmaceutical) to bring with them (incidentally, it was also around this time, in the same studio, that a somewhat more ""avant-garde"" band was recording&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Piper-at-the-Gates-of-Dawn/dp/B000002UA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</a>--some can see the influences running both ways)).  The resulting album, though not altogether revelatory, is still a great piece of popular music.

--The opening title overture, and indeed the overall conceptual nature of the album, was Paul's idea.  He wanted the Beatles to be re-invented, his first attempt for them to ""Get Back"" to the comradery of the past.  For, Paul, the present was all about the past, anyway.  George's acid-rock guitars on the opener was perhaps an attempt to drag things forward.

--""With a Little Help From My Friends"" is another of Paul's reveries, this time sung by Ringo (""The one and only Billy Shears..."") so no one is left out.

--""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" is the most dated moment on the album, even though it's brilliant in many ways.  John denied it was about LSD (please note the initials) but of course it couldn't have been written otherwise.  Even if it's not about a drawing of young Julian, today it oddly enough sounds a bit like a lullaby.

--""Getting Better"" is one of the last true Lennon/McCartney collaborations.  Paul the optimist sees a rosy future while John the cynic lightly mocks him (""...it can't get much worse..."").

--""Fixing a Hole"" was thought by moral scolds to be about heroin (it's not), but continues the Lennon/McCartney Yin/Yang to fine effect for a song about societal alienation that isn't just a product of it's time.

--""She's Leaving Home"" is Paul's dismal but poignant portrait of ""modern"" family life.  Both the parents and their runaway daughter are given equal emotional weight, even if the parents seem to make more sense (the girl leaves just so she can have fun?).

--""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" is another of John's lysergic fantasias, and it benefits from not being as over-analysed as ""Lucy.""  Many years later, the Elephant 6 collective (the Apples in Stereo, Neutral Milk Hotel) would use this song as a virtual template.

--""Within You Without You"" started off side two of the album (please consider buying the vinyl edition if you can) with George's full immersion into Indian music and thought.  It created the mercifully short lived genre of ""Raga Rock,"" but by itself it's one of the most different-sounding pieces on an album of distinctly-different songs. (Try to find a cover of this song by Sonic Youth if you can)

--""When I'm Sixty-Four"" was written when Paul was about 25.  Now he is indeed 64 (going on 65!) and going through a vicious divorce from a reality-TV star.  Irony, man, irony...

--""Lovely Rita"" is the weakest song on the album, ant it's not helped by the psychedelic freak-out towards the end.  I find it tolerable mainly because I heard it about a trillion times during my formative years.

--""Good Morning, Good Morning"" is an uncharacteristically upbeat tune from John with one of his strongest vocals and an energetic horn section to boot.

--The reprise of the title track brings the concept of the ""concept album"" full circle, and thus it's been imitated by most concept albums since then.  It's mainly notable for the way it leads directly into...

--""A Day In The Life""--perhaps the most over-analyzed song in rock history, it started out as two different song fragments from both John and Paul that just stuck together in a fit of inspiration.  One can only imagine the looks on the faces of the full orchestra when the lads (and producer George Martin) told them to ""just play anything...""  Yes, it is quite brilliant but I'm convinced that it was so by accident instead of grand design.

So there you have it.  I'm glad I went back to the album, even if I was mainly inspired to do so because of the big round number it has aged to as of this writing.  My musical tastes have grown exponentially since my teenage years, but I'm still surprised by how it's influenced how I hear other great albums.  This, however, is probably no accident, since ""Pepper"" has virtually fathered other great albums, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Aeroplane-Over-the-Sea/dp/B0000019PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</a>, which is actually even a bit better.

"Believe me,I'm by no meens a diehard Beatles fan(in fact I'm more into the Stones), but everyone should hear this album. If anyone is at all into or at least interested in the Beatles then they have heard this album. Is it important? YES! Is it good? LISTEN TO IT!",4.0
"Bob Dylan called this disc really over-produced,thinking that it was all very self indulgent - I tend to agree. And though Dylan at the time could crank out classics in a few days,the Beatles took their time and came up with the with the Summer of Loves` greatest album. With nothing but time,experimenting with drugs and having already left the road for good,the band set up shop at Abbey Road studios and first gave us the incredible double a-sided single Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane,then they dropped Sgt. Pepper. By the way,the day after this came out in the summer of 67,with at least two Beatles in the audience,Jimi Hendrix actually opened his London show with the title track.....and he nailed it.

Its true that drugs were being used by the band but looking at it today its really a non-issue....never had an artist had the complete freedom that the band experinced at this particular time. A mixed bag that captures many different styles and musical genres making it a little uneven but surely still a great disc.

Not every song is a homerun but there are monsters here....if your new to the Beatles there really isn`t a better place to start. A little dated perhaps but still an incredible effort by a band at the height of their powers.

As a very young child my favorite song here was always Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,my thinking was it sounded like a haunted circus...imagine my suprise when I learned that John Lennon had gotten the idea for the song from an old carnival poster from the late 1800`s that actually contained the first couple lines of the song. Wow.",4.0
"Lennon is tired, he only contributes 3 songs and Beatlemania has taken it's toll. Paul steps in and practically makes a solo album in all but name. He writes 70% of the songs, invents the concept, cover and plays most of the guitar in Georges absense. Paul deserves more credit for this.",4.0
"There are many different incarnations of Beatles.......even though the players always remained the same after 1962, the year they started recording.  There's the 1962 - 1964 Beatles, who made great catchy rock 'n' roll music AND great catchy pop music.  There's the 1965 - 1966 Beatles, who made ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"" sophisticated pop/rock, which is my personal favorite period.  The later Beatles of 1968 - 1969 (""White Album"" and ""Abbey Road"") were also great, because they were attempting to return to their roots, but were beginning to realize they were drifting apart as a band.....but still made great Lennon music, great McCartney music, and now great Harrison music.  The 1967 Beatles are a category all their own.  It was an experiment that went too far......and yet invented a new category of music,  progressive rock.  Bands like Pink Floyd, the Move, King Crimson, Moody Blues,  Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer all were HEAVILY INFLUENCED by the 1967 Beatles.  The 1967 Beatles was LSD Beatles who had the luxury of not having to play live anymore....so they could experiment in the studio with no deadlines, and no reason to worry about reproducing their sound on stage.  Sgt. Pepper was such a groundbreaker at the time because headphones were becoming a popular way to listen to albums, and albums were now becoming stereo, and the Beatles were starting to mix over-produced sounds with their music that sounded great in stereo while listening to it on headphones......especially when you were high.  But this CD just doesn't hold up in 2006 as well as it did when it came out.....a lot of people today don't get what all the fuss is about.  I think Magical Mystery Tour, released just 6 months after this, is as good as Sgt. Pepper.  And I think anybody who wants to listen to 1967 Beatles music (which was the real beginning of progressive rock, as I've mentioned) need to buy BOTH Sgt. Pepper AND Magical Mystery Tour......and burn their own CD, leaving off the weaker tracks.  Because the stronger tracks on both CDS still sound great to these ears.  Here's how'd I mix it:

GETTING BETTER

WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS

LUCY IN SKY WITH DIAMONDS

FIXING A HOLE

WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU

GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING  (use version off Anthology CD)

LOVELY RITA

I AM THE WALRUS

STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER

FOOL ON THE HILL

FLYING

BABY YOU'RE A RICH MAN

ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE

PENNY LANE

A DAY IN THE LIFE

"After reading several pages of reviews, I must admit that I also agree that this isn't necessarily the Beatles' best effort and that it may be somewhat over-rated.  That being said, it's still a great album.  It blows my mind when people say it's not as good as the music of today.  They need to realize that this is actually the starting point for the best music of today.

"Having read many reviews on this site for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, it's very obvious that any review that doesn't give this album credit for being one of the top 10 albums in history will get negative feedback from the vast majority. I guess objective comments don't count for much when reviewing this particular theme album, only favorable ones. Here goes, anyway. I love the Beatles with a passion. I have every single album they ever made, including compilation albums and even an old LP of the Beatles live in Germany in 1962 (recorded on an old hand-held reel-to-reel tape recorder and very grainy... but I LOVE it!). The Beatles were riding high in 1967 when Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was introduced to us. At the time, a theme album was a novel concept and very fresh, and The Beatles were given much-deserved kudos for having mastered a different sound. The Beatles could do no wrong in 1967, and this album is proof. I recall some of my friends talking about what a fantastic album it was, but I noticed they rarely ever listened to it unless they were high. Indeed, many of the songs on SPLHCB are psychedelic in nature and almost seem to cater to the less sober listeners among us. While I like this album immensely, I have to say that by today's standards, a fresh listen reveals many songs to be quite strange and others pretty ordinary. Again, I realize this review will be either panned by this crowd or else completely blown off, but as a true Beatles fan, this is my honest opinion. The first two songs are true classics. ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and ""With A Little Help From My Friends."" Beautiful! ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" is an ordinary song, IMHO, and not to sound blasphemous to other fans, but I truly thought Elton John's version was much better. This is one of the strange songs that the 'psychedelic' crowd seemed to embrace. ""Getting Better"" is a nice tune. I like it very much, and ""Fixing a Hole"" is above average. After this, though, the album becomes bogged down a bit by silly songs such as ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"", ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" (although the tune is quite catchy) and ""Good Morning, Good Morning"", as well as sappy tunes like ""She's Leaving Home"" (this one becomes a bit tedious halfway through it) and ""Within You, Without You"" (which I actually like, however not as much as those who call this one of the best Beatles songs ever. I like it despite the Eastern flavor. That sound just never did anything for me.) ""Lovely Rita"" is a definite keeper and the album winds itself up nicely with the 'heavier' version of ""SPLHCB"" and ""A Day in the Life"", two EXCELLENT songs. I guess my whole point is that, although I love this album, I feel it has gotten far too much credit for being among the best ever. Yes, it was very creative for it's time, but there are just too many ordinary songs mixed in with the legendary ones to maintain that status over the years. Some of the album almost seems to have been recorded for the benefit of listeners on LSD or something. So, go ahead, Beatles fans, use me as your new punching bag, just remember that I really am one of YOU! The fact is I like this album a LOT, I just think it's been a bit overrated. I give it four stars because 1) It was a very creative and novel concept in 1967, 2) it really is an excellent album, although far from perfect and 3) it's the BEATLES, for crying out loud! :-)) Peace.",4.0

"It's not that I don't like this album. Revolver is just better. The most interesting thing about this album is that Paul actually sings a song about himself in the first person and ends up (purposely) sounding like John. I'm referring, of course, to ""Fixing a Hole,"" and few people give him credit for being able to capture the essence of John's style. I think Paul was messing about to see just how far he could stretch himself as a songwriter.

Can you imagine John trying to imitate Paul as a songwriting exercise? I can't. Also, this album contains the best song to sample it's silence so that you can clean up the analog hiss off of the Beatles' albums. ""When I'm 64"" offers a section where the clarinets pause where you can get a nice long sample of Abbey Road hiss.",4.0
"Somewhat of a let down but, then not even the Beatles could top Revolver and Rubber Soul. Overall, the boys sound tired, unfocused and flat out high.

She's Leaving Home is just gorgeous. Lovely Rita is sexy. John Lennon's orgasm at the end would make Eminem blush. Who does not love the dramatic tempo changes of a Day in the Life? Within You and Without You is another one Harrison's Indian death songs that is almost as good as the two on Revolver.

The production of Peppers is what really sets this set apart. The crisp sound isolates the vocal tracks so that the harmonies sound better than the leads. However, the slick production cannot fix everything. The rhythm section of Ringo and Paul sound like they have yet to be introduced and there is just too much silly filler here to compete with their best albums.

Still there are many great memories contained here and perhaps one could give this classic an extra star for the Beatles visionary risk and nostalgia.",4.0
"I have been a lifelong Beatles fan and I have to say that this album is a very good one.  It is one of my favorites.  There are many good songs on it.

Each song is unique from the other ones, but very enjoyable.  It is a very good compilation to satisfy any Beatle craving.  It is a requirement in any good Beatles collection.

Starting off obviously is ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", a classic Beatles song.  ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" by Ringo Starr, ""Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds"", and ""Getting Better"" follow Sgt Pepper and are high quality songs.

""When I'm Sixty-Four"" and ""Lovely Rita"" are both really good songs, in the second half, and are some of my favorite Beatles ones.

As I said if you like the Beatles it's a must have in a collection.  It makes a great gift, and is one of my favorite Beatles cds.",4.0
"This was the first Beatles albums I ever brought & yes it just blew me away & although I have since got albums such as Revolver, The White Album, & Abbey Road which I admit are better efforts but no one can deny that Sgt Peppers is the best produced album of the 1960's, and one of the most clever & gutsy efforts of all time!!!

It also includes some of their best songs (Sgt Peppers, A little help from my friends, Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Gettin' Better, & When I'm sixty Four). Although there are some weaker efforts (Within you without you, Lovely Rita, & Good Morning) the album itself would scare the heck out of The Rolling Stones who in response would do (in a moment of madness) Her Majesty's Satanic Request, though they would return to form in Beggars Banquet!!!

To conclude if you want to hear an album that changed the way people thought about music & changed the face of the musical world then this is it. Sgt Peppers, yes the best produced album of its decade, the best music, ok maybe not, but at least it prooved that quality layers never quite made quality results, but Sgt Peppers is the nearest anyone has ever come!!!!",4.0

"The lionization of the Beatles as musical artists (no longer just head-shaking, ululating teen icons) that began with the string-quartet arrangement of ""Yesterday"" reached its absolute zenith with the June, 1967 release of this dramatically sheathed slab of plastic.

""WHY, THIS IS CAPITAL 'A' ART!"" people were writing.

The Beatles had gone and applied thematic unity, music concrete, the raga, societal commentary, really clever packaging and much, much more to their post-Dylan, post-Mersey worldview-with-a-backbeat.

Breathlessly it was whispered that the Fabs had used 24-Track recording equipment(!!) This record was such a studio product that No One would ever be able to play it on stage. (This was rumored to be the reason why the boys would never tour again. And, it was all about ACID and the HIPPIES. It was the biggest thing in pop music since, well since the Beatles themselves appeared in the US in 1964. It was the Beatles all over again!

The album followed on the heels of the ""Penny Lane / Strawberry Fields Forever"" single, a sonic statement which stood the pop music world on its collective ear. Early reports on Sgt Pepper were that it was ""even more psychedelic!"" NO! I CAN'T IMAGINE IT!

I was 16 and I drove down to EJ Korvette and bought the vinyl album to hear for myself.

It was actually, I thought, bigger than the Beatles. It opened worlds of thought and speculation previously inaccessible to me. It was enormous, contagious, dynamic, endless and it still is. The Fabs had time and dimension warped everything with this big black disk. You can't really reconstruct what that felt like at this far remove (2005).

Then I listened to the second record I purchased that day: ""Surrealistic Pillow"", by Jefferson Airplane. I knew something was going on, but I didn't know what it was, exactly. It was one of those days you never forget.",4.0
"... but the Beatles' 1967 masterpiece, ""Sgt. Pepper,"" is still an excellent addition to any collection. The album has been overhyped with the-greatest-album-ever cheerleading, but that honor goes to the Beatles self-titled double-album (""White Album"").

That being said, this one is too indulgent, with such lackluster pieces as McCartney's 'Fixing a Hole' and Lennon's 'Good Morning, Good Morning' thrown in with such classics as 'When I'm 64' and 'A Day in the Life.' Also, this album was meant to be heard as a whole, and until it's reissued with ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane,"" it's not a whole.

"This album obviously deserves 5 stars.  While not quite as good as Revolver or Rubber Soul, it is still one of the best Beatles albums and nothing short of a masterpiece.  The reason i give this 4 stars instead of 5 isn't even the Beatles' fault, it's the fault of every musically-ignorant critic or fan that has called this the first and/or greatest concept album.  First of all, there is barely enough cohesion within this album to even classify it as conceptual, only 1 song in 2 parts even suggests the concept of an alter-ego band writing and playing all of the songs therein.  And even if this to be considered a concept album, it cannot be considered the first of its kind.  Paul McCartney, who played the biggest role in the creation of Sgt. Pepper's, claimed that he was in fact inspired by Freak Out! by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention to do so.  This album was released a full year before Sgt. Pepper's and has a much more tangible concept.  Lastly, there is no way that this is the greatest concept album of all time.  There are at least 2 Mothers of Invention albums, 4 Pink Floyd albums, 2 Jethro Tull albums, and 2 Who albums that are better concept albums, even if they are not better albums in general.  All in all, a phenomenal, groundbreaking album that has fallen victim to some repulsive misinterpretation.",4.0
"Due to my age I was never able to exeprience this record upon its initial release, and thus I can only attempt to appreciate the level of psychadelic awe in which this surely produced in the first wave of listeners. For those in the mainstream who had no knowledge of avant garde music this must have surely sounded like a musical gift from a strange and distant dimension, and I presume that changed many listeners' perception of reality and art.",4.0
"This is an important cd to own but it is not the best of them let alone of all time. There are great songs on this album like She's leaving home, When i'm 64, For the Benfit of Mr. kite, lovlely rita, and of course there best song to me a day in the life for these songs alone it is a must have. But there is bad songs on here like the title song both of versions, lucy in the sky with diamonds which is so anoying to me. The other songs are listenable but nothing to rave about.",4.0
"If we're bickering over best album of all time, I'd go with the White Album.  And in terms of groundbreaking Beatles' albums, I'd pick Revolver before SP.

When I first bought SP, I listened to it hundreds of times.  But not much after that.

Originality, and being the so-called first concept album may be cool, but listenability is what counts.  How much dust will it gather after a few months?...

If you're into the Beatles, and don't have SP, buy it.  Play it a few times...Then keep it in your collection in case you need to throw a 60s theme party.

"This album took pop music in a new direction and is one of my favorites.""A Day In The Life"", makes the album. And ""Its Getting Better"" is almost a perfect pop song.

"I LOVE BOTH RECORDS, DON'T GET ME WRONG. BUT SGT P.

CLOSE THOUGH. SGT P. WOULD HIT THAT 5 STAR STATUS FOR ME IF AMMENDED. DROP ""WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU"" & ""WHEN I'M SIXTY FOUR"". THEY'D MAKE A NICE 45. ""W Y W Y"" IS JUST A DATED EXPERIMENT AND ""W I 64"" IS AN EXCELLENT SONG IN THE COLE PORTER/POP TRADITION. THE PROBLEM, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, WITH THOSE SONGS IS THAT THEY DON'T ADD TO THE RECORD. AN AWESOME ADDITION MIGHT BE ""STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER"" & ""PENNY LANE"". WHY NOT? THEY WERE RECORDED DURING THE SGT P. SESSIONS. I THINK WE'D ALL AGREE THAT THEY ARE SONGS WORTH LISTENING TO A MILLION TIMES-KILLER SONGS AND INTRICATE STUDIO PIECES THAT MATCH THE MAGIC OF THE REST OF SGT P.

"I would like to say that this album is spectacular and has some wonderful songs and can probably be considered the first SUCCESSFUL concept album. I would just like to point to out that at the time The Beatles were working in the studio on this album, Abbey Lane Studios had the originator's of the concept album and the king's of progressive rock in the recording booth over. That band is of course Pink Floyd and at the time, they were most likely recording there debut album on a big label, Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Seeing as the Floyd were about the most psychedelic thing around at the time and that this is right when the Beatles music started to get downright loopy, I'm guessing the friendly bandmates at one time presented The Beatles with the idea of a concept album. I didn't mean to steal any thunder, this is an excellent album and a wise choice to buy. However, when people say it's the best of all time, it scares me. As great as it is, I'd recommend getting Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO), The Wall by Pink Floy, or why not even Rumours by Fleetwood Mac before buying Sgt. Pepper. If you are a beginning listner of the band, I would reccomend buying The Beatles 1 before buying this. It might be a little too trippy for the beginner and it might turn you off to the Beatles, why not buy what they are best known for?",4.0
"like what chuck said this cd is not the best cd ever. First of all it isn't even the best BEATLE cd ever(revolver)which did not influence people more but was still better and more innovative. however just because most of their talent was in writing easy yet incredinbly catchy tunes that does not make them any less ""good"".I have to say that i didn't know it was posible for 4 people to make a song with a FIVE MINUTE fade out(hey jude). Paul also was a VERY good bass and george (i am too lazy to type their last names)was also a good(still very good compared to john) guitar player(john and ringo just sucked...)anyway if you really want the best cd i suggest you read on this site about these cds...in this order)buy this cd since it is still a great one to hear

HELLO!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE WHOLE DAMN ALBUM IS ABOUT DRUGS!",4.0
"amid the sun-soaked splendour of sequins, buffoonery and studio chicanery something was wrong in the state of the beatles. this is a Christmas Cake of an album with a slightly sickly centre.

this is paul's album. he is the wizard. anyone wishing to dismiss him as a contrite twee has-been should think again. on the basis of this album alone, paul need never to have proved himself in any way, shape or form again. this is a glorious lovesong to english culture, to the musical elite on both sides of the atlantic and to the sheer bliss of creating and playing music in a studio free to give you whatever it can.

and it shines! the chiming peels of the opening chords of 'Getting Better' to the frenetic drumming on Sgnt Pepper's (reprise)  bring us an album overflowing with optimism and bouncy poppy exuberance.

beneath this slightly conceited appearance however lies a pool of drug misuse and futility.  lennon, though at his peak, was overdrugged on lsd much of the time and was losing his grip a little.  lucy in the sky with diamonds is a wonderful alice in wonderland style jaunt through a cotswoldian wilderness but it gives in to an easy chorus heavy on reverb and a (by the beatles standards) oversimple chord arrangement.

harrison, bored with all this psychedelia adds cheery guitar and vocals throughout and a great song - perhaps one of the best on the album - and in subject matter ahead of the others in the band.

but where john and paul work well is in the segueing of the album and the songs 'with a little help...' . 'getting better' , 'she's leaving home' and 'a day in the life' - all effortlessly stoned (well, perhaps not she's leaving home) and bewidered and happy at the same time - what a glorious mix.

musically, the drums and bass are awesome. macca's bass woos in a motown sub-section beneath a byrds and beatlesque harmony and the whole effect of the album is of a giant pastel fruit landing merrily in a dreary world coming alive and screaming 'Wake up and smell the psychedelic coffee'

so a good album and one often overhyped with age - not as good as revolver perhaps - it runs out of steam just over half way through with good morning good morning - but well worth a listen really.",4.0
"I don't have to tell you, you should already know, it's like one of the most influential albums of all time, probably the most influential in the last 50 or so years. Actually it is often touted as the best album of all time, or at least there abouts. So there might be some disappointment with some people given the best album ever tag, or something along those lines.

Basically the Beatles created a new sound, they used technology to try and achieve some colourful guitar sounds, they used interesting instruments such as organs and trumpets and wrote some fantastical lyrics, and some lyrics about a cultural revolution, I suppose (She's Leaving Home).

The album begins with the title track, I don't really like it, I think after a few listens the novelty wears off, but most people seem to like it... Then there 'With a little help from my friends', which cuts out a nice groove, and is a memorable song to this day, and Joe Cocker does a nice job of it too. Then comes the best song on the record in my opinion, 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds'. There's harpsichords (well sounds like it), sitars, organs and colourful guitar effects, and fantasy lyrics, and catchy chorus. This song is one of the best songs of all time. So inspiring, so original, so enjoyable to listen to. Trouble is, they have kind of set the bar for what you can expect for the rest of the album, but don't really deliver. I'm going to stick up for 'Getting better', a classic piece of rock n roll, great guitar tone. The ballad 'She's leaving home' is heart-wrenching and is very intelligent too. The Indian inspired 'Within You Without You' rewards a patient listener, but 'For the benefit of Mr. Kite', behind all the glitz is a weak song. Of course, there's that classic piece of English Vaudeville 'When I'm 64', everyone knows that one. The other masterpiece is 'A day in the life', with it's big orchestra bursts and good melody and is a very interesting piece, though I don't personally like it. I'm increasingly liking 'Lovely Rita' more and more, the backing vocal chants are really psychedelic, and it's a fun song.

I don't know if this is the best album of all time or not, but compared with the best songs on this album, which includes 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds', some of the other songs aren't really as good. But I'll give 'Sgt. Pepper' this, it's a fun, enjoyable album, from beginning to end, it's entertaining and it's very influential, so what more could you ask?",4.0
"As I write this review I'm listening to this album and wondering why it always scores so damn high on the best albums list and I realize it's not the fact that it was so good, it's the fact that it WAS made and could BE made. Nothing like it had really been done before. But an album like this presents a problem: the highs are high and the lows are looooo[...]

 Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (8/10) This really isn't much of a song as it is an introduction, but I love how it gives off the ""live"" feel. very upbeat like most opening songs on their albums.

 With A Little Help From My Friends (7/10) A good little sing-along tune, nothing revolutionary,and Ringo sings. but it's still a classic.

 Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds (8/10) One of Johns more psychadelic songs. Great imagery throughout the lyrics, but his voice is too high throughout most of it.

 Getting Better (7/10) An optimistic little song. I can get into it and I like the defiant lyrics, But really not a highlight of the album.

 Fixing A Hole (5/10)I've never liked this song at all,it's a typical bad Paul song. Alot of the songs after this one seem to be throwaways.

 She's Leaving Home (6/10) Doesn't have that special something that most Beatle love songs have. The lyrics are alright, but they could have been set to the music better.

 Being For The Benifit of Mr. Kite (9/10) I think They did a great job of catching the whole circus atmosphere in this one. I love this song for it's fun lyrics also.

 Within You, Without You (6/10) I love the fact that The Beatles often incorporated Indian music into their recordings, but this isn't one of their best outings in that field.

 When I'm Sixty Four (9/10) I LOVE this song, I don't know why but I do.

 Lovely Rita (4/10) I hate this song! It has annoying melodies at the beggining and it sounds so friggin' pretentious.

 Good Morning, Good Morning. (2/10) My least favorite Beatles song next to Blue Jay Way. Have a listen and you'll know why.

 Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (9/10) even better than the one at the beggining, has a faster tempo and sounds better. (""Were Sgt. Peppers one and only Lonely hearts Club Band!)

 A Day in The Life (10/10) A lot of people consider this song a masterpeice, while I wouldn't be quick to do that I do think it is the best song on the album, I love how paul's part fit's in so well although it is totally different.

 Anyway, you shuld probably pick this one up considering that bad Beatles songs are often better than some bands BEST songs, so if you want something different be sure to grab it.",4.0
"This is the most overrated album of all time.  It's one of those things that has such massive hype surrounding it that people only say it's the best because they've been told to say so, and have been told so so often they believe it's true, because no one ever questions it, and anyone who speaks up on the matter is shot down angrily.  This isn't even the best Beatles' album out there; 'Revolver,' 'Abbey Road,' and the White Album are all better than this dated overrated overhyped project.  When Paul talks about this in interviews, he does not come across as humble.  Earth to Paul:  A band giving a concert is not an original concept, or even a concept at all.  Only three of the thirteen songs even relate to the alleged ""concept.""  And there were concept albums before this, they just weren't called concept albums or thought of as such.
The songs for the most part are enjoyable ditties, if dated, but they're not the greatest songs The Beatles ever did.  Only ""A Day in the Life"" qualifies as a classic; ""Lucy"" comes pretty close too.  ""She's Leaving Home"" is very pretty, but not what I'd consider one of the songs in their classic canon.  ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" is popular too, but again, it's not one of the songs most people would give as their greatest 20, 25, or however many they want to put in the top echelons of their catalogue.  All of the instruments, layers, double-tracked vocals, overdubs, and sounds do nothing but to put layers of gold on top of dreck.  And everyone knows deep down that the dreck is still there.  More layers does not equal more quality.  And I love ""Within You Without You,"" though apparently a lot of people hate it, but it's safe to say that most non-Indian songs with Indian instruments in them were recorded in the late Sixties and early Seventies.  It dates it right off the bat.
Of course, the hype surrounding this album is impossible to get away from.  People will still automatically put it at the top of ""the greatest albums ever"" lists or spew empty hype about it being the best ever, without having taken time to really evaluate it.  There are other concept albums, true concept albums, from this period in time, which have aged well and don't stand out like hideously dated bloated jokes.  Don't let the classic cover disguise the fact that there's nothing but an empty shell beneath the fancy exterior.",4.0
"You've gotta hand it to the Beatles: They were never willing to let the music get old. Nothing they ever did, either here or on other albums, was repetative or unoriginal.
  Sgt Pepper's reflects that perfectly. On this record alone, the Beatles dabble in phsycadelia, Indian Sitar, String-laced ballads, vochalized LSD trips, and straight up rock.
  The album kicks off with Paul's upbeat rocker/ title track, followed by the slower, tuneful ballad ""With a little help from my friends."" My favorite track ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds,"" is next. It's John Lenon's magnum opus, a brilliant sonic texture loaded with eerie guitars, lofty fuzz bass, and fantastic lyrics tinged with LSD imigary (""Picture yourself on a boat on a river, with tangarine trees, and marmalade skys/ Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, a girl with kalaidascope eyes..."").
  After that comes ""Getting better,"" a rather by-the-numbers rocker which offers nothing special, though it is an entertaining listen. I rather like ""Fixing a hole,"" a slower, percussian driven song with clever words and a great tune. ""She's leaving home,"" is a sad and moving ballad, driven by George's Sitar and tragic violen in the background, along with poetic narrative lyrics, all of which build up to a magestic chorus.
  ""Being for the benifit of Mr. Kite!"" is the reason this album only gets four stars. It's far, far, FAR too gimmicky, with irritating carnival themed lyrics, monotonous drummings, and boring phsycdelic interludes.
  ""Within you without you,"" is another Harrison-drivin sitar ballad which is also quite good, and more spirited than ""She's leaving home."" After that comes ""When I'm sixty-four,"" ""Lovely Rita,"" and ""Good morning, Good morning,"" all of which are essentially filler, forgettable despite their merits.
  Which leads us to the reprise of the title track, fueled by Ringo's energetic drumming. Otherwise, the song is a shorter version of its counterpart, and not terribly interesting.
  And all of that builds up to the album's amazing climax, the epic ballad ""A day in the life,"" a wonderful, poetic, dreamy, and shocking tune that sums up not only the whole record, but the brilliance of the Beatles as well.
  All in all, Sgt. Pepper's lonely Hearts club band is definatley worth the money to buy it, and it definatley belongs in your collection. It is not however, the best of the Beatles' albums. (See: Revolver, Rubber Soul, Abby Road.)",4.0
"I suppose Rolling Stone can't admit that Sgt. Pepper is less than stellar some 35 years after its debut (after all, the magazine is as old as the album), but when I saw it listed as the BEST album of all time, I couldn't take it anymore. Truth be told, I wonder who in the hell keeps perpetuating this myth that Sgt. Pepper is the Beatles' best. I could easily think of albums much better, either by the Beatles themselves (Revolver, Abbey Road, and the White Album, in that order) or others (Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys, ""The Velvet Underground and Nico"", Joy Division's ""Closer"", etc). Face the facts, folks: Sgt. Pepper is a product of its time, and one that hasn't hold out well. Granted, there are psychedelic relics that hold up less well than Pepper, but none of them have ever been mistaken for ""the BEST album ever"". I have each of the Beatles' albums, I am not one of these ""Beatles #1"" fans (owning only a copy of the ""best of"" that came out a few years ago, to line Messers. McCartney and Jackson's pockets), I know what I'm talking about when I say that (while this is a good album in its own right) it's not the BEST album ever.
I must confess, I got this album free on CD after having it on tape for years beforehand, so I can't complain about ""wasting my money"" even if I hated it (see my ""Let it Be...Naked"" review). But as good as this album is (and I can't stress this enough) it is not the BEST album ever...that honor belongs to Revolver.

"This album always has and always will be overrated.  People over analyze the beatles.  There are some classic compositions in the form of Lucy In The Sky Of Diamonds, A Day In The Life, She's Leaving Home, and Fixing A Whole.  The rest of the album is rather lightweight and comparatively weak (I think most of it is frankly, garbage!).  There are to many gimicks and unsuccessful recording experiments being used here.  Beatle fans can be very overbaring and quite annoying, feeling that anything the Beatles did is a holy grail of sorts, NONSENSE! Revolver and Rubber Soul are much stronger, and while the White Album could have been stripped down to 18-20 tracks, it is mostly excellent.  Abbey Road is overrated as well, lot of garbage on that album, including the terrible Maxwell's Hammer and Octopus' Garden.

"I bought this after I had Beatles One for a couple of years. It was also the first album from the '60s i bought.

First of all, the sound quality is awful! EMI did a slipshod job reproducing this album for CD. Makes it pretty bad to listen to on headphones. Whats sadder is that it detracts slightly from the songs. Makes it pretty bad to listen to on headphones. I still don't know how the songs sounded on original vinyl release. I wasn't around for the original release as I wasn't born yet. What got me even more upset is that they changed the song order, as stated in the liner notes. Why? Who knows? But when I buy a cd I want to hear it as it was intended to be heard. Especially if its a concept album of sorts. That's one of my biggest pet peeves.

Okay now on to the actual album. I think the album is good, a bit uneven.

The songs are good. Not great, but good (with the exception of the masterpiece A Day In The Life). She's Leaving Home is the one of the only low points. It becomes skipible after a couple of listens. I think this version of Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is one of the tracks that the EMI's new slipshod production has actually hurt. Along many of the other tracks. Which is a major shame because it sounds like it could be such a pretty song.

The way I see this album is that its the first album to have all this innovated studio wizardry (on original release; as I mentioned, the EMI production has hurt it considerably). It's probably not the beatles best, but it's one of their most ambitious and one of the most ambitious record of it's time.

I suggest to a person just starting to discover the beatles (as i am still), go for the compilation One (even though the production isn't better).",4.0

I wish George wrote some more tracks for this album, he's not a bad writer at all.  I just got this album, & it's really nice.
I like mostly every track on this album; I think the song ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" is so cute, I can play that song over & over again, it's a happy song.

"1967 was a turning point in the Beatles' history. Some were predicting their break up three years before it happened, and music was constantly changing, due to Bob Dylan and other innovative. Could the Beatles match these new contenders to the musical crown? The answer (happily for as of us) was a resounding YES. Without the burden of touring or making endless publicity appearances, the' Fab Four' were free to push the boundaries in the Abbey Road studios. What resulted was the most experimental Beatles album to date, with topics ranging from a Circus to filling the Albert Hall's holes. That being said, there are some weak numbers (` Within You, Without You' springs chiefly to mind), but this monumental release stills stands proudly of what innovations can be found or created in rock music. PEPPER was such a trend setting release, Frank Zappa and his Mothers of Invention ruthlessly parodied it in their masterpiece, 'We're Only In It For The Money'.PEPPER is not the Beatles Best album ever, but a top contender for 'classic album of the pyschedelic era'.
SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND - After some tuning and audience hushing, the band hits the stage. A good `rocky' album opener; McCartney using his  `Little Richard ` voice. Paul wrote this after catching a glimpse at some of the outlandishly named bands from the U.S. George Harrison's lead guitar break stings like a swarm of wasps. After a brilliantly harmonised band introduction, Billy Shears, the leader of the band is introduced . . .
WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS - Ringo's token appearance on the album, answering a set of musical questions levelled at him by the remaining Beatles. Not the first time the others would write a song for their drummer, this has got to be among the best songs he ever tackled. Later transformed into a blues-rock hit single by Joe Cocker and his Grease Band.
LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS - This track pushed the `fab four' into the role of leaders for the psychedelic movements. John Lennon's love of Lewis Carroll is never more in view, as the listener is taken to another world full of newspaper taxis and rocking horse people. It shows the man's genius that he can make a rock classic out of simple painting drawn by his son Julian. Lennon's voice sounds otherworldly and the organ is a nice touch.
GETTING BETTER - Although this bouncy track is sung by McCartney, the lyrics better suit the character of Lennon who was always the `rebellious' Beatle. Paul has started that when `McCartney /Lennon' wrote together, Paul was the optimist and John the pessimist. This is shown in the chorus: ""It's getting better all the time . . .it can't get much worse"".
FIXING A HOLE - An offbeat little number with Paul happy doing his own thing in his own time, regardless what other people will do or say. Harrison's lead work rings like a bell. One of the few songs from this album that could have been played live by the `two guitars, a bass and drums' set up.
SHE'S LEAVING HOME - A heart-rending ballad about the generation gap and the search for freedom and fun. Paul's' voice is mellow and sad; the use of Lennon singing the role of the parents was a masterstroke, it adds to the realism. When producer George Martin could not do the orchestral arrangement for this track fast enough for Paul, an outside arranger was brought in; as expected this caused a bit of contention between Martin and McCartney.
BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE - Lyrics taken almost verbatim for a Victorian era Circus poster found in an Op Shop. The carnival like atmosphere is helped by the calliope loop in the song's mixed (achieved when Martin cut up tapes of calliope music into chunks, threw them into the air and then randomly rejoined them). You get the feeling that if the poster had never existed, John would have written the song anyway.
WITHIN YOU, WITHOUT YOU - George Harrison being `incredibly cosmic' with another slice of raga rock; his only contribution to the album. Stephen Stills has a stone in his garden with the lyrics to this song inscribed on them. Not one of my favourite Harrison songs. I would've preferred `Only A Northern Song' which was attempted during this period.
WHEN I'M 64 - Just think, Paul McCartney can have his questions answered in a couple of years! Written in the early years of the Beatles for his father, McCartney shows his love for earlier English musical styles, which turns up again later in `Your Mother Should Know `, Honey Pie' and `Martha My Dear'.
LOVELY RITA - An underrated, jaunty number concerning Paul's failed seduction of a meter maid. Shows that Paul could be just as saucy and witty as John when the mood took him. Ending slips at the climax into weirdness and collapse.
GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING - John considered this exciting track a `throwaway number'. I beg to disagree with him. Never has the mundane been painted with such a witty brush. This is a portrait of everyday life in sixties' Britain and Harrison helps ram the point home by a stabbing lead break. Ringo is allowed to roam all over his drum kit after Martin unleashes an entire menagerie upon us, courtesy of a SFX library. One of Martin's acclaimed tricks on this album was the transformation from a chicken clucking into a George Harrison guitar note, signalling . . .
SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEART'S CLUB BAND (REPRISE) - At a quicker pace, the band signs off, and that would be that were it not for a soft guitar slowly rising in the mix . . .
A DAY IN THE LIFE - This has to rank with `Strawberry Fields Forever' as John Lennon's greatest song (with help from Paul in the middle section). A reading of the news turns into a `musical orgasm' not once, but twice. The song includes a lid banging shut, a roadie (Mal Evans) counting down, and an alarm clock going off. People have written article upon article,dissecting all the aspects of the is song; and rightly so. The album would suffered if it was excluded.",4.0
"There can be no doubt this album was unlike anything heard -- or seen -- before in pop music. The gate-fold album cover, the lyrics printed on the back, and the exotic sounds inside all showed the Beatles had turned the world of pop music inside out, just four years after issuing their first album. However, I wish I'd first heard this album then -- in 1967 -- so I could hear how revolutionary it was. Because by the time I heard it, 10 years later, some of its magic had worn off. There is still some incredible music here -- but I agree with most reviewers that it doesn't quite measure up to REVOLVER or ABBEY ROAD. One thing is clear -- this album was Paul McCartney's baby (and producer George Martin's), and it's easy to see why, in later years, Paul was the only Beatle who still sung its praises. John Lennon tended to debunk it, George Harrison said he wasn't all that interested in it, and Ringo Starr said he learned to play chess during the long, drawn out process of recording it. That said, there are great moments on it. We hear Ringo's finest vocal performance ever -- the one and only Billy Shears gives it all he's got on ""With a Little Help From My Friends"". John's ""Lucy in the Sky"" is a beautiful song, with George showing the influence India had had on his playing by mimicing John's vocal line with his guitar. Those influences were stronger still, of course, on Harrison's own contribution, ""Within You Without You"". Again, that must have sounded revolutionary in 1967, but nowadays, it cries out for editing --- shorten it by a couple of minutes and it would be fine! The most jarring moment of the album comes right after that -- we jump immediately from Harrison's mystic excursion to the goofy vaudeville clarinets of Paul's ""When I'm 64"". Every time I hear that song, I wonder what kind of self-respecting rock band could put out a number like this! McCartney's bass-playing, however, was stellar throughout, and show why Lennon, even at his angriest, would still call Paul the best bass-player in the business. And McCartney did have some good stuff here --""Lovely Rita"" and ""Fixing a Hole"" are enjoyable -- especially George's extended guitar solo in the latter -- and ""She's Leaving Home"" is beautifully crafted -- especially the way John's counter melody blends with Paul's main theme. Yeah, I know it's a tear-jerker, but it still puts a lump in my throat.  There are other interesting moments -- the swirling ""Mr Kite"", the honking brass and Paul's scorching guitar solo on ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" -- and I love the hen-cluck that turns into a guitar note as Sgt Pepper's Band comes out to say good night.  But the one song that lifts PEPPER to the top ten of the all-time album list is the final one. ""A Day In the Life"" is such an extraordinary piece that it DEMANDS that you play the entire album over again, just to again be swept up in its incredible power. Lennon's eery, haunting vocal throughout and the vortex of noise that attack us -- TWICE -- followed by the crashing piano chord at the very end -- leave the listener breathless in their wake. Ringo's drumming was never more effective.  And Paul's ""ahhhh"" that floats over the orchestral bridge that takes us from his section back to John's is a thing of beauty.  This may be the very best Beatles song of all time!  On the whole, PEPPER was definitely a strong album, and it's an essential part of anyone's Beatle collection. But oh, how much stronger it would have been had two songs originally meant to be part of it -- ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane"" -- not been pulled in order to be released as a single (in those days, the Beatles tried to avoid their singles also being included on albums).",4.0
"Half this album's allure, at the time and historically, stems from the cover.
 Many of the songs, Lovely Rita, Good Morning, Fixing a Hole, She's Leaving Home, are not that strong. The title song sounds like a [bad] version of Drive My Car.
Only Lucy in the Sky and Day in the Life are enduring classics. If they hadn't adorned the album with weird sounds and a fantastic cover, it might have been panned like Magical Mystery Tour, which in many ways is a stronger album.",4.0
"An interesting experiement that shows the Beatles at their most non-rockish (I consider them a pop band with a rock sensibility).
However, I don't think they really went as far as they thought they would, as this whole album just sounds... unfinished. I also found my attention wandering during ""Within You Without You"" and ""When I'm 64"", which are both a little boring to me.
Ringo sings ""With a Little Help"" in his best melancholy voice. John can sing like he's sneering at you, George can get preachy, and Paul can sound a little self-important, but Ringo always sings with warmth in his voice. He really shines on this one.
Lennon adds some great lyrical touches to ""She's Leaving Home"" which shows the parents perspective, and keeps the song from being too melodramatic.
""Lovely Rita Meter Maid"" is a great little song, with an excellent intro and inventive melody. The horns make ""Good Morning Good Morning"" startling, and George adds some life to this album with his searing guitar solo.
""A Day in the Life"" is brilliant, and the reason why I'm giving this album four stars instead of three. George sets the mood with a pensive and contemplative guitar intro, and Ringo adds some descriptive drum flourishes. John and Paul play off of each other's strengths to present a song containing two contrasting viewpoints of life: the man who sees something is wrong and wants to ""turn you on"", and the man who just wants to get to work and get through the day. George Martin underlines all of this with his excellent orchestral score. This song is the ultimate example of all of the Beatles (Beatle #5 included) pooling their strenghts to produce a brilliant piece of work.
The rest of the album, though, doesn't quite live up to that level.",4.0
"What is there to say about this album that really hasn't been said? Influential? Revolutionary? Legendary? We've heard it all and excepted it. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the LP that typically gets the most praise. A few of The Beatles' signature songs are here, such as Lennon's trippy 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' about a picture Julian drew, 'With A Little Help From My Friends', Ringo's second lead vocal, and the incomparable 'A Day In The Life.' Despite having quite a few great songs, it also contains quite a few not-so-great songs, such as the forgettable 'Lovely Rita' and poppish 'Good Morning Good Morning.' The songwriting isn't always consistent either, really, not as consistent as say, 'Revolver' or even 'Abbey Road' for the most part. (The album would've undeniably been stronger just with the inclusion of 'Strawberry Fields Forever' which was slated for the album, but was released as a single with 'Penny Lane'.)
The real star of the show; however, is producer George Martin who introduces so many tricks to this inconsistent album. His recording techniques and addition of many sound effects make this album still a sonic marvel today, not to mention his great brass and string arrangements. Just the way the songs flow into each other sounds fresh.
Despite having much better technology today, Sgt. Pepper still sounds great. It's relevence today is still huge. 'Getting Better' has been made famous by Magnavox and who could forget the legendary cover art (which is chocked full o' ""Paul is dead"" referrences)? Everybody from the Rolling Stones to The Simpsons has made referrences to Sgt. Pepper in a way. This is probably not the greatest rock album ever, or even The Beatles' best really, in terms of songwriting, but who cares? This may have been their most significant album in terms of what it introduced to the world of popular music. (And if it's not, then I'd put my money on 'Revolver'.)",4.0
"No, not really, but close.  A Day in the Life remains one of the Beatles finest tracks, but the rest of this pretty can be summed up as merely good.  The production of this record was extremely influential, however not always in a good way.  It's impossible to think of how many overreaching, pretentous pychedelic disasters followed in it's wake.  This is good, as a piece, but I'll take the White Album, Abbey Road or Revolver anyday.",4.0
"I decided to take a break from Elton John for awhile and listen to another band. My dad kept bragging about how wonderful and oringinal they were. Taking his word I radomly bought Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Here is my review.

2.""With a little help from my friends"" was a nice friendly layed back too with fun lyrics. Yay!
3. Lucy in the sky with diamonds"" it had unusual lyrics but it was catchy with pure imagination. Yay!
4.""Getting better"" A pleasant song that made me feel happy about my self. Yay!
5.""Fixing a hole."" Not a bad an unusual subject with nice sixties feel. Yay!
6.""She leaving home"" Ugh! Too lengthy and depressing. Boo!
7.""Being the benefit of Mr. Kite."" Great Hipie song. Yay!
8.""Within you without you."" Same as track six. Boo!
9.""When I'm sixty-four"" A fun song about old folks. Yay!

"Hi.  Earlier I wrote a review that I didn't think was offensive or anything.  And for whatever reason Amalgamated decided not to publish it.  I guess it wasn't good for album sales.  Any-hoo.  Let's disect Amalgamated's accepted review of this album:
Before Sgt. Pepper, no one seriously thought of rock music as actual art.  (really?  I do believe the top ""rock"" song-writers of the time (including Misters Lennon and McCartney considered their own idols (Berry, Holly, etc.) artists and considered the music they played art.)
That all changed in 1967, though, when John, Paul, George and Ringo (with ""A Little Help"" from their friend, producer George Martin) created an undeniable work of art which remains, after 30-plus years, one of the most influential albums of all time.
(who exactly has it influenced directly?  XTC?  Who else?  Hmmmm.)
From Lennon's evocative word/sound pictures (the trippy ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,"" the carnival-like ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"") and McCartney's music hall-styled ""When I'm 64,"" to Harrison's Eastern-leaning ""Within You Without You,"" and the avant-garde mini-suite, ""A Day in the Life,"" Sgt. Pepper was a milestone for both '60s music and popular culture.  (well, ain't that a gas!)
Here's the truth of the matter.  1967 was the year of corporate rock psychedlia.  But you know what 1967 was just one year, and everything that came out in 1968 sure didn't sound like 1967.  The truth of the matter boys and girls is this:  Pound for pound this album doesn't add up to a classic album and song for song doesn't match up to the Beatles' best LP's.  The first four songs, and four of the last five songs are classic pop/rock songs.  The middle tracks are weak and/or dated material.  If they had stuck strawberry fields and penny lane in the middle in place of fixing a hole and benefit of mr. kite, THEN it would be one of the greatst LP's ever.",4.0
"The only reason why I gave Sg. Pepper 4 stars is because I got sick of it. But I remember every night listening to it striaght through, over and over again. Some say that ""Within you without you"" is the one song they skip over, but they obviously haven't given it enough consideration. They hear the sitars and they just bug out. This is world music. Yes, it's different than the normal electric guitars, bass, and drums for a band, but it's a great song. It's very melodic. A Day in the Life is a classic, and I think often overlooked, Beatles song. From the beginning fatalism and surrealism to Paul's little solo vocal down to the crashing last piano chord, the song is just powerful. This may be one the best CDs to give someone who is just being introduced to the Beatles or they don't have it and they are fans. That or the Imagine Soundtrack. That is a great CD too.",4.0
"Sgt. Peppers is a good album to to call it one of the best ever and Beatles best ever is pathetic! Like one other reviewer said, Magicla Mystery Tour is so much better than this album but in my opinion is still sadly overlooked because of the film that came along with it and usually people are so turned away fro that they don't give the album the respect that it's due. Sure Pepper's has some great songs on it (A Day In The Life is quite possibly one of their best and one of the best songs ever by anyone)and other songs like Lovely Rita, Getting Better, With A Little Help, and Lucy are good but the rest is filler and throw aways. So what if Lennon took the entire song for Mr. Kite off a Circus poster...the song isn't that great. Fixing A Hole is a very weak tune as is the title track which really isn't much (neither is the reprise except for it's used mainly as a intro to A Day In The Life). To me when I sit there and listen to an album like this and Pet Sounds they don't sound like anything special (Pet Sounds has a few good songs)but of course back in the day they were revolutionary and things nobody has heard before but as the years went on they lost their power and aren't as influental to generations that were not old enough to buy those albums. Many will disagree with me but I feel nothing can compare to The White Album...by far the Beatles best because it's all four of them getting chances to contribute unlike the previous albums where Ringo and George (r.i.p.) were given one of two songs and most of the time they didn't pull them off very well. While many complain that album is way too long in my opinion it's not at all. That album was such a revolution and such a different album for those times and was a bigger influence on many bands to come than Sgt. Pepper's ever would be. I'm not saying don't get Sgt. Peppers because it's worth a listen and while these are personal opinions only you may or may not disagree with me but I still feel this album (and even Abbey Road)are the bands most overrated albums to date while Thw White Album, Magical Mystery Tour and even Let It Be are sadly overlooked albums for various reasons which don't seem good!",4.0
"It may not be the best Beatles CD, but I have a hard time picking out a better album that is not by the Beatles (as a band or solo). If you like classic music, you'll love Sgt. Petter.",4.0
"After ""Revolver,"" the Beatles retired from public performance and penned two songs: 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'Penny Lane.' While neither song made it onto what was to become ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band,"" they manifested the new direction the band would take.
The amount of time, money, and production that went into the making of this album was completely unprecedented. It has been called the first concept album, but as the Beatles' themeslves admitted, it failed as such.
However, the Beatles did manage to up the ante again here. The songwriting was still magical. 'A Day in the Life' was the high point of it all, absolutely one of the greatest songs the band ever recored. Inasmuch as this album is one of the most famous in history and a great achivement in its' own right, it is my opinion that the Beatles had begun to drift away from what made ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"" so perfected by simply trying a bit too hard.
The Beatles shot for the moon on this one, and they came very close.",4.0
"...sadly, no. The best Beatles album of all time? ...no, afraid not. The most important record of all time? ...yep, i can agree with that.
 Sgt. Pepper is undoubtedly the most influential album of all time. The way in which the album (pretty much McCartney's love child) placed the most extreme demands on the producer, George Martin, and the way in which he himself met those demands had never been seen before. And it is Martin who is really the unsung hero of this album.
 While hints at experimentation had been given in 1966's wonderful Revolver, it was here that the Beatles really pushed the boat out. The sheer scope of the album is impressive; the range of instruments used; the range of styles; the extraordinary overlapping techniques used to create the most wonderful sound effects - listen to ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" cranked up to max volume with headphones and you can really hear the exquisite overworldy detail that misses you on initial listenings.
 As beautifully constructed as this album is, it should not take away from that actual music. Yes, this is a majorly significant album, but is it a masterpiece?
 The answer is no. While their are great songs here, there are also average ones. ""Good Morning, Good Morning"", is the weakest, the quality of the song not meeting the quality of the production values. ""Fixing A Hole"" ""Getting Better"" and ""With a Little Help from my Friends"" are all enjoyable songs, but none of them make you go ""Wow!"" And I, myself, just have no time for Georhe Harrison's sitar songs, so ""Within You, Without You"" is not for me.
 The album does have two great tracks, though; ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" is a wonderfully bouncy, non-sensical Lennon number, much like his later ""I Am the Walrus."" And then there is ""Day in the Life"" a contender for best Beatles song of all time. Basically cobbled together from a Lennon song and a McCartney song, it shows them both at the height of their song writing powers.
 The album is not as themed as it would like you to think. In fact, only the beginning and ending Pepper reprise offers any kind of continuity. But this doesn't matter, Pepper is still enjoyable. Probably not the best Beatles album to start with, as it can take a while to crack into, but there is reward if your persistant.
 To end with, i want to recount a story about the realease of Pepper. Two days after it was released, McCartney and Harrison went to see Jimi Hendrix in concert. Hendrix opened with Sgt. Pepper. In only a short space of time he had not only learnt the piece, but added his won guitar solo. McCartney and Harrison were in disbelief, and McCartney was quoted as saying that Hendrix's version was a vast improvement on the original. And that kind of sums up the album, not bad, but, with all the resources at their disposal, a missed opportunity!",4.0
"""Sgt. Pepper"" is often hailed as the Beatles' greatest work: Their crowning achievement. Is it? Yes and no. In terms of musical ambition and experimentation, ABSOLUTELY. Any other artist would kill to call this album their own. It's been the source of inspiration for countless artists over the years, but no one has ever come close to equaling it, and it's likely that no one ever will. Judged solely on the strength of its songs, however, this isn't the Beatles' finest album--That honor goes to either ""Rubber Soul"" or ""Revolver.""
That being said, this is still a fascinating album to listen to, and I'd recommend this CD in a heartbeat to anyone whose musical tastes aren't limited to the ""flavor of the week."" It's staggering to hear just how far the Beatles had progressed musically from their ""Please Please Me"" and ""Love Me Do"" period. The Beatles were leading the pack here, and imitating NOBODY. I don't envy the critics who had to review this album when it first came out back in 1967. How could one judge songs like ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" or ""A Day In The Life,"" based on what had come before them? The Beatles ignored all the boundaries, and created new ones.
I had a good laugh when I read the review that gave this CD one star and assigned passing or failing (mostly failing) grades to each song. This guy reminds me of one of my old high-school teachers, who was very arrogant but would have flunked out of his own class.",4.0
"This album certainly expanded the boundaries of what pop music could be, but in doing so strays a little far from the roots of rock for my tastes. I find the almost complete absence of George Martin's name from other reviews to be vexing. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison all do their part, to be sure, but I don't think George Martin gets enough credit (not just for this album but for The Beatles, period). In short, it's a must-have, but on the whole, give me Revolver.",4.0
"With this, their eighth release, The Beatles continue on their musical journey. A conceptually brilliant recording, as well as highly creative for its time, it is a much more musically cohesive work than its predecessor, ""Revolver"". Yet, I believe ""Revolver"" had better songs, overall, even though it can't touch the production values inherent in this recording, nor the social impact that this recording had. Quite simply, it summed up an era.

This recording was on the cutting edge for its time, and it was a very definite, new direction for the Fab Four, as they seemed to want to shed their original mop haired image with all due speed. It was a psychedelic precursor of the youth revolution that was to come. Flower power was just around the corner, as was the so called psychedelic drug craze.
Some of the songs on this recording heralded the new era. The whimsical ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" was the mantra for this movement, while the mournful refrains of ""She's Leaving Home"" illustrated the general disaffection of youth which was so prevalent at the time. ""A Little Help From My Friends"" was certainly the blueprint for getting along for many baby boomers during that era which this recording heralded.

For many reasons, this remains one of the most important and seminal recordings ever made, and no music collection should be without it.",4.0
"Many differences between the mono and stereo versions. See for yourself, its fun!",4.0
"Is Sgt. Pepper The Beatles' best album? I don't think so. Rubber Soul is probably that. That doesn't mean that this isn't a bad album, and it isn't in any way imaginable. This is just simply a very nice expierience. When  you boil the whole thing down to just the music, it is easier to focus on  it, then from being distracted by the artwork and printed lyrics and paper  dolls etc. Sgt Pepper - A really nice opening track. It is, more or less,  filler, but that doesn't mean filler has to be bad. This just basically  sets up the whole album, and does it effectively. With A Little Help From  My Friends - This one isn't quite filler, and it is a Paul song being sung  by Ringo (who does a pretty nice job). Lucy In The Sky - Wordplay and  lyrical images fill the song, which is more or less a trip 'Through The  Looking Glass'. John provides the vocals here and does a good job, though  the way his voice is sped up in the middle eight is bad sounding. Getting  Better - An optimistic, yet slightly sinister track by Paul and John.  Darker lyrics than most earlier Beatle songs here, and they work well. It  is currently being butchered in Phillips commercials around the country.  Fixing a Hole - whatever anyone says this song is supposed to mean doesn't  really matter, the song isn't really specific enough to keep you from  trying to find out multiple meanings. A decent song, but a slightly  unnerving melody bogs it down. She's Leaving Home - It takes a few listens  to this to fully appreciate it, but it is worth it. Lyrics that really tell  a story accompained by soap-opera-like music. And to boot, the song also  has a moral (listen the person out, don't make assumptions by yourself).  Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite - Lennon generally reading off of a  circus poster. This one is just average: the music sets the mood but really  isn't all that good, but the lyrics are above average. Within You Without  You - George doing his Ravi Shankar-Indian music thing. This mixes with the  rest of the album like oil and water. It really doesn't do anything for the  album, but it's not a horrible songwriting attempt by George. When I'm 64 -  Probably the worst music on the album. The lyrics aren't terrible, but they  aren't great either. Sub-par. Lovely Rita - Not too bad music or lyrics,  but the vocals aren't very good. It sounds like they played the instruments  for this one while they were drunk. Good Morning Good Morning - A generally  good song. Good lyrically, good musically, Good morning Good morning. Not  to mention it has a really good guitar solo. Sgt. Pepper (reprise)- More  downright fun and rocking than the first track. They could have made this  track a bit longer, but it serves its purpose which I suppose was all it  was meant to do. A Day In The Life - Absolute Nirvana. This is a great song  by John and Paul, and is a fantastic closer to the album. The only problem  with it is that there's no never-ending 'inner groove' on the CD. Well,  that's it. Sgt. Pepper is a really good album, slight blemishes and all,  but I think it is a tad too much on the poppy side with not enough true  rock songs on it. Still, a neccesary album for any cd (or record)  collection.",4.0
"33 years ago I was struck by how I had just listened to a musical work and not a collection of disconnected tracks by a given artist.  After untold replays the realization slowly came to me ... the unifing emotion of this  album ... as nearly as I can define it in a single word ... the emotion  that cried out from each track ... is loneliness.  Of course you may not  feel it or feel something quite different.  But that is what makes this a  ""concept"" album and one of the greatest of the rock era ... that  it is a single opus.",4.0
"When will someone acknowledge that the enormous popularity of the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was as much a consequence of opportunity  and demographics as it was musical artistry. The year was 1968  and tens of millions of Baby Boomers (now outnumbering their parents and  grand parents) were teenagers with spending money in their pockets.  Teenagers had been buying rock'n'roll records since Bill Haley and the  Comets released `Rock Around The Clock.' But the 60's decade was different:  never before had there been so many kids with so much cash (economists call  it `disposable income'). Teenagers bought fast cars, fast food and millions  of those black vinyl things.
The one commonality of all Baby Boomers was  the War in Vietnam. Teenagers were either waiting to go to Vietnam, in  Vietnam, coming home from Vietnam (perhaps), or doing their damnedest to  stay out of Vietnam. The War was an American invention, and so was  rock'n'roll. Teenagers denounced everything institutional and embraced  anything foreign. The British Invasion, led by the Beatles, was scarcely an  invasion at all: it was a welcoming party given by the Baby Boomers. The  Beatles were at the right place at the right time. Sure Sgt. Pepper was the  art album of the decade, but more importantly it was the Great Escape. One  could understand the assignation of President Kennedy `With A Little Help  From My Friends.' `When I'm Sixty-Four' was an optimistic ditty if your  draft number was 1,000 and they had just called 999. `A Day In The Life'  was an ideal way to reflect on America's greatest (and dead) civil rights  leader - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. If you were unfortunate enough to have  suffered the Tet Offensive, `Lovely Rita' (your girl back in the world) was  the only thing that kept you going. And lastly, `Good Morning Good Morning'  was a sardonic greeting shouted by police during the Democratic National  Convention in Chicago. Sgt. Pepper defined a generation? Nonsense. The  generation defined Sgt. Pepper.",4.0
"I always preceived Sgt. Pepper as an event or a work of art, because that's what I was told. Before I owned my own copy I had been lectured to about it. I had read and watched and listened as this, along with many  other Beatle albums, but this one in particular, was disected and discussed  and hailed as their masterpiece.
Sound familiar? This wasn't 1967. It  was 1987. I had an LP of Pepper and later a cassette. I didn't get the CD  until the mid 90's, and it was then that I sat down and listened, really  listened, and made up my mind for myself.
I found that, like the other  Beatle albums I have, there are songs here I love, some a like, and some I  just don't like.
By far ""A Day In The Life"" is my favorite  track. The opening, ""With A Little Help..."" and ""Lucy""  are all great, along with ""Lovely Rita"". I think the packaging is  probably the best thing about the album and for me, it sort of overshadows  and helps hide what may be the weaker songs. This is just my honest  opinion. In the terms of Beatles albums there are just a few more that I  love better and find much more enjoyable. I'm not in any way knocking  Pepper.
I have to agree with people who say that ""Strawberry  Fields"" and ""Penny Lane"" probably should have been on here.",4.0
"OK, bear with me. I'm 14 years old. I bought this on one of my Christmas binges along with the Harry Potter books. (haha, so sue me!) I was a bit wary at first- I mean, c'mon, this was the Beatles.. from my parents  generation! But then I popped the CD in and absolutely fell in love.
I  loved the intro, and ""I Get by.."" then nearly fell off my bed  when I heard the opening lyrics. I had no idea that this was where the  Wonder Years song had originated from. Naive teenage Americans, aye?
I  hated ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" at first- until Old Johnny  Boy broke out into the chorus! Then I totally fell in love. ""Getting  Better"" also surprised me. I mentioned to my mother, ""Hey, isn't  that the song on that commercial?"" I adore it to this day, and my mom  still teases me about it.
The next few songs range from OK to completely  unbearable, until you hit ""When I'm 64."" I thought this was the  most adorable song ever! Lovely Rita is so/so, as well as ""Good  Morning, Good Morning.""
The reprise is awesome. And  then..
""A Day in the Life.""
I love this song. Honest to  goodness. When Paul first said, I want to turn you on.. It literally sent  chills down my spine. This song just rocks.
Well, thats my theory. While  most of the songs were just OK.. the songs that are honestly awesome, they  just make the entire CD seem perfect.
But I just can't stand ""She's  Leaving Home."" It's atrocious.",4.0
"Sure, Sgt. Pepper did influence rock and roll forever but is it all it's cracked up to be? Yes and no. First, the reason for no is Lennon's contributions. Most of the songs he wrote are not bad but not great. Songs  like ""Mr. Kite"" and ""Good Morning"" lack focus. But then  there is the classic ""Lucy in the Sky..."" with it's great organ  line. And yes, basically for the greatest song ever recorded, ""A Day  in the Life."" It almost sounds like the end of the world to me. If no  other reason get the album for this song. I'm sure you'll enjoy almost all  of the material even if most of it is McCartney's style of pop. But some of  his best stuff is on this record.",4.0
Don't get me wrong I'm the biggest Beatles fan in the world but to say Sgt.

That's not  necessarily a bad thing; ""When I'm 64"" is a charming ditty,  ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" is good, noisy pop update to  Revolver's ""Good Day Sunshine,"" but this is not the best rock  album of all time. It's noteworthy for its breakthrough production  techniques, and for the cover, and for the Sgt Pepper concept. But if we're  just judging the music, it gets a very solid 4 stars in my book.",4.0
Interesting articles. Good for reading comprehension. nicely organized. I would like more hands on projects to reinforce what we are learning.,4.0
"dry, but not wasted time",4.0
"Great book good articles and great questions

really informative

my kids like it and although a bit difficult at times I help them get through it",4.0
"showed me where my private school kid is actually behind, not her fault but rather the school. we plan ti change to public school in a good school district",4.0
I bought this as a science resource for homeschool. It is not a complete resource. It is a great supplement if you have other tools but just not to be confused with a full resource tool for this grade level.,4.0
i like this book it's a really good book. my boys like it. i can't wait to do some experiments.,4.0
"Very informative. This book helps my 6th grader to understand how our world works. I would prefer it to be a little longer so it would last the whole school year. I would recommend this science book, it was very helpful.",4.0
"If you're a teacher looking for something to supplement your classroom teaching, this Spectrum Science Grade 6 book provides some excellent, in-depth exercises. These are very useful for homework assignments. If you're a parent looking for some at-home science practice/enrichment for your child, I think this is a great tool to use for reinforcement of certain topic areas.

Each chapter is divided into 9 lessons, and each lesson is compact so in other words, you don't need a science textbook to complete the exercises. Also, these lessons are cross-curriculum in that they incorporate reading comprehension. The lessons consist of a short but comprehensive text with important vocabulary listed in a sidebar, and the text is followed by a set of questions which are usually a mixture of multiple choice and writing out a response.

Each chapter has a 2-page Chapter Review Test. There is one Mid-Test covering chapters 1-3, and there is a Final Test covering Chapters 1-7. An Answer Key is also provided.

A great resource to have, in or out of the classroom. Easy to use, nicely organized, with interesting science topics to challenge and encourage learners as the lessons are just challenging enough to enrich but not frustrate.",4.0
"This book provides a wide variety of topics for a general science instruction for my homeschooled sixth grader.  It is well written, and well organized.  The questions are easy to answer, a good thing for my student who doesn't love to write.  I have always been pleased with the Spectrum series, and this book is no
different.",4.0
"Great book good articles and great questions

really informative

It is a little easy for my 2nd grader that going to 3rd grade in fall. But I like the short story and questions.,4.0
This is a great Science book. We are using it for our homeschool and it is going very well. The kids like the lesson and questions format.,4.0
"Laminated. Good size, nice quality.  The dot/square reference method can be confusing.  Sometimes it takes me quite a while to decipher what muscle they are indicating.  This is a very basic trigger chart and does not have many triggers/muscles listed.  I use it more to introduce the concept to my clients and less as a reference.",4.0
"I purchased this product to have for my massage therapy business. As soon as I get them framed, they will come in handy.",4.0
"thinner weigh paper than i expected, but cant beat the price.
want to find hangers to put it up properly without having to frame",4.0
"The map is very big approx. 56"" x 43"". N and S America are on the left side with an international date line. For the price this is a great map. I bought it to put marks on places we have been. It is not detailed enough for me, but I am going to take it to my office and hang it. Came quickly and highly recommend it.",4.0
"This is a great map for the price, and BIG - about 3x4 FEET.  Nice, heavy paper.  The only thing is, there are not a lot of boundary lines, and it has the US/Canada/SA on the RIGHT side of the map.  But...we are using it on our wall for homeschool and we paste different things onto it, for which it has been very useful.  If you're looking for a super-detailed map, you need to look elsewhere.  But we've really enjoyed this one, and it actually helps us to learn because we do have to look up a few things in our atlas to find them on this map.",4.0
"This map has been a handsome addition to my office at work and is, of course, an excellent conversation piece and learning tool. The text boxes to the bottom and right of the map do a good job of explaining the reasoning behind the map, and how map designs influence, and are influenced by, cultural bias. The text boxes don't explain, however, how the Peters Projection itself is not free from cultural chauvanism, and I consider this an oversight. I've made several observations about the map that I feel should be addressed on the maps' right text panel:

- The map is oriented north-up and nearly meridian-centered, as with the Mercator Projection. Granted, centering on either the meridian or International Date Line (""IDL"") is necessary if one is to keep continents intact, but north-up orientation is not necessary for easy reading. The bottom panel mentions this to some degree while discussing the McArthur's Projection, but it's worth pointing out that Peters was a native of the northern hemisphere.

- The map is broken into rectangles representing equal surface area on the globe, with 100 equal-width edges running West-East (with 0 starting just east of the IDL) and 100 variable-length edges running north-south (with 0 at the north pole). Though the map's center rectangle width (50) isn't centered on the meridian, it does pass through Germany, putting Peters' native country at the center of his map.

- The color scheme makes North and South America alternating shades of green, Africa shades of yellow, Australasia shades of orange, the Middle East and Southeast Asia shades of purple, and Europe and Russia shades of salmon. I have yet to find an explanation for this color scheme. The uniform color scheme for the Americas and the separate schemes for Africa and Australasia suggest that isthmus-connected super-continents are to be borne in mind, but if that is the case, why isn't all of Eurasia the same color scheme? Similarly, coloring Russia and Turkey with the rest of Europe shows a clear bias toward considering those countries European, while clearly considering the increasingly-Europe-leaning Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan to be somehow less European than Russia or Turkey. There are certainly historical biases for doing this, but it isn't the purpose of this projection to neutralize such biases? Or is it a nod to the colonial ideal of color-coding humanity into distinct racial groups? European colonials tended to treat as one the separate peoples in each of these color-coded regions, and seeing them color-coded here is worth discussing.

All in all, the Peters Projection is an excellent teaching tool. It not only shows the reader new perspectives of the world, but it also shows that no map could ever escape the influence of the map-maker's own culture. My only real criticism is that the publishers at ODT laud the map for removing geopolitical biases while keeping silent on these three glaring examples of bias in favor of a northern-hemisphere and European interpretation of the world. Any complete assessment of this Peters Projection should both extol its virtues while acknowledging its shortcomings. Also, note that this map will have to change this summer due to the independence of Southern Sudan. (I'm using a white-board marker to draw in the new border on the laminate.)",4.0
I love having a male to scale that is a true reflection of our world. My only suggestion is that the continents of North and South America be made different colors.,4.0
"When we see this Peter Projection, true area comparisons come to light. This is very useful for relative geographic studies.",4.0
good resource,4.0
"I have read a couple of facilitation textbooks, but this one is definitely outstanding. It goes into the heart of why facilitation is necessary to unlock the potential of groups. We all make decisions although not always at the same time, which is often required by situations. If you want to advance people through the decision making process and want to arrive at best attention station, then you need this book in your toolbox.",4.0
"As an Art of Hosting student, this facilitator's guide turned out to be extremely useful. It includes loads of examples of techniques and exercises to help groups reach their objectives.  Can't wait to get the next edition which is out now.",4.0
Excellent resource for anyone facilitating a group process.  I train and coach a practice called High Fidelity Wraparound.  Kaners book confirmed elements of our practice and gave me some new ideas to think about.,4.0
Worth the read but at times the author dragged on through a few points that were better left as a sentence rather than a page.  Good list of techniques however.  Just too much time on general group psychology points that would have been better left on the cutting room floor.,4.0
The divergent and convergent thinking were discoursed several books but this one is more insightful and let us promptly to practice.  I developed a simple template for practice of both divergent and convergent dialog.  The help people can track this ideas and other person's ideas easier.  Thank you for author to inspire me more.,4.0
"Kaner includes a much-needed extension of the original brainstorming concept (Osborn, 1953). Rolestorming (R.E. Griggs, 1985) addresses two of the drawbacks to traditional brainstorming: a)teams run out of ideas too soon, b)the fear of public ridicule.  By combining role-playing + brainstorming, rolestorming asks participants to assume the role of a competitor, a friend, an idol, a celebrity or a well-known expert.  When a concept like brainstorming becomes generic, people tend to go brain-dead.  Rolestorming adds a creative 'sizzle' to the process of innovation.",4.0
"This book is very very easy to use, and delivers the content in a way that is both easy to grasp and to remember.

The most important part is that, while other books on this topic take you through an ideal process while only hinting at the roadblocks, THIS book tells you what problems are likely to come up, and gives ideas to address them.

Yes, the pages look VERY simplistic, and the large font reminds me of a children's text book, but it really sticks; made me laugh a few times too! (Actually, now that I think about it, it's more like a PowerPoint presentation style.)

Anyway, as a city planner who deals with the public a lot, I enjoyed it and found it useful enough that it will remain in my office library.",4.0
"Have you ever noticed that the promo photo shoots for buffy always make the characters ""cartoony"" and sometimes they look more tan than they do on the tv show, i always felt these photos are pics of the actors, not the characters...

ANYWAY, i love me some buffy, im just upset that ANYA doesnt get her own month... I am a 100% anya fan, she was a staple snoopy in the latter half of the show, and often times was the only one who would speak the truth when no one else would!

I mean, come on!! TARA gets her own month!?.... TAARA!!!???!!! UHG!",4.0
"Okay, so we were a little late as Buffy fans - we watched them all on DVD last summer - so my daughter was thrilled to find this calendar.  The pictures are rich and well-selected.",4.0
"The calendar is great in that it illustrates all characters from the show.  I honestly expected more Buffy, but no complaints.  Will likely get the 2011 based on this one.",4.0
"This was purchased as a Christmas present.  The receiver didn't have any complaints, so I suppose this is a good review.",4.0
"i love this show, i would love to of seen more pictures of tom welling & justin hartley, and none of aaron ashmore!  i like the idea of the group pictures, it gives a new twist to the calendar. for a real fan of the show this is a must every year!",4.0
"This is a very nicely-sized calendar, the pages are large, with medium-sized day boxes, not quite large enough for me. But, if you want to jot a few brief notes, the boxes will be adequate. All public holidays are well-marked, and  the day page is a soothing on the eye beige-type color. The prints and etchings surrounding the edges of the pages are very evocative of the Edwardian, and even the Victorian period. There is not much Art Deco to be seen here., although Downton certainly approaches that period.

The pages and the pictures for each month are enormous. The pictures of each month do not necessarily reflect the month shown,  and are lacking in explanations of the scene being shown. Of course if you are a Downton fan, you will very well know what each picture represents., but others, who buy the calendar to evoke a certain period in time, and a way of life that is long gone, might appreciative a few informative sentences explaining the happenings represented on each month's picture.

The photography is glorious. The paper stock used, is of high-quality, and each calendar page itself is very cute, and very quaint, this is not a grand calendar, in the Downton tradition, this imparts more of a cozy feeling, and it would definitely have been displayed downstairs, and not upstairs at Downton itself.

So, it is a bit confusing, the grand, very grand annd imposing picture of Downtom on the calendar cover, the very cute, and  the very well-chosen patterns, colors and arrangements of the calendar pages themselves. But, the photographs for each month are really not that exciting, indeed are a bit lackluster when  considering all of the drama and excitement that could have been represented in the pictures, and there really should be some text added to explain the occurrences in the pictures to non-Downton  fans.

So, a nice calendar of good quality, well-worth the price, but a bit let down by the less than exciting pictures on each day of the month. A Downton fan will love it, others, maybe not.

The price is surprisingly moderate, considering the run-away best seller that is the series, the quality is high, and it will look particularly nice hung  in a homey or old-fashioned kitchen. I just really wish that the monthly  photographs.had been more representative of the high-drama, and massive tragedy that has enticed much  of the world to the compulsive viewing, reviewing, and re-reviewing of this lovely soap opera.",4.0
"I love the photos, but was a little disappointed that the photos were from last season, not the upcoming and final one. Sigh. Oh, Well. Will not stop me from watching over and over again.",4.0
"I only started watching Downton Abbey last year and it has quickly become my favorite show. I love Downton memorabilia and just recently saw this wall calendar and knew I had to have it.  Incidentally enough, I still didn't own a 2016 wall calendar, so it was truly meant to be.

The calendar is a standard size calendar with high quality photographs.  The colors and images are beautiful, but like the majority of reviewers have stated, the selection of photos could have been better.  For instance, this month, I have a lone shot of Cora, whom I adore, but would have much rather had a group picture of the family or the serving staff and perhaps a couple of the estate. I love the cover picture and wish there were more shots like that.

If you're a fan, you won't mind the choice of photos for each month.  And for the current price, you're getting a great deal.",4.0
"DOWNTON ABBEY has won the hearts of countless millions, including myself. I was glad to see this calendar offered on AMAZON and at a good price. This is a great calendar that is well-made and well-designed. It is on heavy paper stock with glossy pictures. This is not a cheap looking calendar on lightweight paper. It will last through the year and I plan to keep it as a memento of this great show.
I am disappointed with some of the pictures chosen for this calendar. I would assume they had countless pictures to choose some but picked several that are poorly framed or show the backs of servants or side views of faces looking downward. Why show characters not facing the camera or partially off to the side.  Yes, all the pictures are nice and show specific moments from the show, but it seems like the creators could have used better pictures. Let's see the characters full faces. . Interesting enough, the back of the calendar as seen in the listing has one deviation from the calendar I have. Mine does not have the picture of Mr. Bates and Anna holding teacups. Mine has Carson and Mrs. Hughes instead and that picture is a disappointment. It's a profile of them but they are each off to the side so the middle of the picture is just wide open space. I would have liked to see more faces and more close-ups but still is a nice calendar. It's a high-quality calendar that could have made use of better pictures.",4.0
"I really like this calendar.  I usually buy one with antique teapots. Since this is the last season for Downton Abbey, it seemed right.",4.0
"I love the look of the calendar and anything with the characters but with that said, I feel like they did not pick the best pictures for each month otherwise this would have been a 5 for me. January's pic is a group of characters but most are looking downward and sad.",4.0
Beautiful calendar.,4.0
I like this calendar but the only thing I didn't think of when I purchased was being able to write on it because its in black. Otherwise very nice,4.0
"Anything lunar I like. The problem with this I can't write notes unless I buy special ink pen. The pages are black, the words in white ink. Looks busy. I use it just to look at every month different picture of the  moon.",4.0
This is a cool calendar but the glow in the dark part just doesn't seem to work well.,4.0
"Love the calendar, love the glow-in-the-dark element, but didn't like the fact that I couldn't use a regular pen to write on it. Quick fix: bought a $2 paint pen in white to write all my family and friends' birthdays on their specific days. Otherwise, couldn't be more pleased with my purchase!",4.0
"Pictures are beautiful, but buy a silver or white marker/pen to write with. I did not realize the background for the calendar itself is black.",4.0
Not as bright as others and disappointed that the moons don't glow in the dark.,4.0
"My wife is a true ""loney"" and loves to watch the moonrise, this calendar is great as it let's her keep track easily of the moons phase and dates of full moon. (TWO blue moons this year, Jan. and March.) and the images per month are very attractive.",4.0
I love the detailed information about the moon phases but this calendar does not glow in the dark which is one of the main reasons I purchased this.,4.0
"Doesn't ""glow"" as much as I had expected but I do like it.",4.0
This is a really nice calender. It glows in the dark which is cool. My only problem is the back ground is dark therefore I'm not able to add notes on the surface. Other then that I say thumbs up.,4.0
Good item.,4.0
"I purchsed this map for my Daughter's classroom.  It is very nice, the only thing it is missing is the flags of the different countries on it.  The one I ordered of Europe had the flags and the
students really liked that part of the map.",4.0
We got this map so we can pin where we have been. We just need to find something to attache it too.,4.0
Yes it was very helpful in determining my route to the National Parks,4.0
Very nice.  We're using it a lot!  Many years ago we'd bought US and World maps from National Geographic that we love.  We miss that this one isn't laminated.,4.0
not bad,4.0
"Map is great, but shipping damaged the edges, which is not good.",4.0
"This is super nice and very big. My only concern is that it is quite hard to follow roads on this map. I purchased this map to aid in a future road trip, and following the roads on this map is difficult. However, it is nice that it has some topographical information on it.",4.0
Came in a plastic tube and was a little crinkled on one end. Nothing laying flat didn't fix. Has tons of details including national parks.,4.0
Great may to bad the edges we damaged.,4.0
This map is exactly what I was looking for and it works perfectly for what I need it for.,4.0
This is the perfect display piece for the family travels!,4.0
Very small print but I'm not disappointed. Good quality materials.,4.0
"Great map, however, mine arrived with a wrinkle across it. Good news is it smoothed out relatively well once I adhered it to the cork board.",4.0
The map itself is excellent in detail but I did expect the lamination to be more robust as it appears to be virtually non existent to the extent that the map tears easily.,4.0
Fit our needs exactly,4.0
"Awesome map. I bought this spontaneously in an urge to have a large map in front of me. It was just what I needed. About 6' by 4' . displays many cities, small and large. Perfect for classrooms or travelers.

Amazon delivered as always on time and in good condition.",4.0
Great size and useful for helping my kids work out where places are and for planning our upcoming roadtrips.,4.0
easy to see and locate things,4.0
"Great size for looking and marking where my husband goes with his truck. Son is very excited. Loves that he can see where daddy is.

Some mid level towns not shown",4.0
Rather large but if you have the space it's a really nice map.  The size allows for a good deal of detail...lots of small towns and such. Much better for my needs in that regard than the National Geographic map of North America.,4.0
"Excellent for wall mounting, paper stock is heavy enough for handling .
Shipping container wasn't strong enough to protect the tube resulting in some crinkling of the map.",4.0
I wanted something to cover my whole bedroom wall and this map certainly did the trick. Very detailed and was easy to pin up.,4.0
"I just received the map without any damage. It was packed in a cardboard map/drawing box. And the map itself was packaged in a fully enclosed plastic tube. UPS left it in the snow and there was no moisture damage.

The map is printed on high quality paper and the printing is clear and bold.

The only disappointment was major rail routes are not shown even though the product description states ""All major cities, transportation ...are clearly displayed and labeled."" Hence only a four star rating.

If you do not need rail routes shown, then  this will make a great display maps of your American travels or a wall  reference map in the office/home/classroom.",4.0
"clarity is nice, almost exactly what I wanted. more secondary roads would have been nicer but It would probably have to be 10 wide.",4.0
"I like the map because you can see a lot of cities and compare how close they are to the one/s you are looking for.  My only concern was that the paper was thinner than I would have like, but once I frame it will hold up better.",4.0
I got it for my husband. He travels a lot for work and wanted to be able to see all of the places he has been. It is exactly as it shows in the picture. Perfect size and everything. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the edges had a few small tears and the map was slightly wrinkled on one end. He was a little sad about it but we are going to mount the map to some cardboard or something so he can stick pins in it so hopefully I can fix these little things for him.,4.0
"This US map arrives rolled in a tube on heavy duty glossy paper.  It is not laminated, but looks good on a wall.  It does not reflect bright lights like a laminated map would.  The detail of this map is excellent.  I especially like the map insert showing Alaska superimposed over the continental US showing how huge Alaska really is.  It stretches from Florida to Minnesota to California!  Yikes!  I got a box of push pins and started putting them in places where I have been.  Turns out I've been to a lot of places!  This is a great map!  Get one...",4.0
"This large map from NatGeo is printed on very nice stock, priced right and sent in a tube, so it can be dry-mounted and framed.  Be sure you check out the size, because it may be a bit large for hanging in some rooms.",4.0
"Searching for a map of the USA that would be large enough to id specific areas with small tags or pins, but would not cost a fortune, I was extremely relieved when I found this map on Amazon. Local office supply stores did not have anything close for less than $ 100+. Intent to keep the map after the project is finished since it is great for getting a proper perspective on the distances and locations of places.",4.0
"Came in a plastic tube. Very good!
But there were some damages / edges of the map.
Overall I think it was a good choice",4.0
"Decent quality paper map that came well packaged and in good condition.  Not quite as much detail with roads as I had hoped, but is adequate for mapping vacation trips.",4.0
"This map is great for a wall map and has good detail with many smaller than expected towns (<40,000) shown, for a complete US map. The only think I would recommend is ordering one that is laminated if you plan to have it covered because we had to call around to every place in town before we found the only one that had a machine large enough to laminate it.",4.0
This is a very large and detailed map. The quality of the paper is fairly cheap so it's not very durable but other than that the map is great for wall decor.,4.0
"I don't know what I was thinking... This is almost the size of a full wall mural.  Good product, laminated, and withstood the brunt of United Parcel's best intentions to destroy it.  This is not a show piece, it is more industrial.",4.0
"The map is great with nice colors and it arrived super fast. My only complaint is that the one corner has a slight bubble under the lamination. I only noticed when it was laying flat on the ground so it's not a huge deal. And they would probably give me another one if I returned it, but I'd rather not go to the hassle.
Great map nonetheless.",4.0
Great.,4.0
"This was a great map and very well-made. For some reason, it had the eastern continents on the left (Africa, Asia), and the western continents on the right (America's). I understand it's not geographically inaccurate, but I suppose I am just used to looking at maps with it being reversed since grade school. Good purchase!",4.0
NOT LAMINATED!! Multiple reviews state that this map is laminated but it is NOT laminated. Otherwise it is a great and very detailed map.,4.0
Wanted a U.S. map for the man cave wall and this looks great. It's very detailed and for the price I think it's a good deal.,4.0
"The colors are excellent and there are a good amount of cities listed.  I'm using it on a wall in my den to glance at if someone mentions where they live.  I'm only giving a star off because the lamination is so thin. However, maybe that's good because so far I just have it stuck up with scotch tape.",4.0
"This is good as a piece of art on the wall.  The details are limited - which makes sense.  I was looking for something that would drill down further to show me places like Rexburg Idaho, Mammoth Lakes, Wrightwood... smaller towns.  There is only so much room.

Great size and looks perfect in my office.,4.0
Looks good and good price,4.0
I mounted it  and a bulletin board we are sticking pins in to the places we have been on vacation.. we want to hit all the states for at least a week to count,4.0
"I certainly can't say this is the best map in the world but for the price it is great. Someone had mentioned dull color but I do not see an issue with the color of this map and I believe it is pretty accurately displayed on my computer screen. The lamination serves its purpose as a thin protector. This map also has more detail than the previous one I had, which displayed Fairbanks as the only city in Alaska. I also like the road numbers.
The only thing I had an issue with was the size. I thought it was 2ft x 3ft but it ended up being more like 20 inches by 32 inches.",4.0
Very detailed map! I could spend minutes at a time just searching out capitals and looking at all the island chains they include.,4.0
"The detail and quality are very good, for me personally I wish that it could be a little bigger for even more detail.",4.0
"Gorgeous map very detailed.  Just two issues both which are minor.  First, the National Geographic logo right in the middle bottom is a bit distracting.  Lastly, it's hard to find a large enough quality frame without spending over $200.",4.0
great for topography. some stronger contrast of colors among states would be okay,4.0
"I didn't think though... still don't know how to ""frame"" it...",4.0
little wrinkled,4.0
"The description says it is 2032"". The printed area is actually 20.532"". Including the laminate edge, the total size is 32.75x21.25""...too big for a 2032"" frame unless you cut it. Mine was also dented in the package, making creases every 3"" across the map's entirety. I already got my refund.",4.0
Great map.  Nice large size.  Great detail.  I wish the laminating were a bit thicker.  Great map to use for educational purposes.,4.0
"Great map, construction is reasonable but did not exceed expectations. Worked perfectly for the project I used it for. Used along with a custom build frame and frontlit with recessed LED's. Backed with insulation and ended up pretty nice for the wife to pin!",4.0
Yup. It's a map.,4.0
Beautiful map! I get lots of compliments.,4.0
We used this map to show family and friends our epic journey across Canada and the US this summer and had a number of people remark on the quality of this little map.  Always felt fragile in the hands but handle it with care and you'll be fine.,4.0
Good strength to the laminate and a clean and easy to read map without it being huge,4.0
"Great map for what I'm using is for - trips taken.  As other reviews have said, the dark colors are a negative.",4.0
"I wanted a map to frame and hang in my living room. I like being able to reference places on the news as well as having a reference for conversations that involve traveling. (For some reason I have those conversations a lot.) But I also wanted something that DIDN'T look like it belongs in a 5th-grade social studies classroom. This map is perfect for that. It's very pleasing to the eye and feels more like a ""grown up"" map than most of the ones I've seen that use different solid colors to separate the states. It's also very nice to have the bordering parts of Canada and Mexico visible.

The level of detail is very nice. I've lived in a few very small towns and most of them are actually listed on this map! The font choice is excellent as well.

I will agree with another reviewer who said that it's somewhat difficult to find or follow the names of mountain ranges. That's really my only knock against it. To be fair though, there's only so much room, and I personally care more about being able to read the roads, towns, lakes and state names than the mountain ranges.",4.0
I like the detail and coloration if this map. It is also sturdy and nicely laminated. A good value and presentation.,4.0
"just what I need it, good size",4.0
Its a map. It works as a map should.,4.0
"looks good.  a little thin, on the unsubstantial side but thus far no problems with it",4.0
"Map was printed on thin paper but laminated.  We glued it to a foam board for better stiffness.  The coloring of the states is a bit boring and the emphasis on showing interstates so boldly was an odd design decision.  However, we wanted a map to use for pinning vacation spots etc so it suits our purpose",4.0
Map was just as pictured.  Only complaint is one corner was mangled some.,4.0
"Awesome purchase, but the size is overwelming and definately not cheap if you plan on framing it. The color and print on it is great and legible.",4.0
It's a really nice map. Although I got one that was messed up a bit at the end. I'm assuming from the cap of the lid being stuck on without care. For my purposes (planning a logical geographic trip to Europe) its not a big deal as I will be sticking pins in it. And a frame would probably cover it if I was doing that.,4.0
Exactly what I was looking for,4.0
Worked well.  I think I need a larger map. Doing some ancestral search and need more detail.,4.0
"The only thing I wish it had was more contrast. I purchased it in hopes that my husband, who has macular degeneration,  could see the new boundaries as the USSR changed.  This is still a beautiful map.",4.0

"This map was purchased to replace a map I had give my son in 2003. The original map was destroyed in a house fire last Feb. My son was badly hurt so his ""things"" were of no concern early on. He made an incredible come back, he's back into a new place. He's fully recovered and he's back to work. In his recovery journey he is now rebuilding. That map I had given him so many years ago turned out to be something he missed. He asked for replacement and since the map was given to me prior to my giving it to my son, IDK where it originated. I came to Amazon first, saw this map, and from what I could see it looked the same. My son said it's smaller than the original one and didn't include the smaller cities but was otherwise very similar. He was happy and sent me a photo of it on his wall. This is a prime example of how the smaller things in life can truly matter. Thanks for reading if  got this far.",4.0
"I bought this map to mark my travels across Europe with push pins. My plan was to mount this laminated map on a cork board and place it on the wall of my study along with a U.S map used for the same purpose. The plan worked out well.  The map's scale, while not as detailed as I would have liked, is perfect for allowing me to outline the major features of my European travels.  The next size up would have been far too large so I settled for this one.  The lamination is stiff enough to keep the map rigid, and thin enough to allow a small-guage push pin to pass through the map and securely into the cork board. I highly recommend this series of maps for those seeking to complete a project like mine.  The next larger size would make it easier for those who wish to plan a trip to both large cities and medium sized towns, or for classroom reference.",4.0
I ordered this map to help track where we want to travel while in Europe.  We hung it in our office and it looks great!  The laminate helps protect it and allows us to use dry-erase markers.  I would highly recommend this map for anyone interested in Europe and want a map that looks great on the wall.,4.0
"Once again, National Geographic did not disappointment me.  This map is so cool!  I love the detail and coloring.  I really like the fact that NG did not make the ocean and seas blue.  Definitely Executive Style!",4.0
"The reason I'm giving this map 4 stars vs 5 is that I wish it had come laminated. That is its' one and only downfall! Other than that, it's perfect for us documenting our travels across Europe!!",4.0
"The map is nice, maybe a little high priced but it does have a ""executive"" look to it. My only complaint is about the packaging. The map was rolled up in the manufacturer packaging, but when Amazon packed it in the shipping box they stuffed paper filler in the box and crushed the laminated map. Unrolled the map has noticeable crinkles in it. This was ordered last minute for a gift so no time to return it.",4.0
It's really big. I want to frame it but will need to find an economical way to do it myself because Michael's quoted me 300-600 dollars!,4.0
good,4.0
"it's fine, but because of small typing it's a little hard to read.",4.0
"Very durable, clear, readable, and I like the easy-to-see geographical features.",4.0
"Used Modj Podj (spelling??) to glue this to a cork board (from walmart). I bought this map because the size of the map matched the size of the board. I ended up having to cut an inch from the top and bottom of the map to make it fit on the board. I am disappointed to have lost the decorative outline of the map.  I did not measure either product, the board or the map so I'm not sure which one was off - either the board was small or the map was slightly larger than advertised.",4.0
"Looks good in my office. My only complaint is that it is almost impossible to get this thing to lay flat, I hung it in my wall and had to use pushpins instead of poster tape because of the permanent curl.",4.0
I am using dry erase pens to plan trips on this laminated map.  It's perfect for that.  I am happy with this purchase.,4.0
Has most major highways and cities. I used it to push pin all the cities that I've traveled to over the years. It's good for that.,4.0
"I like this quite a bit. It is so detailed. That is also part of the reason I give 4/5, It is difficult to make out the names of the larger things (Mountain Ranges, ""United States"" ""Canada"" ""Mexico"")... difficult to make it out just because there are so damn many city names on this. It is amazing though, it shows contour lines and the states are different colors. So many cities are listed though, it is kind of overwhelming.",4.0
"Perfect for what I needed (a map for folks at my wedding to mark their hometown). Great colors, National Geographic, high quality.",4.0
"I was able to get a custom frame made very cheaply, and we hung it up in our travel-themed bar.  Once we unrolled it and laid some heavy books over it for the night, it stayed fairly flat and fit into the frame easily.  My wife and I have been using map pins to mark all of the places we've traveled since being married.  If you're using it as a study tool that you frequently roll up and put away, you might have a problem with it laying flat.  For the U.S. and Canada section of the map the states and territories are labelled as well as capitals and other big cities.  For the rest of the world the countries, capitals, and big cities are labelled.",4.0
"I researched for a long time and settled on this map for two reasons:

1) I like the projection. It uses the Winkel-Tripel projection, which is a fair compromise between accurate distances and accurate shapes. The one you see on Google Maps is the Mercator projection, which heavily distorts distances towards the top and bottom edges of the map. That said, no projection is perfect (you're mapping a sphere onto a rectangle -- there is no perfect conversion!), and I like what Nat Geo has chosen.

2) It has a lot of information like city names and the four other maps at the corners. The population density one in particular provides a nice view of where are the population-dense areas. One problem might be that having so much data makes it a little hard to get a clear glimpse of country locations. On simpler maps, you have mostly just country name, so at a glance you can figure out who are neighbors and such. Central Europe here is packed with so many city names that it's hard to figure out who's where.

Upon opening the map (which was wrapped in plastic and came in a nice elongated cuboid), my immediate problem was how fragile the lamination is. Unlike some maps I've had, the lamination here is very thin and I immediately wind up with some fold lines, which are very obvious at the edges of the map. Granted, I may have been a little clumsy. But you need to adjust your expectations and be exceptionally careful when handling the map.

The map is very well-priced though, IMO, and it's hard to find other good maps at this price. I would buy this again but unwrap it with more care.",4.0
"I bought this to track my various road trips around the country, and it did not disappoint! It is large enough to differentiate between the various routes you might take going cross country yet detailed enough to plot my specific trips on the major roads. I don't have too many specific positives, however this map was exactly what I expected (a laminated map of the US) and allows me to plot my various trips through the country with ease and accuracy. If you are looking for more than this you may want to look elsewhere, but this suited my needs perfectly! Definitely recommended!",4.0
We got this to pin where we have been. It appears to be of good quality. Looking forward to adding a lot of pins.,4.0

I returned it because it was an order I made by mistake...so I didn't even open it. But I'm sure it was a great map!,4.0
"The map was a good size for my wall.  The laminating is great for dry erase pens or other markers.  I use it to plan my motorcycle trips and would like a little more detail but to get a map with all the back roads on it, it would be big enough to fill a room.
It came rolled up in a box.  No damage but had to lay it out flat for a few days to help get the roll out of it.  I would recommend this map for any kind of road trip planning!",4.0

"It's, in general, a beautiful map. Except the pixelated background in the ocean. Otherwise, the printing is decent (especially for the size and price), and it's LARGE (make sure you understand the product dimensions).
I personally have been wanting a map this large for a while, so I was pleased to see it for only $30. Add a homemade frame (you're probably not gonna buy a frame for something this large that costs so little), and a thin sheet of plexi...it's gorgeous.",4.0

"Needed a map to track all of the places I've been in my travels this past year, and for this year and places I'd like to go - this is a perfect map that has all the major cities and just what I was looking for.
What I didn't like was the packaging or the way it was rolled up from source - it was bent and creased and it took a bit to get them out before posting on board. Warmed it up with a little steam from the iron - DO NOT RECOMMEND UNLESS YOU HAVE PRACTICE WITH THIS SORT OF THING! Sometimes a damp cloth microwaved for 10-15secs works too and is safer :)
So change the
Other than that it's what I needed.",4.0
"The map is well made and covered with plastic.  It gives solid basic information and therefore is a great source to go to when questions pop up.  You can write on it too, and with the right type of pen, it can be wiped off later.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys maps.",4.0

It was out of stock, and indicated that I would be notified when shipped, and it still said as such on the website when the map showed up at my door (which was a pleasant surprise).  The packaging was damaged, and the map and tube bent, but after working out the kinks in it I've gotten most of the wrinkling out of it.

The product itself is beautiful, and I absolutely love it.  I would highly recommend the map itself, and that the seller should simply package and notify of availability a bit better.",4.0

This map was exactly what I expected. I'm studying for the FSOT and I need a world map to help with geography and capitals. The map arrived in a box that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift. The plastic tube that encased my map had to be cut off. Luckily there was little damage to the map other than a few creases. All in all I'm happy.,4.0
The map came through amazon in a big box with lots of packing so there wasn't a dent on it. The map itself is very nicely laminated. Since we are a military family I bought it to help my daughter understand that all of our family live in different places and sometimes daddy is on the other side of the world. The lamination allows us to put pictures of family near there locations and move them around when need be. Wish the land areas were a little bigger but no big deal. It serves its purpose well.,4.0

"After this publication hit shelves, it was brought to my attention that one of my sites, The CHINformation Organization Forum ([...] had been listed as a web resource. I was honored, but a bit apprehensive, knowing that most books contain incorrect and even dangerous information regarding chinchillas. Promotions of the site are great, but I did not want to be associated with a publication that had the potential of doing more harm than good.  I purchased the book and read it cover to cover and was very pleasantly surprised!  It could stand to have better pictures of chinchillas, since most of the chins pictured are less than ideal, and it states that introducing adult females is easier than introducing adult males, which I tend to disagree with, but it's over-all pretty well written.  I would recommend this book in addition to lots and lots of online research to prospective chinchilla owners.",4.0

Nice book and age appropriate. Easy for bright child who is interested in science to follow. Bought for my granddaughter as part of her Christmas to go with a microscope and slides.

"Please note that this 2008 reprint is identical in every way to the 1989 version of the same title. So, if you are looking for more reviews, everything you see said about the ""white cover"" World of the Microscope applies here as well.
I loved microscopes in school and have envied our science classes for years whenever the microscope unit came around, so I finally got myself some scopes (compound and stereo) about 18 months ago, along with nearly all the supplies I thought I might need (was confused on the dyes that would be helpful, so only picked up methylene blue as it was so easy to obtain).  Alas, without a teacher to do the preparations for me, I found myself a little at a loss as to how to make my own slides. The Internet helped a bit, but I wasn't very successful with my first efforts and put my microscopes aside with some regret and a vague hope of working things out later.
Then recently I came across the 1989 edition of this book in our library and had a look through it.  Almost at once I decided that it might fill in some of the gaps in my knowledge (like how to properly use that hand microtome I bought!).  Parts of the book are of no interest to me (e.g., who uses microscopes or how they work, the types of scopes and their parts, etc.), but the novice level information on stains, making sections, preparing various projects for viewing, culturing bacteria, and so on looks like it's just what I need.  And yes, there was definitely good information about using a microtome (including how I could have saved money by making my own from scratch).  Sure, all of this has got to be scattered around online, but I'm a book person, happy to have it all in one place and in reach when I want it (which is why I bought my own copy after the library one looked good to me).
In conclusion, it's always a risk to write a review before fully using the item in question, but from the point of view of a would-be microscopist looking for a starting point, I expect to be very satisfied with this book, and believe others in my position might like it as well.  Oh, and yes, it's definitely made for the children's market, not aimed at adults, but for my needs that's not an issue (and is maybe even a plus, as they don't assume knowledge the reader may not have).",4.0
My granddaughters stated it was very helpful. It made the microscope more fun to use and learn. Good addition for them.,4.0
Microscope (not a toy) recently purchased for 6-year-old to use now and through next few school years.  This book probably not normally good for this age child--too advanced.  You will need to check book out to see if it is good for your child's age or reading ability.,4.0
Great Illustrations and teaches everything you could need to know about learning to use a microscope. Bought for a 3rd grader and spot on skill level wise!,4.0
This is a good book for anyone wanting to learn the basics of working with a microscope and microscope slides. I liked it.,4.0
"I looked it over and it was a great companion to the microscope I
bought for my grandaughter for her birthday",4.0
We bought this to go with our new microscope. There are beautiful illustrations and lots of information in the book.,4.0
T;his was a gift for a teenage granddaughter. I hear she was able to get started exploring the power of a microscope with the help of an aunt.,4.0
"I'm a biology professor, and I teach microscopy. There are experiments in this book that I didn't even know about. My nephew and I are gonna have soooo much fun. I can't wait to share this with him and work with his new microscope. This is waaaay better than buying kids pointless games. Learning is food for the brain and it's better to start them while they're young.",4.0
"I have always used these certificates, not only because they are beautiful but affordable with prompt service.  I highly recommend them for those in need of an attractive certificate.",4.0
We had trouble finding the right envelopes and these fit the bill very well!  Very usable.  They are a good value too.,4.0
"I ordered these envelopes although unsure of what to suspect.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the envelopes which adequately captures all of the categories for tithing and sowing special seed offerings.",4.0
These are great offering envelope to use. I have been using them for over 3 years and it is a good product.,4.0
"The Bad Girl's Power Planner was exactly what I was hoping it would be.  Small enough to take with me wherever I go, very pink (an attention grabber amongst all my friends...I'm quite sure I've inspired many of them to go purchase it as well), and cute little girly sketches throughout to remind me of things like what Fridays are really for (not for plopping onto the couch with exhaustion and tossing in a movie that I can fall asleep to!) It has a weekly planner, a space for phone numbers and addresses, note paper and ""to-do lists"", everything a planner should have, but stylish as well!",4.0
"mom wanted a phone book just a simple phone book and could not find one at a decent price. so once again amazon comes through... i found a nice little pretty and simple phone book, just what mom wanted and it looks so nice on her desk",4.0
"It is absolutely adorable, but I somehow missed how small it was when I bought it. I thought it was regular address book sized so I was just short of stunned when I opened it. (What did they shrink this sucker in the wash?) But I am totally happy with it because actually, I can fit this in my purse! I do think I would have preferred it to be full size though, because then I would have been less likely to lose it and I am still wary of that. I counted the sections and it looks like you can fit 15 names per letter of the alphabet I think. I might be wrong, but I think that's what I counted.",4.0
Smaller than expected.,4.0
"After reading other reviews and the dimensions of this Cath Kidston Address Book I decided it was what I wanted and ordered it from Amazon.  So far it has not disappointed!

Yes, it is small, but I wanted it that way so that it was portable and I could throw it in my purse occasionally if I needed to.

The different designs and colors are beautiful!  It opens nicely and the binding seems to be durable.  The only thing I have found that I wish was different was certain sections have a flower or fruit design directly next to the name and address lines.  This actually takes away a portion of the lines, making them shorter so you don't have quite as much room to write longer names and addresses (for instance the letters A, C, E, L and T sections).  Other than that, I am very happy and think it is a great ptoduct, especially for the price!",4.0
good for car and purse very pretty and useful ..  a nice gift also. have it for a long time now.,4.0
"Purchased because it was pretty and because I lost my old one I'd had forever. My old one had spiral binding and I much prefer that, but this one was so pretty..... we'll see how long it lasts.",4.0
"the book is not hardbound but seems very durable. The pages have plenty of space for addressess, phone numbers and e-mails.
The pages are colorful and there is a place for notes and birthdates. It fits great in my purse.",4.0
I should  have looked at the size...it's a bit small for all the information I was needing to record....but it is okay - nice - product is made good and the service of getting it was great -,4.0
"Given as a christmas gift to a friend.  She loved it, the size was great since she doesn't like a huge address book.  We both liked the fact that there were only three info spots on each page, much easier to read and to fill in.",4.0
My old address book is all crossed out and big. This is just the perfect size. I can even carry it with me on trips!,4.0
"I purchased this for my Mom as she has vision issues. I was able to large print all her address in, with space to spare.",4.0
"My friend, a soon to be bride, loves the address book. It was just the right size for her.  Great product.",4.0
"I love the look and size of this address book, but am not crazy about the alphabetic tabs, which I believe will get a little worn over the years.",4.0
"Great product, better than some of it's competitor's versions, practical, esthetic and very good quality. A must.",4.0
This is an amazingly entertaining and useful book. Why has it taken so long for someone to pull all of this together .WOW !,4.0
"I really think the planner could be a bit bigger, but other than that, I'm really happy with the purchase. As a college student, I do have quite a bit of work to do everyday and three small lines for each class doesn't always cut it. I really wanted something where I could see the whole week easier and this planner really allows for that, which is the reason I purchased it. I also really love the stickers because it makes it a bit easier to look ahead at test dates and helps me pay attention to what weeks I really need to study and whatnot.",4.0
"I purchsed this for my daughter to keep organized during the school year. She LOVES this planner. I filled in the months & dates on the pages for her, and was bummed to discover it didn't contain enough pages for the entire school year (Aug 24-June 4). I was 3 weeks short :-(
Maybe I should have left out the week of Christmas & Spring Break.
Overall it's still a great item to keep my daughter organized, and she's very happy with it, so I can't complain.",4.0
These books are fantastic but unfortunately the was a printing error in one and 4 pages were blank!,4.0
Always use these sets in my Montessori classroom,4.0
"My daughter attends Montessori and I wanted to do additional work at home with her reading.  These books are perfect for her (she's 4.5).  They are slightly challenging, but give her enough confidence that she wants to read them.",4.0
arrived ok,4.0
Happy with poster. We laminated to increase the durability for long-term use. I gave it 4 instead of 5 not because of the quality but because it is hard to gauge which age group it is best suited for. Pictures are very appropriate for early childhood but captions and descriptions are more upper elementary. But it is a very good product with great activity suggestions for teachers on the back.,4.0
good,4.0
Great teaching lesson for kids,4.0
"I love the way the 10 Commandments is in a language that kids can relate to. I would have liked it slightly bigger, but it looks great in our home school room.",4.0
"This is great for kids in a language they can understand.  It is colorful and eye-catching, with activities on the back that would keep kids' interests.",4.0
"Great poster.  It evokes a lot of questions and answers a lot of questions.  It is going up in our ""Hallway of Science"".",4.0
"Although I like this poster, I wish it was more explanatory. I will figure this out on my own as I want to teach my son about the phases of the moon.",4.0
It's very useful for my students!,4.0
These were nice Easter egg fillers. I just wish they had a little more space between stickers to cut.,4.0
Cute. bought it for our church's sunday school,4.0
nice to use with a group of students,4.0
"I like this book, but for being at the 3/4 grade level it seems really pretty tough at times.  I have used it before and will continue using it.  I'm using it with sixth graders that are English Language Learners.",4.0
"For all those FS bush pilots out there, flying in Alaska, this is a 'must have' publication. The only 'issue' I have with it is the paperback binding, making it a bit difficult to lay flat on the desk. Essential for learning the environment and for VFR flying on your PC. And... fo course.. if you plan a trip to Alaska for real, this too is one to study beforehand ! Been using it for years now and can highly recommend it.",4.0
"This atlas appeared as a ""recommended item"" for me by Amazon.com. I noticed I had a dog-eared, rumpled copy next to my chair and thought I'd give it an honest review.

First of all, what it ISN'T. The topographic maps certainly don't contain ""unbeatable detail."" For example, right now I'm planning a trip in the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. In that area of the state, the map scale is 1:1,400,000, where 1 inch represents about 22 miles! Not much detail available on that scale.

The regions most people are traveling in, however, are on a much more detailed scale of 1:300,000, where 1 inch = 4.8 miles.

These maps cover the areas where most people live and hunt and fish and backpack and boat in Alaska. (For comparison, the most commonly used topographic maps obtained elsewhere are at a scale of 1:24:000 for most of the U.S. and 1:63,360 for Alaska.)

The Atlas IS an invaluable reference for planning and quick reference. I try to keep mine handy, and reference it very often. It is much, much faster and easier than trying to download or find individual topo maps.

There's a very handy map index on the back, showing each map's page and area. On the second page there's a two page fold-out relief map, in color, showing Alaska's mountain ranges, rivers, etc. There's a map legend inside the front cover, and a Table of Contents on page one, and the back. There are other interesting and useful features like the average temperatures and daylight hours from Nome to Anchorage to Juneau.

This Atlas is similar to a compact camera: it may not have quite as many features, but it's handiness often makes it even more useful.",4.0
can locate all the tiny settlements shown on tv.  Just wish it was spiral bound. large enough to see good detail.,4.0
I'm just now going over the maps and making our trip planner so far it looks good and is probably the best information we have received,4.0
Wish it was laid out like the Maine Delorme - confusing when you need to go back and forth. otherwise is great for exploring.,4.0
Another great product from Delorme. The only thing i wish was better is to be able to identify road classes. There are many roads in the maps that are private and class 4 (not maintained in the winter). Would be nice to know...,4.0
As advertised & price was right.,4.0
"If you are planning a trip to Alaska, this is a must!",4.0
good map,4.0
"I love my GPS, but also like to have a ""real"" map in the car. The bonus is having the campgrounds etc. clearly marked. Great price on Amazon.",4.0
"reading a lot about Alaska, fiction and nonfiction, lot of history; map book very useful",4.0
Used it a little but the Milepost was a better purchase,4.0
"Delorme is my favorite map company...they just do it right.  Easy to read, A must have in places where the ""city"" maps don't go...dirt roads, trails, etc....Delorme does it better, not perfect, but better",4.0
"Very usefull and detailed atlas. To my knowledge it is the only complete alaskan map with a whole bundle of information. It comes with information of camping sites, description of major trails and road mileadge... In addition most maps are at a quite low scale such as 300 000.",4.0
"The gazetter of Alaska does not have the same level of detail I have come to expect from DeLorme.  I am sure this is due to the sheer szie of Alaska.  We used in conjuction with the Milepost book for our 1st visit to Alaska and found using them together worked fantastic.  Of note: There are not a lot of roads in Alaska (there is usually only 1 way to get somewhere) and it is almost impossible to get lost as there is clear signage for towns, parks, and points of interest.",4.0
Good start for your Alaska trip for sure.  Use it to look at the areas you want to go and get some more detailed maps of that specific region from the government.  Alaska is huge and this does a good job of giving a fairly detailed map book that you can carry around.,4.0
i have  this for the gps grids and you get some ideal what the roads might be like for a driving trip in Alaska,4.0
I am planning a 3 month trip next summer and will use this as we travel along.  The Alaska Atlas will be well used on our trip.,4.0
This is a gift for a friend who has never driven to Alaska.  We received one 14 years ago for our first trip and it was fun/helpful on the drive.,4.0
"Every Alaska household that's into the outdoors has at least one copy of this book. As someone who operates a popular Alaska travel website (Alaska.org) and helps people plan custom Alaska vacations, I often recommend this book to visitors taking a driving tour.

For $20, you get basically the entire set of USGS topographic maps for the state of Alaska, most at the 1:300,000 scale (1 inch = 4.8 miles). When the book first came out in the 1990's, it broke my heart, because I had just purchased the equivalent Alaska map set from the USGS, each on individual sheets, for $500!

I keep one in my car while driving Alaska's highways, so wherever I go, I'll know the names of the mountains, rivers, and main features. The maps are also detailed enough to use as a reference if you want to take a day hike or backpacking trip.

However, if you plan any kind of multi-day adventure into a specific area, you'll want to instead get at least the USGS quadrangle for that area (available at the Anchorage USGS office at Alaska Pacific University). At a 1:250,000 (1 inch = 3.9 miles) scale, the quads are somewhat more detailed and easy to fold up and carry. If you're not an Alaska backcountry expert, you might also consider picking up the even more detailed 1:25,000 scale (1 inch = .4 mile) maps for your intended route. Each map is $4.00-$6.00.

So, the value of this book is basically being able to research any part of Alaska. For example, if you're calling an air taxi to discuss pickup or dropoff locations, you can just flip to the right page in the Atlas and know what they're referring to. If you're planning a float or backpacking trip, the Atlas can help you gauge the difficulty of the terrain and estimated travel time. If you're planning a road trip, the Atlas is great for planning out where you'll see the most rugged topography and where streams and creeks cross the road (for water or car camping).

If you're planning an extended road trip in Alaska or the Yukon, you'll also want to get the Milepost. Unlike the Atlas, the Milepost does not contain detailed topographic maps but instead mostly text listings of what to see and do at each milepoint. If you're mainly traveling between Seward, Denali, and Fairbanks (the central part of Alaska known as ""the Railbelt""), avoid the expense of the Milepost and instead pick up the free, 120-page Alaska Activities Guide available at hotels and car rental locations throughout Anchorage. It contains a couple dozen maps and excellent commentary. You can download some of those maps at Alaska.org/maps, as well as a fairly good State of Alaska Map.

The Atlas is easy to use. There's a large index map on the first page and a nice two-page foldout map of the entire state as well. It also contains some nice reference tables of freshwater and saltwater fishing locations, boat ramps, mountain ranges, wildlife refuges, and other information--though none of these tables are detailed enough to be a standalone trip planning resource.

My main criticism of the Atlas is that huge sections of northern (north of Livengood) and western Alaska (west of McGrath) are at the unfortunate 1:1,400,000 scale (1 inch = 22 miles). I understand that few people visit these regions, but they are at a scale so general as to be almost useless, and the labeling is sparse. If you're planning a trip to the Brooks Range, the rivers of Western Alaska, the Haul Road, or other more remote parts of the state, these 1:1,400,000 maps don't help much.",4.0
"Other than the fact that the scale is way to small at 1:250,000 this is a valuable resource that is very useful.  I carry one of these for every location that I go.
Go idea to tape the pages because the stable binding falls apart with use",4.0
"We were on a driving trip in Alaska and wanted a map with details about the terrain as well as roads. This altas fits the bill. Our only complaint is that almost everyone in Alaska uses ""milepost"" numbers on the main highways as landmarks and even their street address in some places, and those reference points are not included along the roads on the maps. Even so, it was a big help for our trip.",4.0
"The sheer size of Alaska tends to defeat what would otherwise be an unbeatable map collection for most states in the lower 48.  A second challenge is the very thin transportation infrastructure in Alaska; huge areas of the state are not on the limited road network and can be reached in a timely manner only by air.  Enormous swaths of wilderness have no transportation network at all.

The DeLorme ""Alaska Atlas and Gazetteer"" is an excellent resource for trip planning.  Used in conjunction with the most recent ""Milepost"", the average travelor can reach any point in the state accessible by road and plan entry into many other areas.  However, the scale of the maps is insufficient for detailed off-road route planning; deep country hikers, hunters, and fishermen are advised to seek more specialized map products.

This Atlas is highly recommended to the traveler in Alaska looking for a compact map resource. It is also a good starting point for planning trips in determining where more detailed map products will be needed.",4.0
yes we like it,4.0
"January's pic is painted, otherwise I'm happy",4.0
"This book is a good for beginner artist and people who want to learn more about how to correctly draw perspective. For the price of the book you are getting a great deal of information about 2 point, 3 point perspective. I ordered this book for my college level class just to better understand perspective and it has taught me a lot that I have forgotten. I recommend this book to any artist who has had trouble with perspective and wants a inexpensive book to teach them that.",4.0
"This was the first perspective book I went through where I actually ""got"" perspective. It clearly illustrates the principles in a concise and easy-to-read manner.",4.0
"I had to use this book in one of my first drawing classes for college. The ease and depth which the topic of perspective is presented is easy enough to understand but, very useful for learning the proper art of perspective. I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn this fundamental principle that is perspective.",4.0
"I really like this little book. I'm a nut about perspective, and this cheap little paperback clearly teaches you everything you need to know about perspective for most uses. It's definitely not very in-depth, but if you just want to quickly learn the basics, this is the book you want.",4.0
"So far so good, I am only a student taking a class, you will have to look for real artistic types to judge the content. But it is written in plain language and useful illustration.",4.0
"Short and to the point, makes perspective easy to understand and lots of images to help you understand and whatnot.",4.0
Great book. That is all. Buy it.,4.0
"In general a very straight forward book to have in order to learn perspective drawing. It gives step by step on how to execute different types of perspective (one point, two point, so on) as well as goes over on things such as how to create repeating windows in perspective or fences, so on. Not much to say other than it is a useful book for beginners first learning these types of concepts.

One issue I have is to beware of is that this listing unfortunately contains different versions of this book. I had purchased this used and got a much older version than the one showcased. The newer version has been changed and doesn't completely match the older versions (as they omitted, added, moved around certain pages), so beware when you are thinking about buying this.",4.0
"Good book for basic perspective, explained clearly for the most part. Useful for artists, architectural staff. Easy reading, not too complicated, with short exercises to practice what is learned.",4.0
"My art teacher had this book and I wanted to have my own copy.  I'm just beginning, but I find perspective very interesting.  I like how the book laid out.  It is a well written text.",4.0

"I am a homeschool mom of 6.  I needed a grammar program that would be comprehensive without being boring and frustrating for my ""I hate writing"" child.  This fits the bill.",4.0
"Nice, simple book. Fun to fill in and remember as you go! it prompts you to write things you may have forgotten or not thought of in a long time. Lots of room to write what you want towards the end, so nothing is missed.",4.0
"This is my 3rd BusyBodyBook, and they keep getting better.  I love the 5 columns, which allow you to keep track of all family member's schedules and the boxes are large enough to write down all your information.  I keep it at my desk at home.  A smaller, companion book would be great for taking with you.",4.0
"I got this for my grandson who has to read for 20 minutes a day, as required by his teacher. This is perfect for him as the timer lets him keep track of the time and ensures he will read the entire 20 minutes. However, it is a little bulky for children's books, making it hard for him to use as a bookmark.",4.0
easy to use. My 3rd grader can time himself and keep track of his reading for class.,4.0
My son really likes this to time his reading. However I ordered the blue one & received purple. Thankfully my son didn't care but it was kind of a bummer.,4.0
"Love that my LO can set the timer and when it goes off, he wants to keep reading!",4.0
Daughter loves this for timing her reading homework. No instructions so took some figuring out/ trial and error to learn how it works.,4.0
"It's cool, my daughter wanted one. A little confusing at first to operate and get going, but overall a good buy. Mix it up on designs would be cool...",4.0
"Works well.  My 9 & 12 year olds don't always know how to work the timer though.  They threw away the directions so can't look there.  Also, the battery life isn't super long.",4.0
Very good although the battery life is not great.,4.0
My kids have to read a certain number of minutes each night for school.  They are able to pause it if they need to stop for something and then pick up the timing where they left off. We have not had any issues with it and it puts them in charge of timing themselves. We are happy with the purchase.,4.0
"It works, but we ordered red and it came pink.",4.0
"Great item, but the color sent was purple, not blue.  Luckily, it's dark purple and so not a big deal for my son.",4.0
Useful for tracking reading in bed for my 8 year old,4.0
Gave this to granddaughters for Christmas......I think they liked them.,4.0
Great bookmark!  My child loves using it for her reading homework.  She also loves the purple color she got.,4.0
My child love it. Took it to school to show all his friends.,4.0
The only reason I gave it 4 starts is because you can't pick your color. I got this for my son who is 8 and ended up with a pink one..... :(,4.0
Works OK but a little hevay for in the books.,4.0
A bit confusing but once you figure out it is great.,4.0
My children have to read every night for homework & log their minutes.  This makes it so easy.  Does seem like it is made a bit cheap but it was inexpensive so I will see how it holds up.,4.0
"Just got it but over the last few days it's been a constant report out of how many minutes read.  Seems to have inspired a bit of ""beat my best time"" motivation!",4.0
"This bookmark does what it is supposed to do. As part of my son's homework, he is required to read for a certain amount of time every night. He used to use the microwave or stove for a timer. That turned into somewhat of an inconvenience around dinner time as the stove and sometimes the microwave were needed for dinner prep. It is easy to use. It counts up and it counts down. We'll see how long it lasts.",4.0
"I have one child who is a reluctant reader. Her school asks that kids read for 20 minutes every day, and this gives her autonomy over the process- and makes it fun. Mine broke after 6 months and the company replaced for free and even set it to our time zone!! Now that's amazing customer service!",4.0
"From my daughter: It saves your place in the book, you can time yourself, you don't have to look at another timer and get distracted because the timer is in front of you.",4.0
love it but a bit difficult for my kids to use.,4.0
"I purchased one prior from B&N that had a built in light. Ordered this one in a different color, but failed to notice it didn't have a reading light. We love these markers because of the timer feature. I can tell the kids to go read for an hour, and they set the timer to count down 60 minutes. Or, when we have to document nightly reading, we cab set the timer to count up... when they finish the book, they stop the timer.

Construction is well made and durable.",4.0
This item is so nifty.  It's perfect for counting down those 20 minutes of daily reading.,4.0
I do wish it had an option for minutes and seconds.  My 9 year old has to read a small book for school each week that is only a couple minutes long and they have to record minutes and seconds it took to read.,4.0
"Unfortunately, not what I wanted. I had hoped for a timer that counted in seconds; this one counts to the first minute in seconds and then switches to minutes. However, for its' purpose, it seems good. Well made, all modes working, on my unit the buttons were difficult to use and you had to press on the bottom edge of the button to get them to work.",4.0
This is probably the easiest timer I have used. I got one in different colors for each kid so they know which is theirs.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is there is no seconds timer when counting up and down so if I set that timer to count up- to see how long something takes- it counts seconds up to the first minute but that's it. So if I stop the timer at 4.5 minutes it still says 4 minutes until it reaches 5 minutes- I hope that makes sense :)  so if you are looking for EXACTLY how long in minutes and seconds- it really only does minutes so your timing could be off as much as a minute. But I use them every day and u can't beat the price-  great for times reading!,4.0
My son loves this bookmark. He uses it for homework when he has to read and time his reading so he can log the time into his reading log. Very helpful,4.0
Was a little difficult for my daughter to figure how to program. But she used it and loved it...until our dog chewed it up :(,4.0
This is an excellent timekeeper... if it works properly.  I purchased one blue and one pink and the blue wouldn't reset - EVER!  The pink was wonderful.  So I purchased a new blue one and this one seems to work just as well as the pink one.,4.0
"Great way to encourage my dtr. to get her reading minutes.  She can stop the clock, take a break and then continue her time on the clock.  No more asking ""how many more minutes do I have left"".",4.0
"Simple enough to use... had to show my son how to clear it and change modes, but he hasn't had any trouble with it since then. The two modes either count up (if you have an avid reader that doesn't want to stop) or counts down to an alarm (for the kid that wants to be done as soon as the minimum requirement is met).
It does make it easier to keep track of how much my son has read each week, but I don't see it as a necessity. My son chose it for himself as a reward prize.",4.0
My son loves timing his reading with this great tool! Would definitely recommend for kids. Works well for monitoring his daily reading.,4.0
My 8 year old daughter loves this.  She can keep in it her homework folder or in the book she is currently reading.  She was able to read the instructions and operate it without mommy's help! I is perfect for use in timed reading fluency as well as tracking total reading time per day.,4.0
I got this for part of a birthday present for a young reader that had to read for so many minutes per night as part of his homework.  His mom thought it was a hit because it marked his place and he could set his own timer.,4.0
Our daughter has required reading time for school and up to now we've been using the clock. She likes to get up in the morning and read and was having a hard time keeping track of how much time she spent reading. This lets her either count up how much time she has read or she can set a time and count down. This ensures she gets her required reading time. The bookmark also has a standard clock for learning to tell time and the operation is very simple. Press two buttons to reset the timer and an orange start/stop button. I would buy it again if presented with the situation.,4.0
"This product works exactly as described. You can cumulatively time up, set a timer to count down, or just have it in clock mode.

It seems very durable to me.

Be aware that the packaging indicates this item sells for $9, so I thought a $14 price tag was a bit overpriced.",4.0
"These bookmarks are great.  My daughter has 3 of them. I would give it 5 stars, but the purple one stopped working last week (we've only had it for a couple of months)",4.0
My son has used this for years now and loves it. It stays in place and keeps him focused reading rather then keep looking at his watch. :) Would buy another one.,4.0
Works really well. Is A little hard to activate but helps me keep track when I'm reading. I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep track of there reading.,4.0
"A bit complicated to get going from kids point of view, but does the job for which it was intended.",4.0
My daughter loves to use her new digital bookmark...now she can keep up with how much reading she does during the week. I think anything that motivates children to read is great!,4.0
"I bought one for my son who loves to read. This one is not as easy to lose as a regular bookmark. It uses an LR1130 button battery. You will need a watch screw driver to open the compartment. It beeps when the time is up. You can set it up as a countdown, count up or cumulative (adds up the time every time you pause and start again). It also is a regular digital clock when timer is not being used. Bubble wrapped. Made in China.

Setting the clock for the first time:
-Press and hold Mode button until all 4 digits blink.
-Press Hrs and Mins to correct time
-Press Mode once to set

Sorry there is no alarm clock function.  Alarm (or I should say, beeps) is only for the countdown timer.

Pros:
- Fun
- Cute

Cons:
- Do not lose the instruction. Setting the clock, or setting the timer may be tricky if you forget how to do it.
- Top heavy and thicker than a regular bookmark
- On setting up the timer, once you make an error by putting a wrong time (if you want 30 minutes but somehow you pressed the hour button), you cannot go backward unless you reset. To reset, you hold the Hour and Min button at the same time for a couple of seconds. Then the timer will go back to zero. Dont worry, it will not reset the clock, just the timer.",4.0
"This was a great purchase for us as my grade school daughter needs to read each night and this helps her keep track of her time.  You can either set it for the minutes you would like to read for or you can do an accumalation of time throughout a period of days/months.  I would definately purhcase this item again and would even consider buying at as a gift.  Seems very durable, would take a lot of effort to be able to break it.",4.0
"Love this timer!  My daughter is in between 1st and 2nd grade work as a homeschooler and reads well, but would MUCH rather ride her bike, etc.  This has helped keep peace by allowing her to know when her reading time is almost up without asking.  She also volunteers to read longer and resets her clock for more time when her stories are interesting!  Yeah!",4.0
This book provided some great facts & guidelines. It was fun & motivating. Nice to listen to in the car when I don't  have time to read. A good supplemental to the Wongs book.,4.0

But.....overall neat notebook and I would purchase again.",4.0
"The cover was a little bent when I received the lab book. Other than that, I was satisfied with the quality.",4.0
its good. Got it brand new.,4.0
"Good lab notebook but the page with actual ink writing on it is the perforated one. I'd much prefer if the carbon copy was the page that had the perforations so that I could keep the original and hand in the copy. I like the spiral design though, the other binding is cumbersome.",4.0

"I just received this notebook in the mail for my lab classes and I am very pleased with it on first browse. I agree with all the other reviews on this lab notebook. Do not hesitate to purchase it, it is a great buy.",4.0
"This notebook is exactly what I needed and it was five dollars cheaper than the one my school was selling, for double the amount of pages.  Definitely a good buy.",4.0
"First time using a carbonless notebook for Chem and it was so much cheaper than buying it from school. My classmates would ask me where I got it too. The perforated pages were a little hard to tear out at times. The references tables are useful if you need them, which I never used except the periodic table, but it's great for an intro/gen chem class.",4.0
"This notebook is fairly basic, but it does what it says it will.

Pros: The covers are very good at protecting from spills. The covers contain a lot of useful chemistry information (and a periodic table) which comes in handy every now and then. I've never had any issues with the spiral binding or with my writing bleeding through onto new pages (the protective cover is very thick and prevents any bleeding even when pressing hard).

Cons: The only complaint I have is that only the original copy pages (top page) are perforated. It is nearly impossible to turn in a carbon copy for assignments because the top and bottom sheets are bound together along the left edge of the paper. Since only the top sheet is perforated, the bottom sheet (the carbon copy) is very difficult to remove without tearing out the original copy.

Overall this notebook will performs well and I would recommend it if you don't mind keeping the carbon copies and tearing out the sheets you wrote on.",4.0
it is same with the description. Just the pages are little bit easy to break. and  the quality of paper is not very good. But it is worth the price.,4.0
"Original Review:  The price was right -- half as much as the lab notebook sold at the school bookstore, but this one is perforated so that the pull-out is the original. It's supposed to be the copy. I have to manually cut out the teacher's copy. The teacher laughed and said, ""that's what happens when you try to go cheap.""

Revised Review:  Whoops!  It didn't know that there were actually too versions of the item. I should have ordered the one with the copy perforated for pullout.  It was a very good deal compared to the price at my college.",4.0
We were required to purchase this for my daughter chemistry class.  We were given this specific website to purchase this item.,4.0
"A labbook, a deal for the cost.
Using it in an chemistery class where I'm required to turn in a carbon copy, it does just that.",4.0
"Good quality and much cheaper than what you can get at your campus book store. I purchased mine through the school's bookstore and only got 75 pages for 25 dollars. However, the corners of both lab notebook that I bought were creased and bent.",4.0
The toy is what it says in the description.  I just didn't catch that it wasn't an actual Lego product but a different brand.  Oops!  I could tell once I opened the package that it wasn't Lego brand.  Lego just does it better.,4.0
"I bought this about a month ago and it has proven really helpful!
The only reasons I didn't give 5 stars: It does not fit A4 paper (the European style) well, and most importantly, it is a little heavy.
Other than these, it is almost perfect! I highly recommend it (especially for US)!",4.0
this product is very hand while on the floors seeing people in the hospital and handy info is on the outside for calculations and med doses.,4.0
Works very well.  I agree with other reviewer that it does have capacity limitations but easily carries what I need for daily rounds.  Even if you don't put it in your coat pocket it is less bulky to carry folded compared obviously to full size clipboard.  Pretty expensive though; I think they would sell many more if they dropped the price.,4.0
"Delivery was timely - the website said estimated delivery 10 days but it arrived in about 4.

It's great to be able to keep all my papers organized and neat. You don't want to be that medical student with tons of patient notes and articles hanging out of your whitecoat-much easier to loose stuff that way.

Also while rounding it's nice to always have a surface to write on.

Ithas helpful reminders on the back of it: GCS, ABG normal values, acid-base disturbances etc.

This is a good product to have.",4.0
"I love this thing.  I gave it 4 stars because i prefer the vertical one to the horizontal one just because that's the way i like to fold my papers, but this thing works great.  If i could the the vertical one again i would be super excited.  So...White Coat Clipboard...bring it back!!!",4.0

donot wear coat but I do so works for me",4.0
"I like the calendar, it has large boxes to write in.  But I would like to say that the stickers at the back to tear out don't tear really well, they mostly end up ripping.  But all in all I am satisfied with it.",4.0
I completed a calendar for my son's first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he's still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it's something to keep recording all those special moments!,4.0
The calendar was just what we wanted. Delivery was fast.  We will get another for other grandchildren and will recommend to others who are tired of  cheap China toys.,4.0
My baby was born early and didn't hit many milestones in year 1 so this was perfect to record more things! Also great at helping me feel babyhood is still here!!,4.0
"This works perfectly for my daughters second year calendar.  The calendar days are a little small for writing in, however it works well for what I need it for.",4.0
I use this for my daughters second year.  I love the stickers that I can use to mark her accomplishments.,4.0
"There are few options for a second year calendar, but this is the one I chose to purchase. I was not overly impressed with the cover design, but it serves its purpose of documenting memories.",4.0
"I used this second year calendar for my first son and because of this I bought the First Year Nature's Lullabies for my second son.  Recently, I enjoyed reminscing about my first son through the Second Year Nature's Lullabies so I also bought it for my second.  Same concept as first year but for a second year calendar it's manageable and offers just enough to record second year events.  If you're very detailed oriented, there isn't much space to record memories just 2 prompts on each month and room for a picture.  So I ended up writing on the calendar itself and I dictated how much I wanted to record.  Some might want more places to put pictures, but I found it hard enough to put one on each mth.  I ended up printing them all out at once and then going back to paste the pictures in each moth.

Features:
Colorful, gender neutral
Beginning pages to record cost of items during child's second year (ex. gallon of milk, gas etc)
Child's favorites
Place to trace hand and foot
Month pages have weight and length
Two fills/prompts (ex., ""My new skill"")
Stickers (ex., 4th tooth, climb downstairs, drinks from cup)

Pros:
Spiral binding for easy display and storage
Thick cardstock paper
Colorful stickers
Colors have not faded in storage
Space for one picture each month

Cons:
Not many prompts/fill ins (ex. My favorite toy_____________)
Limited space to record your own memories, page in the back but not on each mth

After you've put in so much effort to complete your first year, you might wonder if you'll have the same diligence to record every detail for another year--the Second year Nature's Lullaby makes it easy to accomplish this.",4.0
This was the only calendar for my baby's second year that I could find. I like that it has holiday and milestone stickers that come with it. I especially like how each month has a space for my own photos. Overall a great calendar but it would be nice to have other style options for backgrounds.,4.0

"It is difficult to find tabs for the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  I believe these may be the only ones out there.  I don't know for sure, but I don't regret the purchase.  However, unlike the Bible tabs, there is no ""ruler-like"" guide to help place these tabs.  Please note that this point is the ONLY reason I gave this product 4 stars.  With that in mind, it takes just a little extra care and planning BEFORE placing the tabs in the book.  Regardless, these are very useful and very helpful!",4.0
Good,4.0
Easier to use than most.  I liked them.,4.0
Tabs are made for the full size version and so not straightforward to install on the compact version.  Otherwise the tabs are great.,4.0
"I have bought the Catholic Tabs, but they do not include a tab for the second book on Esther.  Otherwise, they are very good, color-coded according to the type of Scripture it is.",4.0
These will be very helpful to find the main subjects in my Catechism. My book is the one with a tan cover with orange lettering. Contains 26 tabs which I find easy to install. Even the page numbers referenced in the instructions matched my version of the Catechism book.,4.0
"Good product, yet tears easily if you're not careful. The cuts are not cut all the way through on some of the tabs. Be careful.
If the tab cuts went of in another direction, I was able to carefully tear the tab out. All of the tabs were usable and does the job.",4.0
"The tabs were fine, it was the directions that were screwed up.  Fortunately I already know how to arrange this type of tab, but I pity the poor guy trying to follow the directions.",4.0
Had a little trouble trying to locate pages where tabs belonged. It starts from the back of the book working towards the front but the page numbers didn't coincide with my page numbers and that made it difficult.,4.0
"I think most people would find the tabs useful.  It saves time particularly for apologetics.  They cost about the same as Bible tabs, though there are a fewer number.  I would have given the pack 5 stars except the directions that detail where to place the tabs do not correspond to the new hard back version I have.  It's frustrating to try to remove a tab after placement.  However, if you just check the index, and manually find each topic before you stick them down, they are excellent.  If I'd known that it would have been better.  1. Find topic 2. Apply tab 3. Do not depend on the guide.  Other wise they're great.",4.0
"Having tabs for the Catechism is awesome.  They are good quality.  It would have been nice to have a guide (as many BIble tabs do) for placing them.  They also recommend a section start at the bottom of the page.  My mind works differently and having the section title at the top, with the subsection tabs going down the page seems more like reading from left to right.
Used these as stocking stuffers for Christmas for my family.  They were a big hit.",4.0
"While I've known about Bible tabs for some time, as a new Catholic I'd never seen -- or even known about -- catechism tabs.  I had been wondering how in the world I'd ever find my way through the Catechism when I saw these tabs on Amazon.  I ordered a set and I'm finding them really helpful in navigating my way through!  I'd recommend them highly to anyone who wants to make that easier on themselves -- especially to people like me who are new to the faith.",4.0
I have an older version of this book so I had a couple of leftover tabs. It was a great purchase and easy to use with the instructions provided. I'm glad that  The Catholics Next Door recommended them. Makes the book easier to use.,4.0
No need to run to the internet when you have this handy on your desk. Wonderful daily motivational passages. Good gift too.,4.0
Very nice book,4.0
"I liked the book, but was disappointed that it was not festively decorated inside.  I corrected that by adding acid free Christmas stickers to the pages. It was a gift for a newlywed couple and perfect for recording what will become their family holiday history.",4.0
"I have always been in favor of journal writing, and when I picked up my first Journals Unlimited for Families, I just fell in love.  Ok, maybe falling in love is too strong an expression, but I find myself looking forward to writing in my journal more so than ever.  The prompts are vague enough for you to write about whatever it is that you want to, and to give you a direction on those days when nothing seems to be worth writing about.

When Amazon.com was running a sale on these books (shipping them free of charge), I bought a bunch of these and just love them!  I bought the one for Movie lovers, for Teachers, for Vacations, and this one for my family's Christmas memories.  This year, obviously, was the first year I'm filing it out, and I already love it.  In addition to my scrapbooking/photo journalism, this will add even more depth and specific memories that I find hard to write about because I have no pictures to comment about.  It's just wonderful.  I counted and it will have space for 26 Christmases in all. When 2037 comes around, if Journals Unlimited still have these around, I will be ordering another one!!!

In case you're curious, the prompts are as follows:

page 1 & 2: Christmas cards list
page 3: Gifts Given, Gifts Received
page 4: Special foods, recipes and baked goods
page 5: Notes/ memorable events of the past year
page 6: The Weather/Temperature was; Christmas Eve celebrated at/ with; Christmas Day celebrated at/ with; Other celebrations/ parties/ events; page 7: Decorations and trimmings;Trips, travels, visitors; Favorite moment, special memories; Hopes for the New Year.
page 8: Photos (for you to glue, tape, etc. maybe two 4x6"" pictures or a variety of others on the page)

The only people I think who wouldn't enjoy something like this are single folks (sorry, but I just can't see my single guy friends enjoy writing this stuff down), those who just don't celebrate Christmas in a ""traditional way"" (I mean, those first two pages are pretty useless to people who don't send out Christmas cards EVER, like my in-laws), or people who don't enjoy journaling or record keeping in general.  Grandmothers, elderly aunts, and even young moms like myself would love this!",4.0

"I bought this with a little bit of doubt at first since there is no clear inside photo of it. I got it in two days with Amazon Prime, and it turned out to be much better than I thought!
The outside is made of thin flexible vinyl-coated paper, as opposed to the think recycled good ol' composition notebook. This may be an advantage since it is easier to flip the pages, but I would personally like the thicker cover better.
On the cover, it says ""Research Notebook,"" so if you are picky and mind it saying ""Research Notebook"" while you are only doing a science lab class, this one is not the one for you. Well, if you are doing a research, you will find it say those words quite politely though.

Inside, on every page, there are spaces for the profiles for your inventions, such as inventor, date, and witness sign, but again, you will find it useless if you are using it in a college science lab class.
The size of this notebook is bigger than regular notebooks, so it might make you stand out from the crowd, but it also means more writing spaces.
In total there are about 30 sheets, which I found a little lacking. The paper feels good and comfortable to write on.
Despite those unusual characteristics, I like this notebook. It is well organized and doesn't seem cheap at all. I got compliments from my lab instructor too.
If it were a little cheaper I would recommend to anyone.",4.0

"This was a great layout, for all my labs in AP Biology. My biology teacher was definitely impressed, and even left comments on how nicely I organized everything, which I was helped able to do with this notebook. Keep in mind, that this scientific notebook is not a hardcover, so it's not as strong as a binder or other notebook might be. After a few months in my bag, the corner bent a little, as you could expect a folder might. This notebook was really light-weight, and utilized space on each page really well.",4.0
"The right intersection of quality vs price.
Slightly oversize, 200 pages, cover is thickish cardboard, not super rigid, so will get a little dog eared over time - and that's OK, by the times it's full if it doesn't have stuff spilled on it, and edges frayed, then what good is it anyway.
At about $19 it's about $4 more than I really want to pay - but the quad ruled with those little 1/4"" aqua squares are just so darned handy for sketching, tables etc.",4.0
"This notebook is very nice and exactly like pictured and I really like that there are multiple pages for the table of content so I can label each experiment without the fear of running out of space. My only negative is not towards the product itself but how it was delivered. USPS delivered my package and when the package came in, the mail carrier decided to forcefully place the package into my mailbox creating a tear along the side of the package. When I opened my package, I found that the entire notebook was bent and the front cover had a distinct crease down the center (similar to folding a piece of cardboard in half). Besides that the notebook is what I was looking for.",4.0

"My grandmother had a perpetual calendar throughout my childhood. As an adult I have gotten tired of having to transfer special occasions to my planner each year. I was excited when I realized they still made perpetual calendars. After looking at several I asked for this one for a Christmas present. My husband gave it to me and I am very pleased with it. The images are pleasant and low key. They will blend in with any decor, I think. It is a little smaller than I expected, but there is not an issue with it being to small. It seems well made with durable card stock type paper and nice binding rings. I think it will last for years to come.",4.0
"In brief I love sea glass. Does this book meet the bill? Well it does what I want it to do as far as reminding me about birthdays which I needed desperately as my memory is lousy, but the pictures are a little lacking.

"This is a fantastic calendar that I have used for years.  It is by far the best space/astronomy themed calendar on the market.  The curation of the photos and historical information is fantastic and the ample amount of white space on the calendar makes it easy to use.  My only caveat and the only factor that keeps me from giving it five stars is that this calendar runs from January to December.  While this is not an issue for most, my work is seasonal with most of my heavy work lasting from October to April.  Having to carry two calendars and go back and forth between them can be a little aggravating at time.  A July to June option would be most welcome.",4.0

I'm actually quite impressed!  My eyelashes look about as long as they used to be with Latisse.  For the price, I'll stick with the LaLaLash instead of the R&F or Latisse.  This isn't actually a serum; it's more like a thin gel. It's easy to apply and I feel like it ""stays put"" better than a thin liquid.  I use in on my upper and lower lashes with no irritation.  I haven't tried it on my eyebrows, so I can't comment to that.  Highly recommend this  before getting into something that's more expensive.",4.0

They even have a guaranteed that you will have lash growth within 60 days our your money back.",4.0

"I have been using jojoba oil for some time now and I have purchased from several companies. I really like using jojoba oil especially when I do my at-home chemical peels, it is the perfect product to soothe my skin afterwards.

As far as this particular brand, I would rate them in the top 3 that I have tried. the absorption rate is terrific and it is an added plus that it is certified organic! That is especially good for those who make creams, butters, oils etc...

For the price, you are getting a healthy amount of oil too. I would recommend this product easily.

"So I had extensions for several months and I loved them, but the expense and hassle of keeping them dry in the shower finally made it too much trouble.  My lashes were sparse after the extension abuse.  I've used the Dulash and my lashes are growing.  It's hard to say whether they would've grown without however.  What I can say for sure is that my eyebrows have definitely shown new growth, which is great, due to over-plucking.  (Be sure not to put face lotions on your brows)  I will re-order this product and see if with continued use my lashes surpass their regular length once they've been restored from the extension drama.",4.0

They arrived on time and in a nice clear, solid package so they didn't get bent or ripped on their way to me. There were 12 Thank You cards, blank inside, made out of a premium grade linen cardstock. I was very impressed with the high grade of cardstock used to make these cards and the envelopes were quality made as well, they had a peel off tab to seal them shut. They also came with a Thank You card from the company giving me a discount on future orders. Personally, I think they are pretty plain, but sometimes there is a need for a very plain card. Overall, I liked them.",4.0
"Nice texture and strong paperboard. The letters are nice, but the inking seems inconsistent on all the cards. It is full on some cards and flaking off on some others.",4.0
"These cards are fine but just nothing special at this price point. For just under $10, they're not really worth the asking price in my opinion. They are printed on white linen stock, which is nice--it is a good quality paper and matte, which I like. The embossing is a nice touch, too. The one printed ""Thank You"" on the front, though, is a little light on the ink in some places on many of the cards. The envelopes have a peel and stick closure, but they are nothing special--no lining and not especially thick. There is nothing written on the inside of the card, and the back is stamped with the pretty.simple.cards. logo. They come in a frosted plastic box which is in a cardboard sleeve. I do not like the plastic box (slightly cheap-feeling and fussy to close) and would have preferred a thick, simple cardboard box. If this were a $5 box of cards I would have rated it 4.5 stars, but for the price they are just okay, and there are better options out there. I did receive a discount for these in return for giving my honest review. I would really rate these cards 3.5 stars, but I moved up rather than down because they're a small company, and in the box they include a bonus sympathy card and a coupon plus free shipping on your next order of cards from their website. P.S. No matter what type of card you use, you can't go wrong with a handwritten thank you note!",4.0

Anyways, I love this planner and I will definitely be buying another when this one is filled up.

Otherwise I really like it.",4.0

"This is a GREAT product. I never thought that I would actually finish this planner but I did and I am about to buy the second one.
The only reason I am giving this planner a 4 star instead of 5 is because it is missing the option for weekend. I reached out the customer service and made that recommendation and I guess I am not alone about that request. They had a valid point about the length of the book getting too thick but I wish it had less weeks but included the weekends or give customer the choice and let them choose about the thickness/less weeks vs 5 day week. Besides that, this book has been great & I highly highly recommend it.",4.0
"This is the best minimalist daily planner that I've found, even if I'm still not great at keeping up with it--I'm writing this review as I purchase my second one. There are some things that could use improvement, though. For example, someone else mentioned that there is only room for five days each week, and while I think I understand the reasoning, many people could use a sixth or seventh day, myself included. I also wish pre- and post-planning might include scheduling. (I would really like open-ended scheduling--I'm a night owl, but all these planners are designed for early birds.)",4.0
Great book Just wish it was not cursive writing other then that love it!,4.0
"This planner is useful for those wishing to boost their productivity.  The most difficult part is sticking to using the planner itself.  I'm not big on inspirational quotes though, and the planner is full of them.  I could use the wasted space for notes, lists, etc.  And indeed, I sometime use white-out to cover the quotes and use the space anyway.  Another issue is that it only has five days per week.  This works well most people I assume because a lot of these planners use this type of method, but it frustrates me to no end.  As a student with a full-time job, I need to be productive seven days a week!",4.0

"Only been using this a week but I really like it! I find that I am needing an external master list of tasks because I simply have too many to list on a single day or for the week (most of the tasks are less than one Pomodoro) but overall I feel like this is helping me plan out my tasks better even if I get interrupted too often to do a proper Pomodoro cycle. If I could do proper Pomodoro and I had longer but less tasks, this would be a dream planner.",4.0
"This is one of those things where I feel like I could have just bought a blank journal and done the exact same thing.  With that being said, though, it's nice to have everything laid out easily for you to accomplish your tasks.  I will not be buying a second one when I'm done with the first.  I appreciate the effort put into the journal and how thoughtfully laid out it is.",4.0
"This is a lovely planner for getting over procrastination. Generally, I make a to-do list when thinking of the day ahead. This dives a little deeper and helps you to set goals as well. The quotes are inspiring. The layout is clean and non-cluttered. However, I'm using this as a means to be more productive in my creative endeavors. I already work a steady 9-5 job and require something to schedule my creative time around that. Because of this, I really wish the journal had seven day weeks instead of five. I try to get a little bit of work done in the evenings and then the bulk of my creative time is spent on weekends, so seven days would really be more beneficial. Aside from that, adding in a two-page spread of each month at a glance would allow me to use this planner over all others rather than having to carry two around. If these changes were made, I would buy this planner year after year with no hesitation.",4.0
"Nicely laid out, with helpful information about using various methods of time management to improve productivity. I have seen some of these ideas, before, and used them, particularly the Pomodoro method, but it's nice to have a bound book designed to track it. I was surprised that I noticed that the weight of the book and the feel of the cover fit comfortably in my hand as I was holding it up to read the instructional text. So, since I noticed it, I will share that it was indeed comfortable to hold. Not too thick, or to heavy, and balanced nicely in my hand.

I haven't started actually using the planner on a daily basis, but I have followed the suggested methods in the past, and dropped them only because I stopped using the print your own versions. I like the system and have had success with it. Now, that I have the very nice bound book, I expect I will use it regularly.",4.0
"Great concept. When your job is so multi faceted and reactive, this planner may not be for you.
Hopefully they will have a refill version as a good portion of the planner is instructional.",4.0
"I love the productivity scheme they suggest here and I think it would be most useful for people with large projects or work goals and a very flexible schedule (entrepreneurs, graduate students post-classes, artists/makers) who would benefit from a way to prioritize their tasks, break them down into manageable chunks, and keep structure. Those who already have very structured workdays or lots of concrete tasks and deadlines may find it more difficult to use the ""focus on the most important task first thing in the morning and don't stop until it's over"" scheme of the planner.

Design is very nice, good portable size. Paper is nice but a little thin, maybe wouldn't work with felt or fountain pens.",4.0
"This is such a great planner! I was looking forward to using it, however there are 5 daily logs per week. I need something for 7 days a week..

I also feel that there is a lot of intro and instructions on how to use the planner at the beginning, it would be beneficial to include that information separately, or send by email, it is important information, but I would just rather have a clean daily/weekly log.",4.0

"I bought this journal to help me with prioritizing my tasks at work.  It's very well made and nice to touch and write in.  While it's helped me be more productive, it hasn't been as life-changing as I had hoped.  I'll keep using it, and will likely buy it again once I've used up the 6 months of pages.

Two issues:
I don't know how well the cover will hold up. It is beautiful, but I thought it would be laminated or similar. It may be perfectly sturdy and I just need to give it a chance.
I wish there was more guidance on breaking goals down into tasks. This system makes me realize that I need to improve my skills in that area. I keep writing goals or overall projects down as tasks.",4.0
"This planner is amazing for my work style! It's something I've been able to stick to, and as a freelancer needing to be self-motivated while working from my home office, it makes all the difference. Working in this way and estimating time for tasks is great practice for putting tasks into perspective, so I don't feel guilty not getting as much done as I thought I would (because I otherwise underestimated my work load). I stay focused on one task because that chunk of time is dedicated to it, and make better use of breaks (and don't feel guilty taking them!).

The ONLY thing I wish was that it integrated into my regular Moleskine planner, so I wouldn't have to carry both.",4.0

"This is an enjoyable entry into the world of adult coloring . There is a useful full color tutorial  with basic information about color and pencil techniques and a full color double page  example . May of the drawings have tiny little patterns  that can get you into a kind of trance state . Some designs are busy others have room for  improvisation . Most designs  are of animals and plants  with an intense level of fanciful decorative detail  giving great potential for almost psychedelic results. On the other hand some of the designs are simpler  and rather than staying within the lines  we chose to allow the lines to define the form but not to force a multiplicity of shading and color.  O.K .  what that means is  we colored the whole deer brown  instead of going for the festive  fantasy look.  this was fun for us  ( several family members tried the book out. Tihw mage on the cover is fairly typical of the art style  so if  this style attracts you, you will probably enjoy coloring  this book.",4.0
"I love these ""adult"" coloring books. I've always loved coloring, even with my kids when they were young and now with my grandkids. These adult coloring books have so much detail and depth to them. The pictures in this particular book are mostly animals. Coloring is very relaxing to me. And with these detailed pictures, it really takes your mind off of the problems even for a bit. You are never too old to color!",4.0
"My first impression of this coloring book was what a nice heavy duty quality the cover is and the size of the book, in dimensions.  I was very excited to try this book out, I have used others in the past and still haven't found the coloring book I just LOVE.  I used two different types of markers on the first title page to see if they would bleed through.  They bled through.  So I need to purchase some colored pencils and try this book again.  Otherwise, it is a nice book.  The coloring pages are beautiful, there is a nice variety of pictures and they are good size.  If anyone can recommend some good colored pencils to use for this, I am searching amazon now.",4.0
"I have mixed feelings about this set.  While I believe it is a good opportunity to try Derwent Colorsoft pencils if you haven't before, and the pictures in the coloring book are delightful, the set does have a few shortcomings.

Comparing the price of the  basic 12 pack of Derwent Colorsoft pencils here on Amazon to this set, it is apparent that the coloring book is a bit pricey.  Plus, this is a set of 10 pencils, without a nice solid tin box, so the coloring book becomes even pricier, doesn't it?

If you just color just for enjoyment, then you won't mind the fact that pages are printed on both sides.  If you color to create frame-able artwork, you will definitely mind that you can see the shadow of the black ink from the backside of your work shining through.....  And if you color both sides, you will soon find out that the paper weakens and tears when you try to color both sides in the same area.  You will have to choose which side to color--and I've found that it is sometimes a difficult choice to make!

Which brings me to a rave about some of these drawings:  Some are really special:  The squirrel on the tree trunk; the fox looking over his shoulder at a falling leaf;  lady bugs hidden in a mass of leaves; a stand of thistle pods, and many more.

I did enjoy trying the Derwent Colorsoft pencils:  They are truly soft, creamy, smooth, with rich and deep color.  Trying this small set prompted me to buy a larger set of Colorsoft, and I also picked up the Derwent set of metallic colors.  (Really nice!)  Regarding this set of ten that comes with this set:  I did not care for the simple folding ""box"" that the pencils came in.  It's more like a sleeve, and I needed to find something else to put them in.",4.0
"There is a lot I like about this coloring book.  It's printed on thick paper, and it comes with a set of colored pencils.  The pencils are some of the nicest I've ever tried.  They color like you are using paint in pencil form---thick, rich color.  I love the suggestions at the start of the book for coloring.  I am not an artist in any way, and I welcome any ideas for my coloring relaxation!  The nature theme of the book is a nice one, and there's some variety, like make your own mazes and hidden pictures.

The few things I don't like---the pages are printed on both sides, so if you do one you like on both sides, one side will be hidden when you display it.  The pages are printed close to the binding, and don't come out of the book easily.  I like to take a page out while I work on it, and a bit of the picture ripped as I did that several times.  The pictures are also a bit repetitive, with parts of big pictures being repeated in smaller form with other pictures on some pages.

Overall, though, this is quite a nice coloring book, and I will certainly chose the Derwent brand of colored pencils next time I buy some.",4.0
"The is a great adult coloring book for animal lovers. The images are pretty, varied, and lend themselves to colorful renditions. The Colorsoft Pencils work just great - ideal for shading. If you like them, you might want to purchase additional colors. (I also have had good luck with using watercolor pencils - a little water on a brush and you have great blending.) My main criteria for adult coloring images is that the drawings aren't ""sketched"" but that each item has complete boarders; this coloring book meets that specification.",4.0

I will probably go through my ink pretty quickly however. On a side note, the paper is thick enough that I can use gel ink and it doesnt ruin the pictures on the other side. I do find that these help my stress. I have a condition that aggravates my heart when Im stressed that is very noticeable. But if I take time to color in these I've noticed my symptoms have gone and I feel much more calm. And its way easier than meditating!",4.0
"<div id=""video-block-R1GL2LSUUNNZQP"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1R0UDnpwOS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ZD7vTqPKS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;This is a lovely coloring book depicting the wildlife of the British countryside as well as the surrounding flowers and plants.  It includes foxes, owls, stags, birds, cows, sheep, rabbits, squirrels and more. The designs are drawn with firm, dark outlines and are made extra fun to color with enlivening doodles throughout the animals.  There are a number of geometric, sort of wall paper designs and a few fun challenges (mazes, areas to color yourself, etc.) which makes the book a little bit of an activity book as well as a coloring book.

The designs in this book are printed on both sides of white medium weight, non-perforated paper. The binding is glued rather than sewn (which is unusual for a coloring book from the UK.) Many of the designs merge into the binding and some portion of them will be lost if you cut the pages from the book. I could not break the spine enough to get the book to lay flat.  This could be a problem with designs that merge into the binding.

Thirteen of the designs spread across two pages.  In my book, the pages were not aligned well.  It seems to be a printing issue rather than an alignment issue.  I found that the elements at the center of the each side of the binding doubled slightly.  That left me with a design that could not be aligned properly. This may be particular to my book or it may be a general issue.  I am thinking a more general issue as the images were sized a particular way rather than printed improperly on the page.

Because of this alignment issue, the problems with trying to get the book to lay flat, and because most coloring medium bled through the paper, I detracted a star from my rating.  The designs are absolutely five star but the execution of the printing and the paper had problems.  I still like my coloring book and will certainly color the single page designs.

I test all of my coloring books with a wide variety of coloring mediums.  I will list those at the bottom of this review.  This is what my test results were:

All alcohol-based markers bled through this paper easily.  The water-based markers either bled through or left a distinct color shadow at the back of the page.  My India ink artist pens also left a shadow at the back of the page.  My gel pens left a shadow of indistinct color on the back of the page.  All of my coloring pencils performed fantastic. The book is published by Derwent and is supposed to be especially good with Derwent Coloursoft pencils.  I found that Prismacolor Premier Soft Core and Faber-Castell Polychromos worked just as well on this paper.  My hard lead Prismacolor Verithins laid down nicely and did not leave a dent on the back of the page.

These are the coloring medium that I use for testing. If there is something else you feel I should be testing, please let me know and I will see if I can add it to my growing pile:

Markers: 1) alcohol-based  Copic Sketch, Prismacolor double ended markers (brush and fine point), Sharpies (fine and ultra-fine) Bic Mark-its (fine and ultra-fine) and 2) water-based  Tombows dual end markers (brush and fine point), Stabilo 88, and Staedler triplus fineliners

India Ink:  Faber-Castell PITT artist pens (brush tip)

Gel Pens:  Sakura, Fiskars, Uni-ball Signo in the following sizes - 0.28/0.38/0.5/1.0 and Tekwriter

Coloring Pencils:  Prismacolor Premier Soft Core, Derwent Colorsoft, Prismacolor Verithins, and Faber-Castell Polychromos",4.0
"Simply beautiful and a lovely way to spend a little quiet time. The illustrations are all of very high quality, with a lot of little details, on nice thick white paper that feels just a little rough to the touch--perfect for colored pencils (I don't like the weird coloring books with way-too-smooth paper). You could probably use colored markers on this too; it's thick enough to handle it.

Some of the illustrations are little games, like finding stuff or connecting dots or the like, but there aren't many and it's a pretty simple coloring book overall, not an ""activity book."" Children with a good sense of design or ability to handle intricate pictures would do fine with this; it's many levels above the goofy coloring books they usually get, so they might really like seeing this as a more grown-up gift to play with. I'd have loved it as a 10-year-old.

I'm disappointed that the book isn't bound in a way that lets the pages lay flat; that really would have been a totally perfect touch, as would the ability to tear out the pages neatly. The perfect binding means that you can't get anywhere near the inner edges of the illustrations, which bothers me. (Most copy shops with large industrial cutting machines can slice off the binding and rebind it with spirals or something for very little money, which I may well end up doing as one is near me.) But otherwise, this book is still quite lovely and I think anybody who wants a way to spend quiet time or carve a little space for introspection and contemplation--or just wants something to do with their hands while watching Netflix and chilling--would like this.",4.0
"This adult coloring book contains 89 single pages that you can color plus the inside covers could also be colored, though they have a different, shiner finish.  The drawings vary between intricate, geometrically patterned animal figures and designs and those that are less so, but all could be considered challenging enough to keep one occupied for many, many days.  The many, different patterns encourage you to create and experiment with your own individual color schemes and result in finished projects that are unique to each ""artist"".

I enjoyed the information, examples, and the tutorial in the front of the book.  I didn't so much care for the interactive pages of finishing your own drawings, mazes, or the object searches.  I believe that some of the searches are incorrect as I couldn't find all of the objects in the tadpole/frog search, and I looked and counted numerous times.  Fortunately, there aren't that many of these distractions, and you can color the page, finished or not.

The pages are all of a heavy white stock and are printed on both sides.  Most all of the drawings are made up of small spaces that are best colored with pencils.  I also purchased some sets of Prismacolor pencils when I ordered this book.  They work quite well but are expensive compared to standard brands of color pencils.  I am happy with both book and pencils but fight the thought that I'm ""wasting time"" while feeling rather unproductive coloring.  I do have a sense of satisfaction when I see the finished pictures, or even the colored individual parts, as it takes a lot of time to finish an entire page!

If you are creative and like drawings of plants, insects, and animals in nature, I think you would enjoy this book.  If you want simple drawings that you can color quickly with crayons, pencils, or markers, this probably isn't the book for you.  It is very well done but requires some skill and time commitment to finish the drawings.",4.0
"I've not done adult coloring books before but several on my friends do and it looks relaxing. I love animals and thought this would be a cool choice. There are a variety of animals. I think the deer were some of the coolest but I liked the birds too. The book has a nice intro with tips on achieving different looks in the way your color the pictures included.
There are many different areas to color and each page takes a long time to complete if you want to create a cool pattern.
This book will provide many many hours of coloring and provides a nice selection of scenes to engage you in a relaxing hobby.",4.0
"I have never lost my love to color, but am not artistic enough to draw or paint.  This is a grown-up way to enjoy that pastime and feel like you are doing something pretty.  I only dinged it a star for the price, as you can find different kinds of coloring books at Michael's for about $10.  The paper is good quality and the designs on opposite sides of the paper are compatible and different at the same time.  I'm learning how to shade, which I never did much of as a kid, and there are several youtube videos to help you do this better.",4.0
"The Freedom Journal says ""Professional"" from the feel of the cover to the interior design and paper weight. Something about holding and writing in a professional book as you journal your progress toward you professional goals makes you feel like a winner from day one.

The morning exercises helped to keep me focused on the most important task of the day and the evening recap helped me evaluate how things went down and what I need to tweak for better success tomorrow. The twice daily aspect works to keep you laser focused on the goal, and the 10 day evaluation throughout the process is also a wonderful excercise.

Have a big goal and need some extra help reaching it? Struggling to stay focused on the one thing you should be working on? Get this journal.",4.0

Overall, everyone in our Challenge is making great progress by incorporating The Freedom Journal into their daily routine. As a brand, we LOVE that we don't have to create it and ship it ourselves... we can just provide the link for our folks to buy their own.

We'll definitely use this again and highly recommend it to anyone running progams as well as individuals running their own ""challenge"".",4.0
"Amazing journal! Meticulously well thought, structured and designed. The second you hold it you can tell the massive amount of time spent on creating the journal. The quality of craftmanship and paper 5 stars; but manufactoty rating 1 star. Mine came torn, it might just be the bad luck and the next one will not be deffective. Otherwise great job John Lee Dumas!",4.0
"I have read many writings from John Lee Dumas, get mails from him regularly, but have not had time to crack the book open. So much going on right now.

"Utilizing this journal, along with my Passion Planner, is doing a great job of slowly getting me on track with my scheduling, organizing, and ensuring that my priorities are being met when they need to be met!",4.0
"I've never been interested in journaling, but after listening to John Lee Dumas and his podcast for awhile, I decided to give it a shot. First off, JLD really took time to invest in a really nice journal. Leather bound, silver edging, easy to read font, inspiring quotes each day, a place at the end for writing your own thoughts etc. It really shows JLD cares about what you're paying for. He's not some get-rich-quick type of guy trying to make a buck off desperate people.

The journal itself is easy. Each day, you have two pages to record your morning routine, your sessions (the areas of focus and productivity) and then reflection for how you did for that day. Luckily, there's some sample pages for all you visual learners.  Every 10 days there's another section to reflect on your progress to that point.

At first, when I looked through it I thought I already had to be an entrepreneur or business person to make this work. After joining the Facebook Group for Journal owners (a closed group that JLD personally accepts your request), I learned more that I could use it for education goals, fitness goals etc. You don't have to be using this journal strictly for business.

It doesn't unlock some secret work around, you actually have to work and self-assess in order to make it work for you. There have been some people I know who have had to get 2-3 journals because they have had to start over because they only got so far and lost focus. But once you've unlocked the steps JLD has created and improved upon, I think one could continue Mastering without getting a new journal.

After seeing the Mastery Journal I am definitely looking into getting the Freedom Journal.",4.0
Very nice journal,4.0
"This is a durable quality journal with a strong magnetic clasp and is preprinted with large sections for password and URL information for hundreds of passwords.  The biggest disadvantage is that the size is not convenient for a typical pants pocket, it would need to be kept in a separate bag or in a large jacket pocket.  The security gimmick here is the instructions provided for creating secure passwords and for using simple ciphers to save them more securely in plain sight in case the book is misplaced or stolen.  This is just a low tech alternative to secure cloud password services and encrypted local apps.  This avoids the vulnerability of the cloud service being hacked and the potential with a local app of it getting corrupted or getting locked out of it.  The vulnerability of the low tech solution is the potential of forgetting the rules for your cipher or having someone steal the book and decipher it more quickly than you can change your passwords.  It's a clever idea and I would recommend considering this or something like it especially if you are currently either relying on your memory, using the same password for everything, or concerned about the reliability and security of the services you might be using.  You probably still want to keep at least a list of your accounts separately in a secure place even if you use this, because you will want to have a reference for changing them all if the journal does get compromised.",4.0

"Nice little password book, however it is awkward to use because there are no tabs where the letters of the alphabet are printed.  Because of this little thing..and it's little I suppose, I tend not to use it.  I find myself digging and digging to pick up the page.  They could have done better.  Shoot!! :(",4.0

"This one is good can fit alot in this,  But I like the flip password books better easier for me to find my information.  And I can just throw it in my purse because it is mall and compact but still lots of room.  But for home use this is a good product just my preference.",4.0
"This is the perfect size for my needs. There are six pages with three entries each for each letter (except W & X and Y & Z, which are combined) and, so far, I haven't exceeded that. The one I received _does_ have letter tabs. The magnetic catch keeps the book closed securely, so I can carry it in my purse.

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that several pages weren't cut all the way, and I tore the edges while separating them until I realized a letter opener wouldn't tear the pages.",4.0
"I am in need of some serious organization when it comes to log in and password information. There are just too many passwords to keep up with. Although, I tell myself I will remember this information, I constantly find myself forgetting and having to fuss with password retrieval or remaking a password and so forth. When I came across this password journal I knew it would be of good use.

This journal is leather bound with a magnetic closure. It is not intended to lock away and hide your password but rather teach you to hide your password through code. The first few pages introduce you to making passwords that you can ""hide in plain sight"".  The pages are alphabetized with the letter at the right hand corner of the page. The book of the book has a couple of pages for extras notes. Each entry gives you a place to write the site name and URL, your username and password hint. The journal doesn't intend for you to actually write your password out should someone get a hold of it. I like the size of this journal as it is smaller than I thought making it perfect for travel or to carry in a purse. It would also look great stored away on a bookshelf amongst other books. I love the leather bound look and it appears to be of good quailty.

In this day and age you are required to make a username and password for almost any website you visit. I definitely recommend this journal to help keep this information organized. It is also great for teaching password protection.

I received this item at a discount for the purpose of my review. All opinions are 100% my own. Like you, I frequently seek out reviews to make a decision before purchasing a product so I promise to provide an honest opinion.",4.0
"I have a memory problem since I have aged and need to jot down important things I may forget.
I found this compact journal notebook for a great price. It also come with some great tips for choosing and saving your private info which I found very useful.
It comes with 151 sheets of storage for anything you want to write down so as not to forget. There is also a magnetic closure which I love.
The only two things I did find a little worrisome about the book is that it it does not have alphabetic listing and the writing area is a little smaller than I prefer because I tend to write large. But for the price I can overlook these 2 items but that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.
I received this item at a reduced price to give my honest opinion of and I have done that.

"I like this book .. They definitely got it right looks wise. It's sharp looking. Looks more expensive then 12.00 bucks.
They offer a nice amount of pages too! No worries about cramming in only the necessary sites.
The CONS:
The font is small . I write small and it was small for me.
And the biggest con .. Which may not annoy people but annoyed me , the top of the page was listed with numbers instead of letters.
Why would you need this?! ( Letter is at Bottom)
Would be so much more user friendly is LETTER was at top in a different color .

Other then that I'm happy with the purchase. Worth the price .",4.0
"This is a very nice little book for keeping your passwords safe and secure, provided you keep the BOOK safe and secure.  I imagine losing it would give an identity thief everything he or she needs to ""get all up in your business.""  But it does suggest a way to code your passwords so that only you know what they are, and that's a plus. Shouldn't be to hard to figure out the system, or if you have your own system it will work.  If you're going to just write out the full password, then by all means, keep this in a safe or something, NOT next to your computer.  I like the size, the nice leather cover, and it has enough space in each section to write down important info. I would like to have seen it alphabetized, but it should be easy enough to buy alphabet tabs and stick them on the pages, or just write the letters in the upper corners.  While I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and fair review, I can honestly say I wouldn't have an issue with paying full price. It is a nifty little journal.  Just be sure NOT to lose it, or keep it out in the open!",4.0
"Love the magnetic clasp! Love the binding, Wish there were indents for the letters.",4.0
"Is it my imagination or companies becoming more and more demanding, not about a password itself, but THEIR determination of how many digits, how many letters(both CAPS and regular type), how many numbers. No wonder I am always changing my Facebook password. I just KNOW that there have been times when I have put in the correct password several times and when I put it in to change it they tell me that it was the previous password. Who can remember all these different passwords and not to forget that passwords are ""Case Sensitive,"" which just means that when you put in the 15 digit password, don't forget that the third T is a Capital T, because if you put a lower case ""t"" your password WILL be rejected and you will have to start all over again. So after seeing a couple of password books on Amazon, I decided to breakdown and get one. The first one was so big that I had nowhere to put it. I no longer use my laptop and always use the iPad, so I wanted something small enough to put on the table next to my chair. The next one I ordered was the size of a pad of deposit slips with cheap paper cover and four entries for each letter of the alphabet with X,Y and Z sharing four. Ridiculous! I found this one and looked at the dimensions and decided try try this one and kept my fingers crossed.

I got it right on the third try. It is a bit smaller than a paperback. There are a few pages in the front giving you tips on creating a password. There are almost 150 pages with 3 entry sections on each page and several pages in the back just for notes. There is a magnetized flap that keeps the book closed and room for a pen storage. This book has just what I was looking for and if it was sitting on a table it DOES NOT scream Password Keeper. There is only one thing wrong and the rest is so right that I will find a way to work it out, but I did take off one star because that might be very important for some people. There are no alphabetical sections. There is no tabs with letters on them and I really can't figure out why because there are plenty of pages separate into sections for each letter, so you will have to make the determination, what is the criteria most important to you. I do recommend it for all the other reasons.",4.0
I like the look and the magnetic closure. I received my order promptly. Just have a suggestion for future usage. It would be helpful to have alphabetic dividers to assist in finding what you are looking for faster. Other than that it is a great product.,4.0

"I had to have one when I saw this, so cute! Currently I have everything in the photos stored in the pencil case but I can fit 5 more pens (like the current ones) without struggling to close the zipper. The zipper and inside is long enough for it to be easy to take pens or mechanical pencils out and  back in.

I love the little details that went into this pencil case, especially in the paws, and how the ears are actually sewn to the head. The material is soft and the inside is lined however I took off 1 star because some of the eyebrow fluff on the Schnauzer came off while I was trying to fix how it looked :( (eyebrow fluff that fell off is in 2nd picture, next to the head).",4.0

They came in the rainbow, however pink was replacing red thats not really bothering as they are meant to be bright. Ive only had them for a around 45 minutes, so I haven't seen a coherent change within colors. They don't skip and are easy to write with. They do smudge if you wipe them for those people with left handed ness. They look absolutely amazing on black paper, and subpar on white. They are still vibrant on white though.

I think the pens were really nice. They write smoothly and the colors are beautiful! the sparkle is really shiny and noticeable. I brought these pens to school and all my friends loved the pens!!!!! I was almost popular for my pens!! They said they all smell good and I agree with them. The smell is strong and yummy like it said on the package! One day my pens got stolen and one of my friends brought that set of pens to school!!!!!! I wasn't sure if she stole it or just brought a pack but I said nothing because i didn't want to accuse her.

Even when I sniffed the paper after freshly using it (and getting a glittery nose in the process) there was barely any scent, and I am not sure if there was any or if my mind just made me think there was.

I bought these at a book store and they were recommended by the sales person. I really enjoy these gel pens but wish the scent was stronger. I have a hard time picking it up but I like the way the gel pens write and color. I could have just gotten a bad box or maybe they were sitting on the shelf too long. The one that really stands out is the watermelon one and it smells great!,4.0
Work well but there really isn't a scent to any of them.,4.0
"Nice markers, but there's no much scent to them.",4.0
"Really love these pens for how smooth they write since its gel. If you write in journals, this is what I recommend to use for rainbow colors. I also like that they smell nice when your put your nose to them. My favorite is the pink scent ;). The yellow and light green sometimes doesn't  work well but mostly solid. A con would be the price for how fast they run out but still very beautiful colors",4.0
"Fun for doodling, but they skip a little too much. I thought they'd change color as you wrote, but it seems like you get more blocks of color.",4.0
"I think they're cute, and I'I'm more than happy to have the set in my backpack, but there is one concern with me and that is that their bottoms, like thud little piece that screws on is a bit too loose. I didn't realize this when I took them out of the case, so now there is a mystery cap flowing through space or something. But yeah, its not nice to have a fruity smelling gel pen you can't take anywhere because you lost the cap. I was looking at the 5 other ones, and the bottom piece almost came off another. I do love these pens though, they smell amazing, and the colors are really nice, just make sure to watch out.",4.0
"I purchased these as a gift for my granddaughter.  She really likes them. The colors of the ink are very vibrant.  The yellow ink is a bit difficult to see.  However, maybe on a darker or black paper it too would be quite vibrant.",4.0
These are okay.  Don't last too long but for the price they are worth it.,4.0
"Bought these pens for my 10 year old daughter. She really enjoys them and keeps her busy on long car rides. She uses them with some mosaic coloring books that we got her. The pens have a fruity smell to them and are multi colored which she really enjoys.

The only down side to these pens are that the ink runs out quickly, and takes a while to dry so you need to be aware of the type of surface you are writing on.",4.0
Awesome! Love the scent and how smooth it writes. I gave it 4 stars because the lime green took awhile till its able to write smooth and since its gel. It gets used up quick,4.0
"Nice pencils, love the glitter affect but it doesn't have the scents that it claims to have on each different color pen. They all smell the same.",4.0
"I purchased the Tutti Frutti multicolored swirl gel pens to use in my journal.

Pros:These are really fun! The colors are sort of a muted neon sort of shade. They write with a good amount of ink and almost never skip. They skip a bit when you're at the very end of the pen, but I expected that to happen. I like that this came in a pack of five. Usually I don't really think I need more than one pen, but these pens run out pretty quick so if you plan on using these for awhile you'll be using all of the pens.

Cons:  The first color in each pen starts out really bright and bold, and once you start to make it to the following colors they're a little more blended than the first color in the pen. I wish that they were a bit more consistent, because I think it would be nice if the first page I wrote with these pens were just as ombre as they were later in my journal. These pens run out REALLY fast. I don't think I've ever had a pen run out this fast. The ink comes out pretty thick, and I got through one whole hue in about a page of journaling. I started using my first pen on Friday, and now today, the following Monday night I have run out of the first pen. That was a total of about 10 pages in my journal, and I count one page as one side of a piece of paper. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the scent. I don't really care that much, but I could do without it. I guess it's supposed to smell different depending on the color, but I can't tell any difference. After about a day or so the ink no longer smells.

I do have more cons to note than pros, but I still really enjoy these. They're really different than my usual black pen, and I think I'll use them every few months just to spice up my journaling.",4.0
"tween girls love these! combine with a journal or a book like ""coke or Pepsi?"", and it's a great birthday gift.",4.0
Lovely pastel gel pens and do not smell overmuch.,4.0
I love these pens ive bought three sets.  They smell good they write great they blend so cool from one color into another.  Ive used one pen for an entire page and the color changes turned out beautifully.  They just run out way to fast but I like them so much I'll keep buying them,4.0
"Bought these for my daughter, they arrived fast, are cute and gel writes well, but they aren't really scented as described.",4.0
"I love these! Everyone that sees them are jealous! I was not that impressed with the quality though. I mean they work, but sometimes it skips and I had one leak already. They are still fun to write with though!",4.0
"Smell is not very strong with most pens, but the colors are fun and different than most pens on the market.",4.0
"Just got them, they come out nice on skin just as much on paper!",4.0
"Fun to use... Colored in a pattern using all of these pens, but then started using up the ink, and was unable to continue with the color I wanted to use... Won't use these again for coloring, but like them for writing...",4.0
"The pens work well, write smoothly and smell nice, but even when stored properly the different colors of ink mix together and after a few days of use you might be missing some colors in the set, or new ones that have mixed. Also not all of the inks of a color will run out at the same time, so you may end up with two of one color. They show up really well on black paper and are fun to draw and write with.",4.0
Very nice!,4.0
Colors are pretty but scent dissipates after only a few minutes.,4.0
"As far as gel pens go, these are decent. The ink flows smoothly, never skips, and despite being scented, doesn't smell bad. But, they aren't spectacular. I would have been just as happy with a set of regular pastel gel pens. These ones write in just one color at a time, and when one uses enough ink to reach the point where the colors meet, the ink switches to an unpleasantly muddy color for a surprisingly long time before it completely changes to the next one.

I colored one stylized mandala design on 8.5x11 card stock using nothing but this pen, and the result was nice. I started in one corner and worked my way down and around. The design slowly changes shade as it goes down the page, and I receive a lot of compliments on that one. But I used up the started-as-blue pen, and now I don't have access to the blue ink until I use up at least one color in another pen.

So, when used up on one page, the pens can give nice results. Otherwise, the scent and changing colors are just a gimmick. I'm sure there is a very specific market for these. I am not part of it, and can't imagine anyone who would be. I'll eventually use them up as they are decent quality. But I can't imagine buying them again.",4.0
"Extremely happy with the pens, but the shipping envelope was huge. Not too earth friendly.",4.0

very lite ink.  hard to see.,4.0
3rd grade daughter LOVED these!,4.0
These are fun gel pens. Of course with these you always expect them to not write perfectly and have bubbles in between. But they are fun for kids that want to color on fuzzy posters.,4.0
"I received these as a gift and have been having a lot of fun with them. The scent is subtle and pleasant!  My only complaint is that the ink sometimes skips (with some of the pens more than others in this 6-pack).  The pastel colors show up especially well on dark paper; the yellow and green ink is harder to read on light paper.  If these pens did not skip when writing, I would rate them with 5 stars.  Great price, though!",4.0
"Cute, colorful. The ink flow ""skips"" quite often, so these pens are not very useful for practical writing/note-taking/etc. They're okay for doodling, though. The scents are alright; typical artificial-fruity scents, but not exactly fruity, either. I still like the smells.",4.0
Cute pens.  Some of the colors a bit light.,4.0
I loved these pens but the sceant wasn't good and the pink was orange but they looked cool and impressed my friends,4.0
In description it did not say they were pastel or multi colored. But they do have very nice strong scent that lasts on paper. You can see the darker colors on white paper.,4.0
These pens are great & have a light scent!,4.0
"I received these pens today after ordering 2 days ago, so it was great shipping (for free). I was really excited to use these because I love pastel colors and these gel pens really did look cute! However, I pulled them out and scribbled on a piece of paper and found that the ink doesn't always flow fluently and I have to go back over my words sometimes. They still work OK and appear very nice and colorful on paper.",4.0
These are great. I love the mixture of the pastels and the glitter pens. They are way smaller than I expected them to be but that's probably because I didn't read the description very well. The only downside that I have found so far is that some of them don't have that strong of a smell. With most of them the second you start writing you can smell it but with some of the others you don't smell it at all.,4.0
They were bright colors and smell too.,4.0
"Lovely smooth writing.  Beautiful colors and sparly too. The scents are very very light. Barely noticeable but other than that, would definitely recommend.",4.0
I would have given these five stars if the ink didn't run out so fast. It's sparkly and smells great!,4.0
"These are great colors, but a bit pricey.",4.0
reallly cute. one leaks a bit,4.0
"I have sent these to her twice now, they are her fav scented gel pens.  I may have ot get myself a set LOL!  Not 5 stars because shipping does take awhile...",4.0
"Got these as a stocking stuffer for my 10yr old, and she uses them with her spirograph set. They aren't an overpowering scent, like others say they mostly smell sweet but not sickly so. The color and glitter turns out beautifully. She has already said she wants more when these run dry. I actually got these at justice for $12.",4.0
These pens are pretty kool.  Has everything a child could want in a scented pen.  And they are child safe.,4.0
Used as a stocking stuffer.  She loved these pens and has almost exhausted the ink in many of them from all the drawing and pictures she has created with them. .,4.0
"This twelve pack of pens was a pretty decent buy. They have a great smell, look great on paper, and deliver on time. The only down side is that, as the other reviews said, the do run out rather quickly, and aren't quite worth their price. I would buy these again, but if you would use them a lot, you might want to try a different brand.",4.0
"I really like this book. He has great quotes in it and is sturdy with the hard cover. You wouldn't know right away that it's a weekly/monthly planner. I really like that it has the full month at the beginning of each month. It has weekly planning too - the only thing I don't like about this is that it's not in order. I think it would be better to have each page M-Su, but instead each day gets a full block (usually weekends are smaller to fit on one page). So, this makes it so that the weeks are all broken up and each page is inconsistent. Otherwise, I really like it!",4.0
"When I received this book, my first thought was that this is not what I wanted. But after looking through this, it looks like it will be very useful and will be a tool to help me jot down my daily thoughts and read inspirational and religious exerpts on a daily basis.",4.0
"One of the reviews complains that the item is not what it was advertised to be.  However, by clicking to view the inner pages, it's obviously a Bible-based planner.  Many people enjoy Bible verses without being ""Christians,"" so I don't feel that it was at all mis-advertised.

That said, I appreciate that everything is printed largely.  Also, there is a page for each month that shows the entire month, and then a full half-page for each day of the month.  That is awesome for folks like me who sometimes have several things scheduled for the same day; many planners do not provide enough room for me to write it all in.

I just wish it came with a spiral-bound, paper-back alternative so I wouldn't have to pay $14 for it!  I get the feeling that half the price is for the size and weight of the cover, which I honestly don't need.",4.0
"I like these notebooks very much. They are much more stylish than the typical notebooks and easy to tell apart from each other. They also have humorous writing on the inside covers. However, as other reviewers have noted, they don't stand up to much abuse. I used some super glue to lay the binding tape back down when it started to peel, and so far I haven't had any more issues. Note: I most noted the damage occurring when I left a pen/pencil inside. Earlier in the quarter, when I was less hectic, and putting all my writing utensils away consistently, they didn't show any wear at all. So, if you love the design, they work. Just have some super glue, and put away your pencils.",4.0

"Very nice dragon pictures, good size, I really like it.
The only thing I disagree with is the 16-month claim.  It has Jan-Dec 2015, which is great. Each of those months has a picture. The other 4 months? Sept-Dec 2014 are all on one page, no picture, squares only.  If a month doesn't have a full picture and its own page for the daily squares, it does *not* count.  What good is it having the four previous months when I don't put up the new calendar till 2014? I think they just needed something to put on that page. But it's hardly any harm done, unless you thought you were buying usable months. I just think companies need to stop making 16-month calendars, even if they were using full pictures for the other months.  I only switch calendars in Jan., so there's no point to having something that works otherwise--unless you wanted to do it teacher-style and have it from from Aug to May.
The dragon pictures are pretty good, all by the same artist.  Not bad, really.  They look like actual paintings (you can see a little canvas texture in some), not just the computer-generated stuff. If you want specific dragon images, or fancy CG, you could just build your own at one of the many websites out there that do that.  I am satisfied with this calendar!",4.0
"Ahh yes, the annual dragon calendar. This is a very nice one. If you like dragons as I do, you will enjoy this calendar for the whole year.",4.0

"This is a very nice Mass Effect Trilogy Calendar. Technically, it is a 16-month calendar, but the last 4 months of 2014 are all condensed into one page, but that's not too big of an issue for me. The artwork, just like the past calendars I purchased, are incredible and awesome. The artwork here is focused more on the characters of the series with only the month of December being a scenery artwork of the Citadel. One ""con"" I'd like to point out (which led to the missing star) is that they didn't really include all the characters. Characters that should have had their own appearances in the larger artwork include Garrus (how could you forget this guy!?), Ashley, Joker, EDI, Wrex, Grunt, Mordin, Admirals Anderson and Hackett, Vega and couple others. A few show up in the smaller pictures, but that's it. I've had two previous calendars and some of the characters I've mentioned have been left out of the larger pictures for the month and have been reserved to just the smaller secondary pictures of the calendar both times. In my opinion, there should be more team pics. Otherwise, great calendar to display in the office for any fan of the Mass Effect Series. The Commander Sheaprd trilogy may be over, but he still lives on forever HOLDING THE LINE! haha",4.0

"The pictures themselves are adorable.  My big complaint is that the calendar portion is an off-white color that I really don't like.  My calendar is the first thing I see when I walk into my cubicle each day, and the dingy (in my opinion) color is really off-putting to me.  I suppose it goes with the color scheme, but if you're picky like me, just be aware.  It also arrived with a bit of a crease which is really prominent with the first few pages.  Overall it was cheap enough that I'll likely just replace it. I'm sure others would enjoy it greatly, but those two little issues make it just not for me.",4.0

I've tried several lesson plan books and grade books since I've been teaching but this is the one I like best. I like that it is a standard size so it fits right on a shelf with other books and that it is blank so I can fill in information as needed. The lesson plan spaces are big enough to give details and easily reworked in case of snow of days. I'm actually ordering a new one to use this school year. The only con is what a previous user said. I wish it were available in hard back.,4.0

There is nothing like coming in 30 minutes before kids to discover the computers are down (we're sorry for the inconvenience) and your plans for the day are locked inside.

As a teacher in a small school I find my schedule ripples over the week like a seismic wave.  It helps to have a planner that ripples with it.",4.0

This is a great book to assist student fluency rates. I like that it begins with words and word phrases that build to reading complete passages. Great resource.,4.0
My 4th grader started with this book at the beginning of the year.  We go over the word phrases and read the passage together when we introduce a new lesson.  On the first day I time him reading the passage and circle any words or punctuation that he skips or misses.  Then each lesson has an activity to strengthen  reading fluency.  For example inflection and reading with feeling.  Or concentrating on punctuation pauses.  The next day my son reads it again and is timed.  Afterwards he completes the comprehension questions to make sure he understands what he is reading.  Last we take a final timed read aloud and he fills out the included self evaluation.  This program is worth every penny and has really increased his ability and more importantly his confidence.  I highly recommend it and I am picky when it comes to education materials.,4.0
"We liked these books for the most part. Having been born and raised in CA, I have learned all about these subjects, as have all of my older children. We thought that these books would be good for our younger children to read before we go back to visit, as we could visit some of the relevant sites with our younger children and expound on what they read about in these and other books. This is a nice addition to our other child friendly books on the subjects. We can use them as a springboard for further discussion and education.
Our daughters find them interesting and eagerly read them and asked questions that we could discuss. Just what one wants from educational books!",4.0
"These small format 32 page glossy booklets pack a lot of information into each volume. They are tagged as being suitable for grades 4-6 and for readers of lexile 630 to 740. I don't know anything about lexiles, but these books strike me as being more suitable for grades 3-5. I would hope 6th graders would be nearly ready for something a bit more advanced than these simple books. They are full color with lots of interesting graphics -- photographs, maps, letters, diagrams. They don't talk down to the readers, although two of the books use more exclamation points than you normally find in history or text books. There is a glossary in each volume and suggestions for individual and group activities based on the content. As for the historical content, it's accurate if a bit simplified -- the account of the Donner Party doesn't gloss over the possibility of cannibalism. but it doesn't dwell on it, either. I suppose it's inevitable that the Junipero Serra volume would receive the most criticism and here's mine -- the author is decidedly pro-Serra while briefly acknowledging why Serra is ""controversial."" It would be nice if sources were cited and further reading was suggested, but these are grade school resources after all, and presumably the teacher or home schooler will be able to point students in the direction of the library for more information.",4.0
"At first, reading the Junipero Serra book, I wasn't sure about this set. That one begins with a brutal attack on a mission by Native Americans who resent having Catholicism imposed on them. Father Serra holds someone as he dies. I was a little put off because historians are generally more sympathetic to the Indians' point of view than this.

However, reading through the series (6 books, each 32 pages), I think I understand the approach. Each book takes a different facet, even a different point of view, of early California.  Also, the writing is very age appropriate and easy to read. (California history is the fourth grade curriculum in California). Every page is colored, and every page has a lot of illustrations, usually drawings but also some photographs. It is very visually compelling and would attract most kids.

Each book begins with a dramatic event-- the attack on a mission (""Junipero Serra""); the discovery of ""Ishi"", the last of the Yani Indians (""Indian Nations""), the myth of a land of gold ruled by Queen Califa (""Exploration of California"", and so on The books are short, but there is a lot of information, well presented. There is a lot of effort to include women and girls when possible, including as illustrations.

They are unnumbered, but I'd organize them chronologically as follows:

1 - California's Indian Nations
2 -  Exploration of California
3 - Spanish Missions
4 - Junipero Serra
5 - Mexican Rule of California
6 - Trails to California

Of course there is overlap in time periods but this gives a basic chronology that begins with Indian nations and prehistoric mammals about 14,000 years ago and ends, roughly at the beginning of the 20th century.

This is produced by ""Teacher Created Materials"" and although there are no supplements with it, each book ends with several activities. as well as six comprehension (""Read and Respond"") questions suitable for writing or discussion.

It's a good series, presenting a lot of information and competing interests in early California in an interesting and clear way, full of excellent illustrations. I think teachers would find these easy to adapt to their own lessons and emphasis.",4.0

"I just received and am looking forward to trying it out for the new year. It came with a scratch on the front cover that is pretty noticeable. It's disappointing but I'm not going to return it. The zipper works fine and there's a little extra room inside to stuff notes and a pencil. Every month overview has both a quote and a bible verse and each weekly spread has a quote and a bible verse as well. My one major beef with planners is if they'll lie flat or not. This binding appears to be sewn and then glued to the cover. With very little strong arming I was able to get it to lie flat at any point in the book. However, only time will tell if the pages stay attached to the cover. It's really a nice planner for such a low price (I paid $12.99). You can't even get an ugly office supply store planner for this low of a price. If it hadn't had the big ding on the front cover, I'd have given it 5 stars.",4.0

Both have same drawings for planets/moon used in six films.

For the original films the art work we have seen for years.  Good artwork.  If I had the choice I would have rather seen photos from the films from the sets used.

"The pictures are very colorful and of good quality, it has holidays and important dates already printed on it which is helpful. When I opened it some pages slightly stuck together which wasn't a problem to unstick. Also, it shows marks where the pages unfolded from the base.

Overall though I really like this calendar!",4.0
"I actually use this for work. I write all of my notes, info and do my sketches and designs in it. First thing I love, the spine! It open up smoothly, I can almost flatten it out, and the paper binding is excellent, no torn papers falling out here! I love the design, the way the cover feels and the clasps add that little ""Please don't open my journal"" effect. I don't use the red placemarker really because I keep sticky tabs attached inside the covers, and use those as placeholders. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because of the weight. It is actually a very sturdy product and weighs a considerable amount if you carry it in your purse. So if you have a purse and you want a journal, I wouldn't use this. But I have gotten a lot of compliments on it.",4.0
"Really a beautiful journal. The cover has a somewhat leather feel to it, and the design is engraved in the cover. this impressed me, as I thought it would be a solid ""wood"" feeling cover, with the design merely printed on. The cover is actually bendable if you really want to bend it, and the leathery part is ""cushy"". An overall very good feel. I highly recommend this journal if you're here reading this review, thinking about getting it.

Downsides:
As everyone else has said, the locks are poor. I haven't had any trouble with mine yet, but they still feel delicate and like they might go at any moment. The place marker is a stark red, which is a harsh contrast to the journal itself; I feel that a ""sand"", gold, or brown place marker would have been a better choice. And finally, the journal looks very nice, but it is a lighter color than I had expected. It still has an antiquated, rustic feel to it, but it seems like they started with the light colored, gold designs and then added on the dark around it so that the underlining layer of gold gives the darker brown a brighter color. I wish it were darker, but I'm still satisfied. Honestly, the weakest part of the cover is the riveted spine, which is a nice touch but is definitely the most obviously ""fake"" part about it.

I still highly recommend it. I realize my ""downsides"" is longer than the positives, but I'm only so comfortable listing the negatives because it is still *that* good. If you want something to write in that looks like it might also contain some magic spells, look no further.",4.0

Disadvantage : magnetic locks lost their magnets and brake after couple of days.

However, it is really lovely and of very nice quality. It also has just a touch (not too much) of glitter that doesn't show in the photo. It comes sealed in thin plastic. Pages are just think enough for things like flower pressing, if you're so inclined. It also seems to hold ink without bleeding. I would definitely recommend this notebook!",4.0
"Things I wish I'd known:
The cover is a sort of cardboard with slightly raised parts to mimic the photo.  It is not as plush and bumpy as it looks.  I wish this had been more clear in product photos.  While it's very beautiful, it's not precisely what I wanted it to be.  I attached some pics to show the actual texture.

The color is a sort of a blackish green/blue.

The paper is great!  I tested out many different pens, including marker and gel pens, and there was no leaking through the page.  Impressed!  I think I'll be able to write front and back with no problems.

It opens very flat, and is great for writing in.  No arching pages to wrestle with.

The gold accents glitter a bit.  Very pretty.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  It's a really gorgeous journal, and the little details, like the printing on the edge of the pages to make the paper look aged, makes it feel even more special.",4.0

"CAUTION!!!  The USB connection exists solely to power the vibration and LED functionality of the headphones.  These do not appear to connect via USB for the purpose of audio.  You will have to use the 3.5mm jacks to connect the sound and microphone.  This is not made clear in the description and a little misleading in my opinion.  I bought them thinking they could work with either USB or 3.5mm but that is not the case.  Other than that, the headphones are very light weight and feel well constructed.  They are borderline too big for my wife so they may not be suitable for smaller children, contrary to some of the other reviews.  The cables for the most part feel sturdy. I'm a little worried that where the three connectors split out of the main cable will be a point of failure.  I've used a twist tie that came with the product keep them together in an attempt to act as a strain relief.  Time will tell.  I do like that there are no in-line volume controls as I find those are always a source of failure.  Sound quality is above average and better than I expected for the price (~$35 when I bought them).",4.0

"I've had these for about 6 days and used them moderately each day. I must say they're really nice headphones and an upgrade from my old ones which had cuffs that sat on the ear instead of around them. The sound started out very awesome and the bass is still pleasant. The vibration is cool, too. I do see what others mean about a vague humming noise when the vibration is on but it's so quiet I don't understand the big deal.
Anyway, today I noticed that these are starting to make static/tiny popping sounds when songs play around 50% sound [like it's too loud for the headphones to handle?] and the overall sound of the game I was playing was half what it was when I first got these? I don't know why. All plugs are secured and no settings have been changed. I don't keep my volume ridiculously loud because my ears are fairly sensitive yet on day 5 I had to have the audio at max to properly hear the surroundings whereas on day 1 it was only at half and more than enough.

I hope it's temporary as I really do like these.

Edit: The volume control was apparently stuck so I raised it to 4 stars. A little force fixed that [I'm always afraid of breaking things], but if the popping continues I'll contact the seller.",4.0

"On the package: Nothing, packed in a nondescript plastic shelf hanging pouch. On the item: ""Kitchen's Best"" and ""Bianco Brothers Brooklyn NY"".
My measurements: Overall length: 7-1/4"" , blade length 3-1/8"". Width @ widest part of handles 2-7/8"", @ widest part of blades closed 15/16"" @ widest part of blades open 13/16"". Thickness of each blade 3-32"" (about 2.5mm), thickness of handles 7-32"". Weight 4oz.

First impression is that these are a nice basic set of scissors. They are comfortable to use both left or right handed and reasonably sharp out of the package. They are not serrated; there are small etchings on one of the blades but I don't know that they serve any purpose other than decorative. Truly fine with me as serrated scissors are a bear to sharpen. These scissors are held together with a single rivet which is my lone (and very picky) note of where the craftsmanship could improve as the rivet is not fully rounded over. The handles are solid round stainless steel, not a bit of plastic on this product anywhere.

Some other reviewers have had the same problem. The 3 plastic feet under the cover is to blame. This doesn't affect the cooking or anything, just the look of the pressure cooker.

"I'm not a huge fan of multi-purpose tools unless they have been designed for a specific job like firefighting or some kind of rigging. But for the truck, tackle box, boat, trunk, or camp, they have their place. and this one's best feature is the combination hammer, pliers, wire cutter, and windshield breaker. The other stuff in the handle is a bonus.

I've had several multi-function tools with pliers before, and eventually you ask more of the pliers than what they are capable of doing. Next thing you know, the pliers have been torqued way out of alignment. These pliers are very robust and could be used effectively to turn a stubborn nut or pipe. It's because of the way they're shaped into the hammer head, because the hammer head needs some steel in it to be useful. But also because of the shape, the pliers are going to be best for nuts or pipe that fit into the rounded jaws. Anything too small for the rounded jaws and you'll have to use the flat part of the pliers. Any nut over 5/8"" and I think you'll find yourself with an awkward bite and handhold. Fully closed, the aperture is 3/8"". At full open, the aperture is 1"". Btw, the pliers are perfect for tightening your car battery posts, old style and new.

The tool is equipped with a windshield breaker head which makes it a good choice for the glove box. I was not all that impressed with the machining of the jack-knife tools hidden in the grips. And I could not find a seat belt cutter anywhere. It says in the product title the tool has a seat belt cutter, but there's no image of one in the product pictures, and I could not find it.

"I've been using these with my watercolor pencils (Inktense by Derwent and Aquarelle by Faber-Castell) and they are very fun. They are easy to fill up and once they are closed, they don't leak. You do have to make sure to tighten them after filling. There is a place on the barrel that says ""Push"" and you push gently on that area to get the water flowing. I would recommend having a separate piece of paper on the side to test that on first because it will give you a big drop of water the first time. After that, you don't have to push continually to keep the water flowing. These will give you a good amount of water so be sure to color on paper that is able to handle that or it will get wrinkled fairly quickly. The only thing I wish they had was a way to adjust how much water comes out because sometimes I only want a little bit of water. For those times, I sometimes push out a drop of water and empty the tip a bit and use that, because the brush will flow for awhile before you have to push on it again. If they could add a twist valve so you could reduce the flow of water, that would make them even better. I've seen that other people fill them with watercolor pigment, but I use them exclusively with my watercolor pencils so I only use them with plain water.

The bristles are nylon so they aren't going to give you the same feel as a good sable watercolor brush, meaning they are good for making strokes and pulling water across the colored pencil lines, but you won't be able to get circle shapes like with a good watercolor brush. But, for the price, you really can't expect that. You can get a nice stroke with these and because the bristles are a bit stiff, they are good for doing shading work because they hold straight so that you can so soft back and forth strokes to add a bit of water to pencil strokes and get shading. If the bristles were too soft, you couldn't do that. The brushes do have a nice point to them and because they come in three different sizes, you can do some detail work with the smaller brush.

These are also fun to use with lettering because you can use the pencils to get all your typography just like you want and then use a light touch with the small pen along the strokes to get a cool painted effect with your lettering. This will be fun when making handmade cards for people and signage for my gallery. Too many ideas of ways to use these!

While using them, you will notice that the bristles will pick up the color of the pencils you are using, but that doesn't transfer to other areas one you are done with one color. And they cleaned up fine with a little bit of hand soap. It says they are dishwasher friendly, but I haven't needed to do more than quickly hand wash them to keep them clean. The bristles are nylon so they aren't really prone to much staining. And even if they stain a bit, it doesn't affect how well they work.

I've left these half full in the bag where I keep all my colored pencils and they haven't leaked at all. They do come with a nice pouch to hold them, but if you're like me and sometimes just toss them in a bag, they won't leak as long as you keep the lids on them. And the lids snap on top when you are using them so it's easy to keep them on hand and not lose them.

I have another watercolor brush pen that I got last year and it was more than half the cost of this set, so they are a good value. And these are a bit thicker and heavier than the other one I have so they feel better in my hand and feel like they'll last longer. The other one is still working, but I wanted some different sizes and this set offered that.

Overall, I'm very happy with these and will have fun painting with them. If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know and I will answer them.",4.0
love the different tips and paint well with water no leakage,4.0
This stuff is amazing! I finally understand how people can make such beautiful watercolor paintings. This definitely helps teach you how to control and manipulate watercolor. It's so easy to remove as well! I will definitely be buying more of this in the future,4.0

The box was fine, but when I took the board out, one of the corners was crushed. Also, in the same kit, one of the paints was open and there was paint all over all the paint canisters.",4.0

"I'm in love with this product!!!
So why the 4-star rating??
Because as stated in another review, The Container Store used to sell these for $2, and the price on Amazon.com is WAY too high. Yes, this is a great product, but it does NOT warrant an Apple-like price, despite it being nearly impossible to find anymore. Not sure why Container Store stopped carrying it, but I was pretty bitter that they did. As a flight attendant, this is a great tool for opening cans on board, but once I ran out of them, it was disappointing to not be able to find them anywhere - including here on Amazon.
Now I've simply lost interest and am using a small Yelp-branded keychain to open cans, which works just as well.
I saw this product was available again and almost yawned. Too little, too late This goes for Ginsey as well as Container Store.

"seems to work as claimed, certainly better than other products made for poison ivy that do not contain bentoquatam. i have been exposed to ivy for several hours hiking, cutting with a machete and chainsaw, and loading/unloading, both with and without the ivy block. it does make a huge difference--from full body reaction that last weeks to a few spots on the backs of my hands (where the block rubbed off) that lasted a few days. but you must follow the instructions closely, wash with cold water (and dish soap or castile soap, less lather the better), and be careful of your clothing/equipment that is still contaminated. will definitely continue to use, but it still requires some effort to work properly.",4.0
"For my application, they did not work. I needed something to help keep my homemade sparkling water fresher than placing a piece of plastic under its regular cap.

"These are an excellent option for inexpensive freezer pop moulds.  Of course, making pops yourself is the only way to ensure you get exactly what you want in them in terms of sugar content.  Turns out most kids are happy with something cold, so you can definitely make healthier snacks than the typical commercial freezer-pop.  These BPA-free plastic moulds do a nice job and make fun star-shape pops.  My kids liked them with just plain water because the shape was so much fun.  The stick actually snaps into the mould so you don't even need to stand them up to get decent pops.  My only issue is that the stand isn't moulded quite deep enough to hold all of the pops, so if you do want to use it, it can be a little difficult.  But overall it's an excellent option for summer treats.

Note: I received a free sample for the purposes of review.",4.0
"I am a side sleeper but I like a soft pillow without too much loft but also one that stays cool.  This is just about there if it were a tad softer and had about an inch less loft.  I'll keep looking for perfect, but this company seems to be on the right track.",4.0
"first off - this is a QUEEN - when i got it it wasn't noted and everyone gave different sizes. you can get a standard pillow case on it, as long as you don't want slack. it does come with a pillow case is very nice- however it has polyester in it, and i don't know why i was under the impression that it was totally cotton. it was one of the reasons i got this pillow. i'm allergic to poly.

anyway, it does feel cooler than my other pillows. it's hard to rate since i'm surrounded by warm memory foam anyway. sleeping wise, i find it's a bit easier to sleep on as i have more support than my standard pillow shaped pillow (the edges taper to a point, these are rounded). however i also find my neck can hurt if my shoulders are on the pillow sleeping on my side. as long as i fall asleep with my shoulder against the edge of the pillow i'm fine usually. i no longer have neck pain when i wake up. and it's so long that i don't roll off the edge like i was doing with the old one - so queen is a good idea, though bulky and hard to travel with.

it did have a smell. its not packed in a box, i got it in a sealed envelope, looked funny on the stairs like that. but it trapped the scent in really well. remove the bag and the case and let it sit outside for a day or two. after that it still had a scent for a week or so when on top of it. and now there is no scent. the foam is encased in a pillow shroud, so it's really easy getting it into a pillow case (you don't have that foam sticking to things.) i gave it four stars due to the pillow case.",4.0
"PROS: Very durable. They're twice as thick as a normal t-shirt bag. No more double-bagging stuff, these things are really hardy! (Can hold a six-pack of beer, plus a bottle of wine no problem). Biodegradable is nice

The vest size (XL) fit as expected.  The vest is excellent!  It has a lot of front pockets that I need for storing equipment for my work as a project engineer.

"These are stronger than the all plastic clips I am replacing. However, they don't fit the 1/4"" holes very tightly. They do stay in place, but if you need a snug fit for the 1/4"" ones you are replacing the 5 mm sizes will not be snug. Again, they stay in with a little play.",4.0
"I've only slept on it for about two nights, but so far so good. It was bigger than I thought it would be, so that was a plus! It will actually fit a queen sized pillowcase very well (we have king sized and they are a a bit big). My husband LOVES his! The only reason I gave it four and not five stars is because when we first got it, there was a faint chemical smell to it. It didn't last long, and I'm sure it was because of the packaging.",4.0
"I gave this pillow 4 stars because I usually never give anything a 5 star rating. I just received this pillow so haven't had a chance to sleep on it yet.

I will have to wait to see how it sleeps until I get bigger pillow cases later this week. After sleeping on it I will give another review of the product. Right now it looks as good as my much more expensive pillow I have now that is old and needs replacing. No matter what this pillow was a great deal :)",4.0
Looks great. It's quite heavy. It's an easy dust magnet but you can expect that with anything black and made of glass. Instructions can be sorta confusing but it's not that bad.

I bought this tool after seeing it and handling it a local home center. I have a Fein Multi Master that can't be beat but I wanted a cordless tool also. I felt that the PC offered more features and included accessories for the price than the other popular brands. I have been using it pretty extensively and found it to have plenty of power and battery life. My only complaint is the vibration. All of these types of tools vibrate to a certain extent just because of the type of tool that it is. I feel that this one is a little excessive. I guess it could  be because of it being light weight but I tried out the Bosch cordless that a friend of mine has and there is a noticeable difference. All around it is a good tool but not for extended use.,4.0

"I purchased this slow cooker because I needed a smaller unit.  I have the larger 6 qt cooker, which is great when cooking for a full house (our adult kids with spouses and children).  But for just my husband and I, this smaller cooker is perfect.  I chose it based on reviews, and because it has the features that I was looking for.  Cooked BBQ pork in it, and the meat was deliciously tender.  Following instructions and recipe directions are important, but I also use my judgment based on just over four decades of cooking experiences.  Clean up was easy.  I allowed everything to cool down before hand washing the insert and lid, then wiped the base.  I liked that during cooking, the lid did not ""dance"" since that creates bubble messes on the unit and on counters.  One con:  materials used are not as sturdy as the larger HB slow cooker.",4.0
"My old 4 quart slow cooker wasn't cutting it anymore, and I really wanted a programmable cooker because I've never been completely comfortable leaving a cooker going without an auto shut off point. I was eyeing this cooker (which also comes in black:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hamilton-Beach-Programmable-Slow-Cooker-4-5-Quart-Cooks-4-Lb-Chicken/dp/B004KG06ZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hamilton Beach Programmable Slow Cooker 4.5 Quart Cooks 4 Lb Chicken</a>) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cuisinart-PSC-350-3-1-2-Quart-Programmable-Slow-Cooker/dp/B001E5CWVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cuisinart PSC-350 3-1/2-Quart Programmable Slow Cooker</a>&nbsp;when someone made up my mind for me and got me this one for Christmas.

Now Cuisinart's has an extra cooking temperature and longer cook and keep warm times, but this one has a larger capacity (4.5 vs. their 3.5 quart) and a wrap-around heating element. I like the wrap around heating element for even cooking, but that slight extra capacity is really nice because I can use a slightly larger cut or amount of meat and more vegetables and still have space. I also like that it doesn't have that steam vent hole because I hate those things. Your cooking progress is partially track-able because as the time lapses the light for the lower time frame lights up. So if you start at 8 hours the 8 hour light is on, then when there is under 6 hours left the 6 hour light comes on, and so on. But unless you remember exactly what time you started you don't know exactly where you are within the 2 hour increment. It's not that much of a huge deal but a countdown timer that lets you set exactly the hours and minutes you want (instead of committing to 2 hour increments) and shows exactly how much time is left would be even better. That plus one of those latching lids that Hamilton Beach has on some other models of slow cookers would make it pretty much perfect, if more expensive. The price is so low there's room for the cost of improved features as an upgraded model.

The Cuisinart still looks nice, but I really like being able to add the extra vegetables and meat and still have that comfortable 1/2 inch of space from the top of the food to the top of the crock for cooking space, so I'm still glad to have this one instead.",4.0
"It's a good pot: heavy enough, heats evenly, and made in the U.S.A., which is a nice plus. One mark against it is the lid has a seal between the steel and glass components that allows water to get in. I happened to discover this when some water dripped from this space into some hot oil. It was a bit of a nuisance. On the whole I liked it enough to later pick up the 12"" saute pan too.",4.0

"I purchased 3 pressure cookers from Amazon.  A 4 qt Fagor Futuro, Prestige stainless, and this Kuhn.  I am not very pleased with the Fagor.  It is the correct capacity, looks nice, built solid, but leaks steam around the handles so that it takes a long time to get a seal.  The Prestige is very nice, seals tight, and comes up to pressure quickly.  However, the handles looks and feel cheap, and you have to maintain your burner at higher temperatures as the cooker vents steam when it reaches high pressure.  The Kuhn takes the best properties of the other two pressure cookers, and efficiently cooks your food.  However, I have noticed it frequently drops pressure so you have to turn up the burner for a few minutes.  It requires more attention to keep it at pressure by increasing and decreasing the burner settings.  That is the only reason I took off a star.  Otherwise it is the best pressure cooker that I have tried.",4.0

My only complaint is that they are the dickens to pry open...fortunately I have enough fingernail length to manage it, but my husband keeps his nails clipped short and he CANNOT get them to open. That's the down-side. For the price, you get 8 handy little bookmarks, so I recommend them...if you have longer  fingernails.",4.0
"I like using these little clips so much better than bookmarks, which can fall out of the page when you open the book. Even if they don't, you have to move a bookmark out of the way to read, but these are so small they are always out of the way. They are a little hard to open, but other than that I love them.",4.0
These bookmarks are very cute and make a nice addition to clip to a card you are sendind to a friend.,4.0
I like this item as a bookmark.  I wish it was a bit larger.  I like that one side has an arrow so you know which side of the page you will resume reading.  It's a good value.,4.0
"I love these. I had problems with my bookmarks falling out of my book and loosing my page. These stay on and mark my exact line I left off. There are so many designs to choose from that are great. There is only one problem with these. After a little bit of use, sometimes the ""seal"" will come off and remove the picture. I would still recommend these.",4.0
Nice celtic design on one side with an arrow on the other side. They work great.,4.0
"I had similar bookmark that I purchased from a local bookstore. The downside to using a camouflage bookmark is that once you close your book, it's impossible to see the bookmark. It's camouflage.",4.0
Awesome bookmark quality...,4.0
I really like magnetic bookmarks because they don't slip out and they are nice and small so storage is easy. These are fun to look at as well.,4.0
"I like the bookmarks a lot. The magnets are quite strong and they hold my page in place with no problem. Mangetic bookmarks are so much better than paper bookmarks! Those were forever slipping out of my books when my book fell down. I only wish the bookmarks were slightly larger. Nevertheless, I will be purchasing more of them.",4.0
This was for my staff as a thank-you for all you do... They loved these book marks.. but they are a bit small!,4.0
They don't feel too cheap and they do their job well for the price. I recommend this product for a quick fix in keeping place in a book.,4.0
Overall I like this planner. I would like it a little better if I could fold the front cover all the way underneath and if there were a few more pockets. Otherwise there is plenty of space to keep track of everyone's schedule.,4.0
"I really like this address book a lot.  it took a little bit to arrive in my mailbox, but i knew the ETA ahead of time.  It would be better if it was a tad bigger, but again, the sizes are listed and its a great book.",4.0
"Nice book,  l didn't realize how small it was.  I'm using it for passwords.instead",4.0
Cover is lovely and the book is a small size.  It has lots of pages for addresses.  My only dislike is that the letters are grouped 2 at a time.,4.0
Attractive and just the right size.,4.0
"There is nothing wrong with this, is just okay.  It's small, but not too small.  I don't know why, but I don't really care for it.  Also, the ""S"" section needs to be larger...or else I need to stop making friends with people with ""S"" last names!",4.0
"Satisfied with the address book; fits great in a mid-to-large size purse; the pocket at the back of the book is a neat idea for coupons, cards, or notes. It is formatted to include all of the most important info for a contact. I have to practice writing small and abbreviating a lot though because of the limited space.",4.0
"I got this as a gift for my mom. The function of the actual address book is good because you have the option for phone numbers and email addresses along with the actual address. I really love the design on the cover of the address book and it is exactly what you expect. The only problem I have with it is the size of the book, it seems a little small and I wish it was bigger. But if you are going to use this in your purse or in some similar function then it is perfect. If you wants this for a shelf storage or something where it needs to be even with the other books, then this might not be the best thing for you to purchase. Overall, I was pretty pleased with the actual address book portion.",4.0
"Perfect size for me , but like others have stated a lot of the pages are stuck together .  They can be separated .",4.0
As advertised but I should have paid more attention to the size. Appears well made. Plenty of pages. Overall I am satisfied.,4.0
This is a really little cute address book! The cover is hard which I think is nice. I ordered this for a coworkers Christmas present and I think she will really like it. I am impressed by the quality and the cute details it has!,4.0
Nice travel size address book.,4.0
Great! smaller than expected!,4.0
It's a nice address book. Practical and well-spaced. Pretty cover and a nice feel when holding it.,4.0
"Smaller than I expected but quality product.  The print is smaller than I expected so this may turn into a gift, my vision is very bad.  Great buy!",4.0
"These notebooks are nice and well worth their value; I honestly think they're better than Molesknies and even better is the price. It handles sakura microns without bleeding, which is great, and the pages feel high quality. The spine is also very nice, and the cover is hardcover without feeling cheap. I will note--the paper cannot handle watercolors -- but definitely a great product!",4.0
These notebooks are a great value. I tend to use Leuchtturm1917 for my personal projects but I use these for my writing projects at work. They are fountain pen friendly and very sturdy,4.0
"I am a pastor, and I was looking for a small, attractive looking notebook to use during wedding ceremonies.  I ordered these notebooks because they seemed to be the right size with an attractive look that wouldn't detract from the look of a wedding ceremony.  These notebooks were almost what I wanted - they were a little bit smaller than I expected when they arrived, meaning I was flipping pages a little more often than was ideal.  However, they did the job well, and I would order them again if I can't find something just slightly bigger.",4.0
"I was really surprised how small these are. Not completely disappointed since it's nice that they fit in my pocket, but I really expected just a em... ""small notebook"" but they are absolutely TINY...",4.0
"I bought these because i keep loosing bookmarks and there are eight of them, I like the magnetic ones. these are nice a lot smaller than i thought they would be but effective and cute.",4.0
"My daughters both got these from Santa for Christmas. They love them, but you have to be careful when you remove them from a page. We have had a few rips. But they are bright and colorful and they work well.",4.0
Bought these for a friend and they were  a big hit.,4.0
I used this as a school prize.  Couldn't bring myself to give out the frowns.,4.0
Fulfills their job duties but they do slide off easily,4.0
I like the small size and being able to mark exactly on the page where I was reading. I find them a bit hard to separate/open when I need to use them.,4.0
"I love these bookmarks!
Small and attractive, work great on up to 3 pages at a time.
Stay on securely.
Great gift, and affordable!  I've bought a bunch for various friends and family.
Only issue: kinda hard to open them when they are closed on themselves -- a fingernail is usually needed.",4.0
This is a great book for people interested in learning the art of illumination.,4.0
"These are just a little bit wider than moleskins, which I very much prefer and I like the feel in my hands better. Not to mention I can get two for the price on of one moleskin.",4.0
gift,4.0
"I think it's a great notebook for the price! I think the page quality is better than that of Moleskin's notebooks. It's a bit thicker so it doesn't bleed through as much, which I really like. The only thing I didn't like too much was that the back cover looked like it still had the plastic wrap on it, while the front cover was matte black leather. If I had to choose between the Moleskin and Essentials, I would probably choose Essentials.",4.0
"You can use some pretty good pens and the pages hold up. The pages are much thicker than notebook paper. The outside quality is good too and feels great. I use moleskin at work and they last about a year, but at home I need more than one a year, so I'll be using these. I'm very happy with them.",4.0
"Nice notebooks--not up to the quality of Moleskin, but close.",4.0
"Seem to be good quality, no complaints yet.",4.0
Thicker paper than Moleskin.  Some strange waviness in portions of book not allowing pages to lay exactly flat.  Would be even better with a pen/pencil holder loop built in.,4.0
"I really wish Amazon would keep these in stock, apparently they're popular. If not, they should be. As a long time journaler and user of fountain pens, I have found quality notebooks lacking in the marketplace. Sure, Field Notes or Moleskines are useful for certain things, but in my experience - not when you use a fountain pen, or even a gel pen. The ink bleeds thru.

The paper in these notebooks is thick and heavy. Perfect for sketching and writing. I'm not sure of the makeup of the paper, but it gives off archival grade quality. Time will tell.

If you're looking for a step up in quality without a hike in price, definitely buy these. Buy more than you need as well, because they're not often in stock with Amazon.",4.0
"I was slightly disappointed
They are good... very good
but not the best",4.0
These calendars were shipped very promptly to my home.  They were supposed to be here within 21 days and came about a week after the purchase.,4.0
"This is the second year in a row I've invited Bucky, Satchel, Rob and all their friends to grace my desktop.  It's a great way to start the day.  Some of the more humorous cartoons I put on my refrigerator, where they add mirth to the day throughout the year.  If cats were as funny and as devious as Bucky Cat, I'd have one.  Maybe.",4.0
This will be my second year of using Mary's pocket planner and couldn't be more pleased with the first.  The size is perfect for my purse and the slip cover keeps the planner in good condition.  It is nice to have a calender with these features and wonderful artwork at my fingertips.  My friends always comment on how cute it is.,4.0
"The calendar arrived promptly and seems to be in tact. But the box was very broken down. I ordered this for a gift and I will explain to the recipient why the box looks so mangled. I don't know if it was the packaging or the rough handling in the mail, but this is one of the only things I have ever received that was in this condition. Once the gift is given, the box will be discarded, but I still hate to give a gift that looks like this one does.",4.0
my husband really enjoyed this calender however we were both a little bit disappointed that none of the cartoons were new.,4.0
Hard to read but funny. Graphics are poor when zoomed in.  Dilbert is always the best. Love him always. Ok to purchase.,4.0
"If your a Dilbert Fan, then here is your daily dose. Nice for anyone who works daily at a desk or workstation.",4.0
"Hardcore Dilbert fans have the books, but this calendar is especially fun for the newer fan. It is a great conversation starter if left in view on cubicle desks and reception areas.

One strip a day. Easily torn off to be posted on your office door, or that of your unsuspecting boss or favorite technical writer.

Each days looks at themes and the culture encountered in the development of technical products at a large corporation. Although tongue-in-cheek, anyone ensconced in that environment will find familiar frustrations and humorous shaping of IT life. The only challenge is occasionally, after so many years, Scott Adams' Dilbert comic strip is repetitive and cliche. However, if all of Dilbert is new to you, expect to laugh often.

"We have been using The Argyle Sweater calendars for the past three years, ever since The Far Side went away.  The cartoons are quirky and sometimes challenge our imagination just to ""get it"".  I rated it less than five stars because it only provides one cartoon a month.  The first one we had provided a new cartoon each week.  There are desk versions that provide daily and weekly cartoons, but we need the wall version.  We hope there will be a weekly wall version in future years.  It's great stuff!",4.0
My grandson will love this,4.0
"Silly humor.  Good enough to chuckle most days.  Do not anticipate many ""belly-laughs"".",4.0

"In a world without The Far Side, there is The Argyle Sweater.  Though it's not the same, it will still help get your day started with a smile and maybe a laugh.",4.0
This was a Christmas present to my brother and he seemed to enjoy it.  I checked a few days on the calendar after he opened it so I will get him another one next year.,4.0
Really enjoyed the calendar until today (January 30th).  My packet jumps from Thu-Jan 29 right to Sat-Jan 31/Sun-Feb 1.  Friday-Jan 30 is nowhere in sight.  There's no telling if any additional days are missing for the remainder of the year. Total bummer.,4.0
Funny,4.0
"Its Peanuts, Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the gang. How do you not like it ?  Not 5 stars ? How about a one star deduction cause I didn't care for the pic of Linus hugging Snoopy. I like the normal stock photo of Snoopy just at a sit having that blank eating grin on his face..",4.0
It just feels nice and calming to look at the pictures and discover the 3D images behind each one of them.,4.0
I have had these for several years. There are a lot of very funny ones and some not so much. Which I could say of every comic I read. I don't need much to keep me entertained.  As a bonus there are helpful hints and information on the back of each. I take the funny ones home and share them. Well worth my three cents a day!,4.0
Love it. Ready for next year.,4.0
"Off the wall humor, similar the The Far Side",4.0

I love Mary Engelbreit.  This calendar is a nice size for the wall.  My only complaint is the hole was so close to the edge that it tore immediately.,4.0
"Large enough and sturdy for craft projects brought home by your child. It has tabs to labels the years or write dates. There are plenty sections, but it prob works best if you pick certain pieces of your child's work.",4.0
I like this. It's cute with plenty of pockets to store things. Love the places for photos on the cover. It's more sturdy & larger than others I have seen.,4.0
Loved this book ! It has  wonderfully organized and has so many pockets to put their school memories in. Very sturdy and CUTE!,4.0
"This book is really nice. I love that it is big enough for me to put some special drawings my daughter did each year. It also has plenty of room for certificates, awards, report cards and such.",4.0
This book is really great.  The pockets inside fit a regular sheet of 8.5x11 paper so there is plenty of room for storage.  Pages are cute and appropriate for the grade level.,4.0
Permanent marker does not work on the pages - smears.,4.0
Of course it's very early to tell as there hasn't been much of the way of school to add the 1st month but adding some items for years gone by provided an opportunity to involve the kids in their own keepsake management. I'm pleased thus far.,4.0
"This book is cute (strange thing to say about an address book I know).  I like that the pages have been modernized to include Cell # and Email addresses.  It also has blank pages in the front for frequently called numbers. And...the fact that you can snap it open like  school notebook will make it easy to put a ""frequently called numbers"" sheet with each letter in the address book.",4.0
"I liked the address book very much!
Just the right size and pretty.
I would recommend to a friend.

"Cute calendar. I wish it were in more of a traditional format, but I will keep it.",4.0
"We are still looking for more ABC books but this one is okay for now amongst the pile. It's just kind of blah...I was imagining each letter on a page, but obviously I overlooked the page numbers and considering it's a board book. My daughter (2) still reaches for it but we will keep searching..",4.0
"I order this book because it was pretty inexpensive but so cute! When I got it, it had a smell to it and something slimy on it.  I washed it off and it turned out to be soap of some kind, maybe shampoo.  I just thought that was a little weird, otherwise it is a cute book for my kiddos!! :)",4.0
Not great quality. Nothing special,4.0
"This is kind of cute, but even my son, who loves Mickey, didn't really get into this book. We rarely read it",4.0
My son likes it. Cute book.,4.0
"I bought for my two year old son, and he loves it. His favorite character is Mickey, and he will read the letter as well. It does not have a lot pages but the 26 letters and pictures. But it is easy and light. Great for the small kids.",4.0
My child loves this book. The words chosen for each letter are a little his odd though. For instance x is for: x marks the spot? That's the only thing they could come up with? But my hold loves the pictures and the book in general.,4.0
This book is quite useful when you are starting college. Some articles are boring but that's to be expected from reading. Overall a fine book.,4.0

"As a first year homeschooling mom I found myself overwhelmed when it came to finding the ""right"" planner/log book for my children.  Many of the available ready to use planners contain too many bible verses and ""inspirational"" quotes for our family dynamic. I did not want cute little quotes or biblical reminders, just a straight forward log book. This is exactly that. I do wish there was a just a little more room for entries, I would have rated this 5 stars had there been perhaps three lines, as opposed to two. I could have done this as a word document and saved a little bit of money, but really it saved me time and that is more important, in my opinion. keeping up with tasks and subjects could not be any easier with this type of planners... jot out what you've done next to each subject and then tally your daily total at the top. I had previously spent over fifty dollars on two separate ""lesson plan"" planners only to find myself alarmed and dismayed when I realized that they were nothing more than glorified calendars made to go into a three ring binder. this is what works for us.",4.0
"This is a great planner for logging all the home school work in a day for 180 days. There are two lines each subject, 20 subjects for each day, to write on. Two lines is not nearly enough to write out a detailed descriptions of things done in a subject. Then again if you are homeschooling multiple children the short and sweet version is probably the best way to go. I've been crossing out some subjects in the book to make way for books read during the day, because their is no book log. All-in-all it's getting the job done, at a good price. I think I will be purchasing two of these planners again next year.",4.0
"I received a copy of this to evaluate.  I am so glad that I did.

I have been homeschooling for about 15 years.  Homeschooling is rewarding, amazing, and terrifying.  The amount of chaos that goes with it is truly intimidating.  This is what makes homeschool moms a great target market for planners.  The homeschool planner market is chock full of gorgeous planners with zillions of lovely pages to use for journaling, book lists, inspiration, cute quotes, daily plans, long term plans, short term plans and every other possible page you can think of.  Keeping up the planners can be a full time job

This planner doesn't have that.  This is about as straight forward a record book as you could find.  It is for use by your student.  There is one page for basic identification and grade information.  There is one page to list the general syllabus for each course.  There is one page to list the texts used for each subject.  And then, there are 180 pages designed to record all your academic activities for each day.  Every possible category is listed in a way that encourages you to look not just at typical assigned seatwork but also at activities and field trips.  One page for one day.  There is nothing else to this book.  I wouldn't really want anything else except perhaps space for a reading record.

If you want a beautiful planner with inspirational quotes and lots of sections keep looking.  If you want a simple straight forward planner that will help with excellent record keeping by you and your student- get this one.  Heck, at under 6 bucks it isn't worth the trouble to make your own.

I have just cancelled my (backordered) order for much more expensive planners for my kids and ordered 4 more of The Complete Homeschool Planner and Journal.  Simple is great.",4.0
"Simple and easy to use but I found that I like more space - I think the lines were just too restrictive for me.  However, that's a personal thing; the planner is well organized and easy to use.",4.0
"Great price! This is exactly what I was looking for. We homeschool independently and I wanted a record of what we do each day for law purposes. I do not use it to write out full lesson plans. It's very basic but is great for keeping attendance and listing what you did each day.  All subjects are listed out so you can fill them in. The kids never see this, this is purely for my records.",4.0
A very flexible homeschool planner! I bought one for each of my kids daily activities.,4.0
Very helpful.,4.0
"I love this planner EXCEPT, I only wish there was more space for writing per subject. There are two lines, but they are thin. I need more space. I found a planner at target in the dollar section this year, after I reordered these, that I'm finding myself using more because I have more room to write. On the other hand, the number of different subjects listed is ideal in this book. Not bad, overall. It'd be perfect if they'd create this with more writing space per subject - somehow!",4.0
"This is a really good book for homeschoolers. It is a bit much for elementary age students, but would be great for middle and high schoolers. The downside? It's 8 x 10 instead of standard notebook size which makes the lines to write on really close together. If you have very small and neat handwriting it would probably be fine.",4.0
