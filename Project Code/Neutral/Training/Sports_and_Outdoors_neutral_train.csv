"My husband bought this for me for my commute home from work. Although it is fine on main city streets, once I turned onto my cross street, (no street lights) I was pretty much on my own in the dark. Cars would be able to see the light in the dark, but it wasn't powerful enough to illuminate the street before me. I am returning it after one use.",2.0
"I went through two lights in one week during the winter. The cheap plastic breaks easily. The shells are hard to separate to change batteries. The attachments to the bicycle break. The light is bright, but not worth the price. The rear light is broken. The front is held by packing tape. However, the lights are bright and good for protection. Shame on Bell. Spend a few more dollars for better quality that will last.",2.0
"This is an overall good light.  The only problem with it is the clamps that are provided.  If dropped, the light breaks into pieces that can be put back together again, but that takes time.  Is not user friendly to other clamps.  The light is good but the clamps make it not worth the purchase.",2.0
"Very poorly constructed switch. Press it just a little too hard and its internal glue breaks. After that it lets rainwater in to short everything out. Not a terrible unit for the price if you are very careful with it and never use it in the rain. Flashing mode is adequate for letting people see you, but not otherwise particularly bright. It's an inexpensive unit that may last a couple of months.",2.0
"I thought this would be an upgrade to the Dogobie disc that I use with my dog.

Far from it. A big downgrade, actually. Within three throws, the top was punctured by my dog's teeth, making for jagged puncture holes that can eventually cut the dog's mouth.

It *looks* great, but doesn't even fly that well in relation to the Dogobie. Still looking for something a wee bit heavier and bigger than the Dogobie. This was definitely a disappointment, especially in light of all the positive reviews.",2.0
"So they look good but after  my boys used them the first day, they broke. Was looking for something a bit more safe for my younger boys to play hockey with. These didn't work so well.  The sticks are deceiving bc they are not 100% soft. There is a hard material underneath the 'soft' outer layer. So after a few plays, the inner piece broke and the stick was bent.",2.0
This is a really disappointing product. It doesn't perform like an Aerobie ring and it's not a very good frisbee either. It's kind of like playing with a big plastic container lid.,2.0
The set was very cute and I loved that it could be used indoor in the basement but the sticks broke after two uses.,2.0
The kids loved the Frisbee but from the picture they thought they were getting 4 of them.  They saved up their cash and split the cost but a lot of disappointment is still surrounding the fact that only one disk came.  The picture is deceptive and looks exactly like the typical frisbee golf packs of four.  I should have read the title with a little more effort;-(,2.0
Pretty disappointed in this frisbee as I have bought other Aerobie products and loved them. This was not heavy weight or made of a a durable plastic. Did not fly well and would not recommend buying unless it is for a small child.,2.0
"I've got an 80# lab that loves her frisbees. I've bought at least 10, here on Amazon, and here is what I've learned:
The BEST frisbee is the GUMABONE genuine Frisbee from the Nylabone folks - just make sure you get the one that looks like a frisbee, not the one with the bone molded in the top.

1. Gumabone frisbee (no molded bone): the best, flys well and darn near industructible. Does not float.
2. Gumabone frisbee with molede bone: poor flyer, but indestructible.
3. Nylabone frisbee (same as gumabone, but HARD NYLON): not recommended; flys well, but so hard it can knock out teeth.
4. Jawz disc: 9"" diameter, harder plastic, flys OK. This is one of my backups.
5. Vibram rubber disc: poor flyer but good as a tug toy.
6. Aerobie Superdisc: Flimsy, and flys poorly once dog bends it, and chews it up.
7. Aerobie Dogobie: Small, flimsy, poor flyer. Good for a smaller dog as a toy, or puppy training.
8. Genuine Frisbees, any size: best flyers, but <1hr. life span.",2.0
"I disagree with the other reviewers. This is a cheap child's toy. Buy a regular hard disc if you want to throw it far. It's too lightweight to get any real distance. It does have a nice soft border but that is probably the only thing going for it. Great for a dog, but no distance champion. Buy a cheaper Discraft or something in the 170-180 gram range if you want distance.
It wasn't worth the 12$ I paid for it at Academy.",2.0
"I saw other kids using something similar and thought we would give it a try for our 7 year old who is a soccer nut.  When we got it home it was pretty easy to put his ball in and learn how to use the waist strap.  He has a size 5 ball, but it will work on a size 4 also.  He immediately went outside and started playing around and fell in love with this.  He can kick, juggle, and punt with fun by himself and loves it.  The first thing we noticed is that the string is not a bungie type, but a cord type.  This is ok as with the length it has it can be kicked hard and not snap back, or it can be held and the ball can be used for juggling.  The issue we found right away is that it will twist up like an old phone cord and get shorter - so every so often you will have to unwind or untwist it.  The main 2 star issue that I have with this is that after a few hours (and a few days) some of the netting has broken from his kicks!  The netting cord is very thin - about a size of pencil lead.  It will not last.  I have seen other ones where the ball netting is like yarn thread which looks like it will last longer.  2-3 days, really?  He kicks hard, but really?  Still looking for a durable one.",2.0
Make sure you have water or a drink around when eating these. They really make you feel a bit nauseous too if you're not used to it. I remember getting lightheaded just because I hadn't had these in a while. They're yummy but you get sick of them really fast.,2.0
The description says 7 oz packages. I received all 0.7 oz packages. That's a HUGE difference!,2.0
it's not really like ice cream,2.0
Too sweet. Has a tiny taste of (artificial?) ice cream flavor but otherwise nothing like it. Feels like packaging popcorn fillers in mouth.,2.0
Don't expect the usual brick of astronaut ice cream. All were broken upon arrival.  I chose not to return them as they are still edible.,2.0
"My astronaut ice cream arrived in crumbs and not bars, I don't know if this is buyer specific but should be careful.",2.0
"Its ok not much more, used the items twice and already it has a small hole to be patched.  Forget about the battery pump, you will need to buy the electric pump if you don't want to wait 30 mins + for it to fill up.",2.0
"I purchased this mattress during the summer of 2008.  Very portable. Easily roles up into a small package.  Comes with a handy battery operated pump (which has lasted all year on the original 4 D batteries that I put in).  I love the way it deflates the bed.  Gets all the air out in about 2 minutes.

The problem with the bed is that it has a hard time keeping its shape.  The pump will blow it up so that it appears to be inflated, however, it will need about 15 to 20 additional blows with your lungs in order to bring it to an acceptable density (I like it a little softer).  Once you lay on the bed for more than 1 hr you notice that it starts to deflate a bit.  The first 5 times I used it only lost 10% to 15% of its air after sleeping on it for 8 hrs.  During my most recent camping trip it lost 100% of its air within 2 hrs.

I guess you get what you pay for.  At least I got a nice little pump out of it and about 5 uses out of the mattress for under $30.",2.0
"I've had 3 Coleman air beds.  They've all leaked so quickly, I would assume there was a hole and bought new ones.  I fill it at night for 1-2 guests, and then by morning, they're pretty much sleeping on the floor.  The fabric is fine and it inflates at a good time.  The bed is too big to fold into the black ""bag"" completely (like the way it comes when you first buy it).  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed because it doesn't keep air.",2.0
"It blew up this big beach ball-5'5"" tall just fine, and deflated it too. The pump is very loud, it's also large and a bit heavy at about 3lbs, something to consider if you want to pack/carry it very far.",2.0
"We were gifted this pump for our wedding just under two years ago. Have used it a handful of times, the last being in February of this year. When I went to fill up our air mattress in June, it was no longer working and would not charge. I contacted Coleman to see if there was some sort of warranty, but unfortunately it's only good for a year. I was told that the pump needs to be used ever 3-6 months to keep it working otherwise it will die?! Seems ridiculous. It worked well while we had it but it lasted less than two years. I'll be making a purchase with a different manufacturer this time.",2.0
I have had two of these pumps- they both stopped working within 2-3 years (each used approximately 4-6 times total to blow up air mattress for camping). Worked well while it lasted but I'm disappointed with how quickly they break.,2.0
"I bought this pump, December 23,  2016, to inflate a full size mattress. It worked fine and then the pump was used a few times until March 2017 when it was noticed that the battery wasn't recharging to full compacity. After a few minutes of use, pumped stopped working. Sometimes I had it on charger all day and it stopped working within seconds of turning it on. Now, June 2017, the pump won't charge and if it's connected to the power source, the motor grinds a little and then stops.  Normally, I would recommend using Colman because I have numerous Colman camping products. So until Colman fixes this product, I recommend another brand.",2.0
"So far, I haven't had some of the the problems with failure to charge (or to hold a charge) that other users describe.  I charged it for 10 hours, and on our first off-grid reunion, the pump inflated four queen-size air mattresses and a 9-ft vinyl raft...after that, it was out of juice.  I thought that was less-than-stellar battery performance...but it was reasonable...sort of.  That being said, I have a bunch of other issues with this item:

  (a) It isn't a Coleman-made product.  It is a cheap piece of Chinese junk.  My wife bought it, not on Amazon, but at a local store, because she trusted the Coleman name.  BIG mistake.  When I called Coleman's customer service line with my concerns, their people would take NO responsibility for this product.

  (b) There are no lights ANYwhere to indicate if the battery is charging, or fully charged, or defective.  It has been (I believe) more than 25 years since simple, INEXPENSIVE circuits were developed to show these battery states.  On a $40 inflator, why not spend the extra $2 (or less) to install these circuits and a couple of LED bulbs?  I am positive they could pass this cost on to the consumer -- I mean, who wouldn't pay a couple of bucks more to know how the charge-cycle is going, or to find out the battery is defective BEFORE the next camping trip?

  (b) There is no overcharge-protection circuit, the kind that allows you to leave the unit plugged in as long as you want without destroying the battery.  Again, such circuits are cheap and have been around for a long time.  And again, who wouldn't pay the extra buck or two to be sure the battery wasn't going to cook?

  (c) This little unit is the noisiest pump I've ever owned.  Yeah, all these little inflators make noise, but this one can drown out the noise of a train passing 50 yards away.

  (d) The included nozzles fit the out-flow port, but not the air intake port.  Because the intake-port is so short, you can't attach it the Boston valves on mattresses or inflatable-rafts -- nowadays they are mostly seated within hard plastic recesses.  Yeah, you can just do the old squeeze-fold-squeeze-fold-squeeze routine, but if I spend $40 on an inflator, I'd like to be able to deflate a big raft with it, too.  Of course, with the battery being nearly dead, it wouldn't have worked anyway.

But heck, other than that, it's just great (...not).  Do yourself a favor, get one of the Texsport double-action HAND pumps.  The higher-volume one goes for about $26 (including shipping) at various sites.  If you want youngsters to inflate their own mattresses, they'd likely find it easier to use the lower-volume unit, it goes for about $23 from Midway (again, including shipping).  These little pumps are inexpensive, high quality, heavy polymer plastic. They pump on both strokes, so they do the job pretty fast.  You can use them to inflate AND deflate (just move the hose to the other side of the handle).  A bonus -- they work with water as well as air, so you can use them as bilge-pumps, too, if the water doesn't have too much debris it it.  Best of all, you get a moderate workout while being able to hear the birds singing or the kids drowning.",2.0
"I've had two of these and the batteries in them last, maybe, a year.  After that, they won't take a charge any more.  That plus Coleman air mattresses lasting about the same length of time before springing leaks, it's getting too expensive to continue to use these.",2.0
"Mine didn't work when I received it which was a big time bummer on the camping trip I had planned, but they were great about my refund and it was most likely a one-off bust as Coleman usually doesn't let me down.",2.0
Got it to fill my new colorado xt pontoon.  It did ok but couldn't reach pressure of 2.5 #.  I  just purchased a K hand pump to resolve the issue.,2.0
Didn't hold a charge.,2.0
"I had the predecessor to this model which Colman no longer makes. It was powerful and the charge lasted forever. This next generation is worthless. Pump takes a long time to charge and has a super week air flow. This was not suitable for anything you want inflated firmly like an air mattress or inner tube - and that's is what you buy this for, right? Why two stars and not one? It did actually blow air out, so that's something.",2.0
"Bought this pump to inflate a kiddie pool. It does not come charged. It needs to be charged for 10 hours prior to first use. That is annoying. However, what really irked us is that it won't operate off the plug. So, for 10 hours, it will do nothing. Basically, a summer day wasted.",2.0
"Doesn't fill up an intex excursion 5 very well, you'll have to hand pump for a while after.

Obnoxiously loud, heavy for a air pump, gets very hot, and just doesn't seem to have much air pressure.  It works good for inflating the small rafts and seats/cushions for my intex excursion 5, but that's about it.  I bought it for convenience and it turned out to be a pain.

****UPDATE 6/20/15****
After using it about 6-7 times it will no longer power on.
This thing is a total piece of crap, and I can't even return it.  0 Stars if it was possible.
Thanks a lot Coleman.  <Insert sarcasm>

****UPDATE 6/24/15****
I took the pump apart, ripped out the battery, diagnosed it on my smart charger -- which told me that the battery was dead and will not hold a charge.  I ordered a ExpertPower EXP645 6V 4.5 Amp Rechargeable Battery for $11 and installed it -- it now works better than it ever has.  I am leaving 2 stars as I shouldn't have to replace the battery right after purchasing it, they are shipping these units out with dead/near-dead batteries.  Anyway, just thought I would let everyone know, in case you are having the same problem, it's the battery.",2.0
"When the product arrived, the box was damaged and torn, and the pump was missing the wall charger and adapter nozzles, making the pump useless without either of those. I did call the Coleman manufacturers, however, who were very helpful in having the replacement parts sent to my home within the next week. Luckily I don't need the pump for another few weeks, otherwise this would have been a huuuuuuge inconvenience",2.0
"Perhaps mine was defective but it was flat out offensively, piercingly loud to the point where it was painful to use. Much louder then a full sized vacuum cleaner. Even outdoors during the day time it would seriously annoying everyone within ear shot. I've used other electric air pumps in the past and they were at most half as loud. I can't imagine a product designed so poorly being intentional and will give Coleman the benefit of the doubt that mine was defective. It has enough battery power to fill up an Intex Excusion 5 Inflatable 5 person boat fine outside of having to use a hand pump for the last bit of high air pressure but the noise renders it not usable. It left my ears ringing. Returning as defective.",2.0
It's under powered. Takes a long time to fill anything up.,2.0
"This pump has plenty of power and the fact that it's rechargeable is nice, however the noises this pump makes are it's fatal drawback.  The pump must operate at a loud 80db.  Not exactly what you'd look for in a pump you plan to use while camping in the woods.  My advice...  Go with another pump.",2.0
"We had to buy another charge while camping because the pump ran out of juice and would not work even plugged in.
We bought a cheap one that worked with batteries and were lucky there was a store open at night.  It happened again recently and fortunately friends camping with us had the Coleman electric pump.  Colemen needs to make a rechargeable that can also be used as an electric.",2.0
"I have owned two of these pumps.  With both pumps, initial performance was awesome, I loved this pump.  Pumps up a queen sized air mattress in seconds, and is able to pressurize it so it's rock hard; I hate squishy air beds.  Plenty of charge for inflating my beds, and another family's beds, and having some fun stoking the camp fire to about the temperature of the Sun.  A lot more power and more run time than the old 4D pump that came with the mattress.

The first of these pumps lasted a couple of seasons I think. There was no sign of the battery having become any weaker, so I was more than a little surprised and disappointed to find it would not take a charge at all after it being put away for the winter.

My local retailer very generously replaced the pump for free, which they didn't have to do since it was ""a bit"" past the 30 day return policy, and even ""a bit"" past the one-year warranty.  So now I had a brand new pump, which was as awesome as the first one had been when it worked.  Except this one died after just ONE season of use. Grrr!

Both pumps died in exactly the same way: they stopped taking a charge. The wall wart to charge them has an LED on it that lights up if any current is being drawn. It does not light up at all, not even dimly. This actually led me to think that the adapter was dead, but in fact, the adapter is OK; putting a load on it the LED lights up, so it's the pump that's not making a circuit. At all.

Even though on average I've gotten only 1 1/2 seasons of use from these pumps, which is pathetic, I can't give them just one star, because when they do work, they WORK.

I've not contacted Coleman, and I may not.  I'm out of warranty, that's it.  I may open the thing up and see what the actual problem is; maybe it's fixable.  I don't see myself buying another one of these pumps though.  And I wouldn't recommend it to others, either.",2.0
"Unit came in what appeared good shape for being used. BUT>>> It DID NOT COME with a charger/powerpack. The pump is of NO USE if it can't be charged. I am hoping the seller will have it and send it and it will be operable. If not this air mattress pump is of no use at all, and I will try for a refund.",2.0
"Worked great for about 3 overnight camping trips, but then just stopped working - no idea why.  Had a manual backup plan, thank goodness!  I won't buy this model again.",2.0
"I bought this thinking it would be great no cords blow stuff up anywhere but got it home plugged it in and the charger light did not come on. I left it plugged in over night and the next morning nothing,so i phoned Coleman and they sent me a replacement part. Got it home plugged it in and same thing so i will have to get a charger and see if it will work.",2.0
"This pump came with my coleman inflatable bed.  I used it to pump up the bed for my guests and got to use it about 10 - 15 times or so before it went completely dead.  It lasted for 3 years but since I only got at most 15 uses out of it, I'm giving it 2 stars.  I guess you get what you pay for.",2.0
"I so wish that I could write a positive review for this pump.  The first time I pulled it out to blow up a kiddie pool with no wires attached, I was ecstatic and singing its praises (I have the feeling that a lot of the positive reviews here are from people who've had it for less than a year).  However, after one winter the pump would not hold a charge.  I purchased a replacement, and it was dead the next year as well.  To add to the problems the pump 1) cannot be used with the charger plugged in (e.g. the pump cannot be operated while charging, so if you have a dead battery it's a paperweight) and 2) uses a proprietary battery that is wired DIRECTLY into the pump (I cracked it open to see if I could swap out the battery myself), and therefore cannot be easily replaced.

I bought a corded pump and run an extension cord out to the pool now.  Not nearly as sexy, but at least I know it will work next summer (I hope).",2.0
"I bought this pump with my second kayak. I used it once to inflate the kayak and it stopped working. Living in a rural area, the cost of returning it for repair or replacement was more than the cost of buying a new one. Use a hand or foot pump; it's cheaper.",2.0
"We purchased two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SEVYLOR-TAHITI-CLASSIC-U235-K79-YELLOW/dp/B0015O2RV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SEVYLOR TAHITI CLASSIC (U235/K79 - YELLOW)</a>&nbsp;for our RV camping trips and the Coleman Rechargeable pump was a recommended item.  Unfortunately the pump does not have enough power to fully inflate the kayak requiring additional manual inflation.  The adapters also do not fit several of the Sevylor fittings so it is difficult to close off the valves without losing air.  We have not selected a replacement pump yet so do not have a recommended pump yet, but this one is not recommended for the job.",2.0
"I have had this pump for a while, and the one feature that I cannot stand about it is that you can't plug it in once it has lost its charge and use it.  You have to actually plug it in and wait until it charges, then use it.  So if it dies (which they often do when sitting idle for more than a few days), you simply cannot fill your air mattress without waiting to it to recharge first (which takes hours and hours, by the way).  It ends up meaning that I have to plan ahead and think to charge this a day before each use, which is a complete pain (and I never remember).",2.0
"I really want to like this board more, and feel I am being generous and fair with the 2 stars. I waited 2 months to write this review to make sure i wasn't being too picky.. But its time to review. First, the board is marketed as self healing, and I don't expect the board to look perfect, but after 2 months, there are a TON of holes, way more than my other board. The board is also rock hard in areas, and was this way the day I took it out of the box, and thought maybe the humidity affected the board in shipment. Nope, even after a few months, the board has areas where the darts bounce out from hitting the harder areas and its not the wires. Maybe I just got a fluke bad board, as I own other Viper products, but I would be cautious in buying this. There are plenty of other options out there, and for a few bucks more, you can get a higher quality board.",2.0
The dart board is nice but the darts all broke after a couple of uses.,2.0
"Yes, its definitely a standard solid dart board. However, my apartment has smelled like mildew since the moment I took it out of the box. Im honestly not a picky person, I never write bad reviews, but this smell is overwhelming.",2.0
"I am very dissatisfied with this product, the darts quality is very poor, they break quickly.",2.0
The numbers are difficult to read and the dart flags keep coming off... Poor quality product,2.0
Ok board. The wires around the bull make for many borrow like bounce outs. Spend the extra on a blade dual core.,2.0
"There were a couple issues I had when installing the board, namely that the center hole for the screw was off center and that the holes for the feet were also not in the right position.  On top of that, the wires are thick, especially the spider so there are lots of bounce outs.  And after about 30 minutes of throwing the board had giant visible holes from the darts with big cracks.  the darts that come with it are as cheap and light as one could expect.  While this might be good for kids or the non-darter, people who are serious about throwing at home should find a better board.  I'm ordering a different one later today.",2.0
The board is cheap quality not sure where it was made but its not self healing!,2.0
Came with everything but does not self heal like advertised. I guess you get what you pay for.,2.0
The price should have been the give away that this board is not that good. From the first dart thrown you could see every hole in the board when you removed the darts. This board will not hold up for long and I will have to rotate the numbers on a regular basis.,2.0
"Dart board is awesome BUT 3 of the darts came broken and was missing 3 of the flights, almost like they knew they were broken when they packaged them. We accidentally ordered two boxes and decided to keep them both the second package one dart arrived broken and missing 1 flight as well. If you're going to order make sure to order extra darts as most of ours from the package were broken.",2.0
Board ok.  Wires popping out all over,2.0
It worked great until the darts wings were breaking off the second day i only have 2 darts instead of 6.,2.0
"Bought it about 2 months ago. 2 of us play every night about 2 hours of play.
Both sets of darts that came with it broke within the first month, but we didn't care since they were ""freebie"" darts.
Next we noticed our darts bounced out every turn, but we figured we needed to adjust to the board. Bouncing out continues though, months later.
The wire is soft so it's all bent from its originial layout.  The cork is also bent in/worn like it's a 5+yr old board at a bar.
We are decent adult players, there is no reason other than poor manufacturing, that explains the shape out board is in.
I will look for a more durable brand next.",2.0
"This board is not good for serious players, lots of bounce out and each throw leaves noticeable holes in board.",2.0
"I bought this board and I received it in bad conditions, it has absorbed moisture, the darts was sticky, and since it clearly has absorbed moisture the fibers are weak. I think the reason it cheap its because they do not keep their stock in good condition.",2.0
Just too heavy - Returned it  - Maybe my fault for not checking the weight,2.0
The number ring keeps falling off and for some reason the bulls eye does not hold the dart,2.0
It's not self healing like the description says. I've only used it twice and there's holes everywhere.,2.0
"iffy quality, but price is cheap too",2.0
The darts did not  last they fell apart,2.0
The dartboard is great but the darts arrived broken and the ones that weren't broken which was two both broke after about the third throw by my kids.. Definitely need to buy better darts..,2.0
"I wasn't too worried about a good old fashioned, wired and stapled dartboard. The sisal bristles do their job nicely. It's packed firmly and I have no fall outs. I play with 21g 80% darts. My only concern with this board is the frequent bounce outs. The bounce outs are caused by the round wires that separate the numbers and form the double, treble and outer bull rings. Yes the bull is staple free so that works as advertised. If the wire is of a harder steel then even sharp darts can deflect off them and continue into the board, but the wire on this Viper is softer. Sharp darts dig into the metal and so do not deflect off. Instead they bounce more readily. The problem resulting from this is two fold. The obvious first point is that the dart has bounced out and your score reflects that. Bummer. However the more annoying second problem is that because the wire is so soft it physically bends a lot more than it should when hit by a dart. After 1 week of play the ends of the wires, (just outside the double ring and where they hook over the outer bull ring), are lifting out of the bristles and moving so the number segments are starting to look uneven. When I hit wires by doubles it is deforming the shape of the double bed and is very distracting. If I have experienced this much deformity of the wire after 1 week, then it doesn't take much thought to imagine how bad it's going to look in a couple of months. Such a shame because the board itself is good, heals well with a nice density but spoiled by the use of cheap, soft wire.
The 2 sets of darts supplied with it are reasonable, comfortable to throw but they are lightweight but not so much that they don't bed into the board.  $26 seemed like an excellent price, but if i have to replace the board that more often then that is false economy. I think I'll invest in a Shot! Bandit board by Puma. Nearly twice the price but I'm sure with it's staple free, embedded razor wire it will last a lot longer than twice the life of this Viper.",2.0
"Not a terrible board but the metal bounds are not all aligned properly. Only a few darts thrown at it, but feel that the board won't have a long life. Have had a decent amount of bounce outs.",2.0
Quality fiber material on the board. Wires are terrible though. They pop out and move around all over the place. Bounce outs all the time. And whenever theres a bounce out the wire actually bends. Im very disappointed with the quality of the wire.,2.0
This is a good cheap board but it uses old technology with thick round wires and large staples. Good for a practice board but not recommended for competition,2.0
this board  seems to attract mold were ever it is used/stored never had a product like it,2.0
"I am fairly new to owning my own dart board but the reviews and what I was told said that this board was good for the price... It is in fact what you pay for, i have played for one full night and have had more than 20+ bounce outs especially when trying to close out the bulls eye or even trying for the triple twenty. The number wire surrounding the board is way off and not even close to being symmetrical, the so called ""healing"" of the board... that is a joke it in no way shape or form heals. I may just have recieved a bad board but the way this is put together i extremely doubt it. I would save my money and get the winmau blade 4 bristle dartboard. it has no staples and it works way better played all night at a friends house and didn't have one single bounce out. I hope this helps out the next person that looks through these reviews, just save your money and get the Winmau.",2.0
I sent it back for a refund. It was supposed to not show dart marks. After a few months it looked as though I've had it for a year and had played it everyday for the same amount of time.,2.0
"Surface all cratered and rough. Bullseye is popped out 1/4"" from rest of board. Dent in side. Number ring warped.. All in all, the quality of this board would have been good if there had not been so many defects in it....Made in China with very poor quality controll.",2.0
"Maybe my dart board is deffective, but it absolutely does not heal any holes at all and after playing for about 30 mins the thing is covered in holes.",2.0
"Bought this set for the holidays. Installation was relatively easy, but required a bit of adjusting to make sure that the board isn't shaking on the wall. Played a couple of times to get a feel. As others stated bounce-offs happen more often than some other boards, but it did not bother us. However, the bounced off darts broke apart the the 3rd time we played. The plastic fly-tips were breaking off the metal tips, making the darts useless. Now we need to replace the darts. What a disappointment.

If anyone can recommend better and more durable darts, I would greatly appreciate that.",2.0
been experiencing a lot of drops and board not really self healing after you removed the pins as they indicate in the description I am returning this item and will get the winmau blade 4 staple free board.,2.0
"The first one was undeliverable as described by Fed-Ex. Amazon kicked butt in taking care of that end of it and promptly sending a replacement. 2 of my darts are broken upon arrival (Make that 3 of the darts now, EDIT 7/4/13). I did not receive the American/British flag flights as pictured, which disappointed my kids. The board looks like it has been used, though I can't say 100%. No instruction on how to install it, just rules for how to play. It is heavy, so make sure you have a really sturdy place to mount it. If I were you, I would check around a little bit more. It may even be worth the extra cash to just buy a good dart board locally. To make sure your darts aren't broken and the board hasn't been used. It really takes a lot for me to give a low rating to something, this item deserves it. The second star is only because of the professional manner in which Amazon handled the undeliverable situation.",2.0
"I've owned this dart board for about 3 weeks, and I'm sending it back. We actually noticed the second day we had it that the board did NOT seem to be self-healing (still had open holes from playing the night before), but we thought maybe we were being too critical. Sure enough, the more we played, the worse the dart board has gotten. It's already riddled with dozens of tiny dart holes that won't close (and yes, we've only used light-weight regulation steel-tipped darts darts & the darts that were included with the board). Now a third of the darts that we throw fall straight out. It was a really fun board for the first week, but it's already falling apart. No darts will stay in the board, no matter how you throw them. My hubby and I went and played on a Winmau board last night, and it definitely cemented out decision to return the shot king. The board that we were playing on was at least 2 years old, and, physically, it looked AMAZINGLY better than our board. (And we were out at a bar playing, so you know that board has been beaten to death.) We didn't have a single dart bounce out or fall out during the game. Done.

Anyway, it's a fun board and looks really nice and professional when you first get it out of the box. However, if you want a board that will stay professional looking or, heck, that you can play on for at least a year... I wouldn't recommend this board at all. Save the money and put it towards a quality dart board.",2.0
"I was so excited after reading all these reviews. A $22 great board. Well, the good thing about the board is just that, the board. It's made of good material and heals nicely.  The metal is way to thick which encourages bounce backs, the color of the numbers are nearly unrecognizable. That's no big deal, I painted mine white.  There was about 1/16 th inch gap between metal and board which ridiculous. It can't simply be re-anchored....because... It was all warped and so something was inevitable to be ""off"".  I gently removed it and took a picture. If I had to do again, I would probably buy the same board. Obviously, I'm one of the unfortunate. Oh, mounting instructions would have helped. 3 nails a few screws and some bracket I had to figure out.",2.0
The color of the wheels are very unpleasant which I am very upset about and the stopper on the front is plastic not rubber. Which is exactly what I didn't want to end up with. Look at a different pair or you will be stuck looking at yucky colored wheels... Im not really happy with the color.. way darker and chalkier almost brown pink then I was expecting.,2.0
"I sent them back.  The wheels don't roll at all.  This would have been good for my daughter learning, but it just didn't seem right that  the wheels didn't spin at all.  I got the purple and white Roller Derby ones instead.  They roll great.",2.0
"We ordered this product in a size 8 and when we received it, it was marked size 8 but it was easily a normal size 10. We had to pay to ship it back and exchange it for a smaller size, when there should have been an advisory that the skates run extremely large.  It cost $19 dollars to ship it back for the exchange in addition to the original cost of the skates plus shipping.  Other than that the skates are true to the description and are very cute.  Therefore the skates actually cost $69 instead of $50 (including shipping).",2.0
They are to dangerous to ride. They have the wheels to close. The front wheels are to close to the back wheels,2.0
I was so disappointed to find that my usual size was too big for these skates. Seems to be a good quality make and heavy duty. Almost too heavy. I will return these and buy something lighter probably.,2.0
I like the shape  but is a beginners roller skates not made for speed . Not happy,2.0
"The skates fit great but we did have to loosen the bolts on the wheels the first time use cause they were too tight and skating was difficult. My daughter loved them and skates 3 days a week at the local skating rink. Unfortunately, the bolts on the wheels will no longer tighten and the wheels are too loose. The skates were functioning for only a couple of months and now she can no longer skate with them because of the loose wheels. I would really like my money back!",2.0
"I can't use it because it is too large.
I bought early for Christmas and now I can't return it anymore.
I wish I could have another size to fit me...",2.0
Im scared to even try to skate in them because they're so big! We shouldnt have to figure out or read up on the fact they run big. They look good though.,2.0
Too big,2.0
Beautiful classic skate but extremely uncomfortable on the back of the ankles.  Bruising occurred.  Had to buy an insert for padding.,2.0
"I bought these skates a couple years back. I went out on them, and I found the wheels inadequate for enjoyable skating. I skated constantly as a youngster, but After trying these out once I gave up and continued rollerblading. This action pays testimony to how unsuitable I found these skates for outside use as Rollerblading is not really my thing. The skates are pretty heavy. In agreement with other reviewers, they are pretty comfortable. As I said, I bought mine a few years back so sizing issues might have changed. I noticed that mi e were a size smaller than my average shoe. I really have this urge to skate. So, I have just spent more, than I paid for the skates, on new wheels & bearings. If you are looking for outside skating, I personally would buy something a little more expensive.",2.0
"After skating all of 4 times, the bearings were dead and needed to be replaced.  The boot is comfortable enough to skate for a bit, however I would suggest getting a better insole insert.  The wheels are not very good either, so when your bearings do go bad, expect to replace them as well as they have a wobble to them.  On one of the boots, the lace catch up towards the top has already bent back as well and will probably break within the next few times of skating.",2.0
The wheels had to be changed because they were cheap and my baby couldn't skate with them on.,2.0
I will not recommend this product. I use it in my car and most of the time is wrong. If you really need a compass you better read all reviews. I usually do it but I couldn't find about this product and well ... lucky it was only a few dollars.,2.0
"I bought it from sears, it worked for 3 month, then stoped, no screen display, changed with new battery, still not working. I gave up.",2.0
These are bigger than a normal size 8.  I wear a 7.5 - 8 in shoe size and these are way too big for me.  These are more like a 9 or 10.  Not sure which.  And they are very UNCOMFORTABLE.  It may be cause they're not broke in or I'm just not used to wearing a boot type shoe.  The top of the boot hurts my leg like I'm getting a blister.  I'm not happy with them.  Now I'm trying to get rid of them.,2.0
"I ordered these skate 2 sizes too small and that size fit perfectly.  They shipped in a decent amount of time.  If you are planning on using these for indoor skating, I would suggest purchasing new, faster wheels.  These were very slow like the old school, plastic, fisher price skates. I also suggest wearing with tube socks because the back of the boot cuts into your heel. 2 stars for the looks and comfort.",2.0
"great condition, the box said the correct size but the shoe itself was a size and a half too big. disappointed but will still wear them.",2.0
Skates are comfortable but the wheels and bearings that come with the skates are JUNK.....Already after three uses had to put in new bearings and wheels are next because they are  very noisy....,2.0
"The skates look wonderful but the wheels suck! We have not figured out a way to contact the seller but you cannot remove the bearings from the wheels (I had a roller derby person try) so the wheels don't want to turn, making it difficult to skate. Maybe a got a bad set of wheels. If I could figure out a contact number maybe this could be remedied but as it stands, I will have to buy new wheels with bearings. I did put a new set of wheels with removable bearings on & they worked fine. The skates look wonderful as do the wheels, but the wheels don't function well. They were shipped in a very timely manner & packaged decent.  I would give a higher rating if I didn't have to switch out wheels. If you are the seller, please put your contact information on the products so a customer can contact you, I have not found any way to contact you!",2.0
Box was destroyed by the time it arrived. Skate ran large so we had to buy a size smaller. Hopefully it will be a good skate by the time she grows into it.,2.0
"My second time wearing the skates at a roller rink, the wheels became so loose and the vibration was soo bad!  I took the skates up, tightened them and started to skate again.  Within 20 minutes, same issue.  I don't know what the part is called.  But its stripped.  I have to locate a replacement part.",2.0
"SKATES RUN BIG. I NEED TO EXCHANGE THEM. BUT,  I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT.",2.0
Not a very comfortable boot. Did not roll very well.,2.0
ok,2.0
"So for my wife's birthday I bought her ""Breath of fresh air"" skates at the local rink, came with her choice of wheel color and for another $30 or so I added color matched laces, wheel nuts, truck cushions and toe stops.  My youngest never was interested in skating but now that Mom is going more often wants a set.  I figure these are OK since she doesn't even like skating that much.  Well now that I bought better bearings, new wheels in her color and toe stops to match, I could have spent an extra $20 and gotten her the same skates I bought her mom, and the boots and truck would have been light years better.  The moral, if you even might start upgrading these, just buy better ones to begin with.",2.0
The wheels don't roll easy I asked a guy at the skating rink to help he said Chicago bad barring.,2.0
One of skate wheel was missing some of the hardware so I will have to replace it  other roller skate is okay.,2.0
"The quality was decent, but the boot was way too small. Also, the wheels were extremely tight and did not roll freely. Not sure how they would be with a persons full weight on them once they got going. I was afraid to get the next size up since other reviews said they ran large. Anyway, the other bummer was since I bought two pairs for my girls, it cost me $35 to ship them back. :(",2.0
"The skates are beautiful, but there's something wrong with my left skate. It doesn't roll as smooth as the right. I tried loosening and tightening the wheels, but that still didn't seem to help.",2.0
"Love the they way they look, and loved the price.  I was so excited to try these new skates.  They do not roll right, and make it very difficult to skate  (I am a pretty good skater too).  They are slow rolling, and require a lot of effort to get and keep any speed at all.  The wheels are very loud on the floor...my son said I sound like a motorcycle coming towards him.  They also catch and pull your feet inward.  I had professionals at the rink make many adjustments, and they are still awful.  They say I need new wheels and bearings. I am very very disappointed.",2.0
"I have only taken my skates to the rink once and I spent the whole time adjusting the wheels and trying to get them to stop making a growling noise.  When there isn't any pressure on the skates the wheels turn smoothly and don't make a noise, but as soon as you start using them they make a noise.  I asked the owners of the rink and they couldn't figure out what was going on.  They thought it might be bad bearings.  I should probably send them back, but wonder if replacing the bearings myself is cheaper than shipping costs.  The boot is comfortable and sizing is close.  I usually wear an eight and a half and after reading other comments decided on a 8 which fit well.  I'm so disappointed, I just wanted to be able to put them on and go.",2.0
"I got these skates for myself! and, I had read the reviews before I ordered it. but, it was mixed reviews! some, were saying, its the right size and others were saying, it was two sizes two big!! and, since, im a positive risk taker  I figured, I,ll  just go for it and order it. all excited to get my skates so, I can go skating with my ten year old daughter. but, when I got them, man, I was so mad!! not only cause, my risk now was an inconvenience for me but, cause, I was really looking forward to go skating with my daughter that weekend! they got here fast and they looked okay? the wheels looked like fisher price wheels cheap!! like if you tried to use them in the street they would crack! and, I grew up skating in the Bronx and I had skates that would glide threw gravel like if it was finished polished wood! point is, they do run big, and the ones that said they fit perfect must be in denial of their actually foot size! ladies if you are a size ten, stop trying to fit into size 8 so your feet won't look huge! be happy you got feet to put your feet into skates! and second wheels look cheap! so, I was glad to had sent them back! and will be looking for better quality skates in near future. as, they say, you get what you pay for!!",2.0
"I was so excited to get these skates - sounded perfect for a returning skater.  But when I received them the back wheels were improperly mounted and the entire piece wobbled.  The bolt was bad and would not move so I could readjust the wheels correctly.

The skates were nice looking and comfortable.

Amazon's return service was easy to use and my refund was prompt.  No complaints at all there.

I chose not to reorder but instead when to my local pro shop and purchased a pair that I could see before buying",2.0
"Great price/product relationship. Very good quality components. A bit bigger than expected. Overall, I think it was an excellent choice.

I purchased this item as new and mailed directly to my granddaughter. They arrived scuffed and rollers worn as if they had been used. Also one missing shoe lace,2.0
The skates are too stiff and too hard.... And the heal in way too hight for skating. I ordered a 6 and im normally a 7 it fit good but the stiffness of it does not help.,2.0
"looking for low cost beginner skates - you found it.
plastic wheels - hard to turn.
really run large - be careful, if you order wrong amazon will charge you for shipping, they don't seem to work with you if you wanted to exchange for smaller size even though on the front page not warning of how sizes run ( you get a refund then have to order again)(shouldn't have to read reviews to find out they run large)

"These skates were super cute, but they were too heavy for me, and that made them uncomfortable for me to wear. They were a little long, so they were too big for me. I usually wear a size 10 though. Not sure what socks would be best, since they are narrow as well. The leather that rests on your calf dug into my skin.

I ended up returning them because it was really bought on a whim purchase.",2.0

"This is a good trigger lock, don't get me wrong. But it doesn't work on the AR platform.
  It looks secure at first glance, but notice how it doesn't cover the pin that releases the trigger guard?
  That alone renders this this lock worthless for an AR. If you can press the pin, you can remove this lock.",2.0
"Simply put these locks are not very secure. Easily defeated via non-destructive and destructive methods. Not to mention one of the locks I received was defective. The cylinder ended up being upside down, with the pins on the same side as the warding in the lock. I have no idea how this happened, but the lock is stuck in the open position.",2.0
"these locks are inexpensive for a reason:  they are not easy to lock together in an unmovable position; but if you are using them to satisfy a vehicle transportation regulation (I live in MA) then they do the job; however, that being said, they protrude significantly on the non-keyed side which prevents them from being stored easily in most cases.",2.0
My Mom bought these a few years ago when she got mad about me and my friend taking our pellet gun into the woods to get squirrels. She stopped using this a while ago but i remember when they were on i could still fully operate the pellet gun(which is a full size expensive rifle) as well as shoot it. The trigger lock still impeded the trigger pull but did not stop it. I'm not sure if my pellet gun is an oddity but if this is true on other guns it could be a huge hazard. Keep in mind it was only a pellet gun but it is built like a rifle(walnut stock and steel components) and nearly 12 pounds so not just a toy.,2.0
Does not seem to fit my Smith & Wesson MP 380 Body Guard.,2.0
"On all three of my guns (an HK USP .45 Expert, Remington 870 Express Magnum, and Sig Sauer 716) I was able to activate the trigger and fire the gun with the lock on the weapon. The bar that goes through the trigger guard is too fat to fit behind the trigger, so the only way to get the lock on the gun at all is in front of the trigger. No matter how snug you get the lock, a little effort can slide it backwards and the bar activates the trigger.",2.0
"Fits my shotgun very well, very tight and secure.  Not so on my pistol, cannot make it fit on the trigger guard.",2.0
"I needed 6 locks.  I have used Master padlocks for years and trusted them, so I bought two sets of three.  I couldn't find how to get all six keyed alike, but that wasn't a big problem.
When they arrived, I opened one set and they seemed substantial and adequate to keep my grandchildren from getting into trouble.  I opened the second set of three and they seemed, at first, to be secure.  On a whim, I decided to try the keys from the first set on the second set of locks.  I accidentally found that I could open all three locks from the second set by only inserting a key, ANY KEY, about 1/8"" into the cylinder I could lock and unlock these units.  I repeated the experiment over and over with no problem -  and no security.

Anybody could unlock these with any tool that goes part way in, not even contacting the locking pins. (For what it's worth, if you insert a key all the way in, only the correct keys will open and close these locks.)

In case I was missing something, I read the instructions very, very carefully.  They say:
{quote}  1. INSERT key and turn to the right (clockwise).  SEPARATE both halves of gun lock. REMOVE key from lock.  MAKE SURE GUN IS UNLOADED AND NOT COCKED!
2. INSERT front lock unit (section with the key hole) with ratchet post positioned through the trigger guard, behind the trigger if possible.
3. INSERT rear unit, with outside edges of both units matching.  Note that self-adjusting pins usually permit lock to be installed in more than one position.
4. After determining best lock position, PRESS the two units together.  MAKE CERTAIN that the lock is tight and cannot be moved after it is installed.  If it can be, lightly press units together until immovable or try other positions. {End Quote}

Notice that there are no instructions telling you to lock this unit.  They say unlock it, separate the halves and remove the key!!  It is very easy to remove the key while in the unlocked position.  The two halves will go together whether locked or not.
Not everybody is clever enough to realize that they must take another step and turn the key into the locked position before mating the two halves. I think Master might be liable if somebody gets hurt by a gun using one of their locks.

Since I have a fifty-fifty chance of getting a good replacement set, I am returning both sets of locks and buying another brand.  My grandchildren's safety is at stake.  I am very disappointed in the Master Lock Company.",2.0
These locks are decent for what I need them for. It secures the trigger like it supposed to but the spring loaded nubs that surround the center locking mechanism is cheap and can fall out where the function of those are questionable in preventing the lock from shifting that the trigger of the gun may be freed while still on the gun? May want to look into another alternative.,2.0
"Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.

However, on my two lever-action rifles, it's not very effective -- probably no surprise, given the design. On an older Winchester 94, I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together, with some effort. On a Winchester 9422, it attaches itself to the trigger guard, and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used. The rifle can be loaded, cocked, and fired with the lock still in place.",2.0
"The seat is surprisingly narrow. I'm a slender woman, and my hips are bigger than the seat. I'd order something else if I could be sure it would be wider, but that doesn't seem to be in the specs.

Watch face dicolored.  The watch band has been cut and readjusted.  Battery was low and back light is very dim.,2.0
"I bought this watch a little over 4 years ago because of its features and looks.  It's not as ridiculously bulky as most other watches with a barometer/altimeter, so you can wear it as your everyday watch without looking like a dork.

At first I found the LCD display to be a little faint, but I got used to it.  The time, backlight, stopwatch, alarms, thermometer, barometer, and altimeter work very well, but the compass (Suunto's supposed strength) crapped out on me within the first year.  It seemed to get stuck so that you couldn't have the sensor go around the full 360 degrees to calibrate.  The warranty is something lame like 30 days, so I just let it go.

Just like everyone else has reported, the band broke every year and a half no matter how good I was to it.  The replacements are expensive (~$30-50).  Over the past few months, the display started to malfunction every now and then, but would come back to normal after a while.  Recently it died for good - hence I'm writing this review.  Part of me thinks it may have lost its waterproofness because this happened at the beach and I always used to worry about the plastic battery cover that seems to belie the solidness of the stainless steel case.  However, the glass never got steamed up so I guess I'll never know.

Anyway, I'm disappointed that this $300 watch ($380 including replacement bands) only lasted 4 years.  I give Suunto points for a nice design, but dock them some for poor workmanship.",2.0
"The watch looks great and has all the features I wanted in a sleek size (for the features it has at least).  All the features seemed to work as advertised, though the temperature only works well when you aren't wearing the watch.

I had two reasons for the low review.  First, the user interface seems overly complicated.  I rarely could figure out how to do anything other then switch screens on this watch without the manual.  I've owned other feature full watches before and this was the hardest to use.  Second, the band sucks.  The first two years I had it the band broke twice and it uses a custom band so you have to pay $$ to get another one, just to have it break again.  After the 2nd time it broke I threw it to the back of the drawer in digest.  I will not put more money into it.",2.0
Not a huge fan because it's not totally secure. I'll do more test rides but so far I don't feel I can leave my watch on.,2.0

"You need to push a button near the bar in front in order to play the music. Keep in mind you must push it while the ride is going. Quite annoying. My 10 month old is just bored by it. From the start, he would just stare at me as it went in a circle and yawn. It was so ""thrilling"" that he fell asleep on it twice.  Other children in the neighborhood (from 7 months to 2 years) have ridden it and also not liked it at all. To be blunt, I could not even give it away. For people interested in buying it, I would suggest waiting and getting the Perego train.",2.0
"I bought this for my then one year old.  She is tall and into everything, no fears whatsoever, so I thought great toy.  In my opinion, it just goes too fast for smaller kids.  She would scream hysterically and want off.  Even today, she's 2 now and will ride rides at amusement parks, chucky cheese, but is still scared to death of the coaster.  I also think part of it is because it's very loud when it runs.  I'm not talking about the music, the coaster itself is loud and then it runs fast.  On the other hand, it's very durable.  I myself took a couple of spins around on it and it did great.  Very fast to put together or take apart.",2.0
"The first one lasted a day, one day and when it fell out of my hand while I was passing it to someone to wear, it D-I-E-D.
The second one (totally great return policy Amazon!) was taken care of as if it were fragile crystal. It lasted 6 weeks before it also found it timely demise upon hitting the floor.
I think the concept is remarkable, the tool itself is fabulous, it really does count steps with great accuracy, but it is not durable at all.  I am sadly disappointed.",2.0
"Pros: it's really cheap, and has a lot of features (set stride length, calories, clock, backlight, protective door)

Con: the door is really, incredibly, intolerably hard to open.  I was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open.  I tried to trim the plastic tab, but I took too much off, now the door flops open.  It was useless the way it came from the factory, now I broke it and can't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed.

Also, I was never able to get a very accurate step-count.  I would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout, though I'm not really sure because I had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open.

For the price, I think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it.",2.0
"Unlike another reviewer whose review I read, I found this pedometer to be inaccurate.  It indicates many more steps than I actually take and is off by over a tenth of a mile in distance walked.  I was especially disappointed when I learned that a friend and his fiance had purchased a different pedometer (for the same price as I paid for this one) that records their steps and distance travelled extremely accurately, even though they are completely different in height/weight characteristics.  Moreover, theirs has a ""talking"" feature which tells them how many steps they have taken, etc. And, it looks nicer, with a black and silver case.",2.0
"I ordered this product because of the great reviews that I read about it online. Once it was delivered, however, I was extremely disappointed with the purchase. First of all, I find it very hard to open. It requires a lot of force and is even more awkward to open when it is placed on a waistband (versus just holding it in your hands). I was also surprised that, not only is there no way to turn it off- it is constantly on and wasting batteries, but after leaving it on my dresser overnight I woke up to find out that it had walked 27 steps on its own while I was sleeping! Pretty amazing, huh? I am very disappointed in this product and surprised by all of the other reviews. Hopefully this one is just defective!",2.0
"Well I was all ready to give this product a decent review but ends up it isn't worth it. It is hard to open but I can live with that. Some of the buttons are not that responsive as you can't flip back and forth from distance to steps to calories that easy. It seems not to like that very much. However it was doing the job. I tested it out several times and it was only off by a couple of steps on each test. On average though it was very accurate. No phantom steps and no counting while i was sitting. I would test 100 steps at a time and it came within 1-5 steps. This made me happy as  this is what I bought it for. So why only 2 stars? Well as soon as it reached 1000 steps the readout went extremely dim. I switched modes and it was fine but when I went back to steps it was dim again. I reset it to 0 and it was ok again. I ran a few tests and each time it went over 999 it dimmed out to a point where I couldn't tell what the numbers were. did I walk 2340 steps or 3246 steps? Now that is a big difference. Now put that big issue with the smaller ones and this product just doesn't cut it. Too bad because it was accurate, light, and compact. I'm taking it back and trying another product. With all the other bad reviews the chances of you picking a good one looks 50/50. This company has to really look at this product because selling something with a track record like this is not right.",2.0
"I threw it out the window, ran over it with my car, beat it with a hammer, put it down the garbage grinder and it just will not cease to exist.  Sure, it doesn't work anymore... but it never did!  The thing would add a hundred steps if I just looked at it the wrong way.  If I actually tried to use it while walking, it informed me that I had travelled to the moon and back while driving over to get a take-out pizza.  Listen, a lot of reviewers seem to be excusing the shabbiness of the product by extolling its price.  In that case, yeah, the rock I found on the beach doesn't keep very good time but you can't beat the price!  I mean listen, people, if you are happy with a pedometer mostly because you paid little for it, you need to admit that you are just a cheapskate.  If you are not interested in accuracy, why measure at all?  And pedometers are notoriously inaccurate, despite what their manufacturers would have you believe.  For one thing, you can blow me with that stride length malarkey.  A person's stride length is in a state of flux and is especially not well represented by the stiff, self-conscious steps you take when you are trying to determine your stride length.  Ever hear of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, baby doll?  Well, I don't wanna get too technical on you.  The whole pedometer concept is for the birds, you dig?  If you cheapskates are serious about measuring distance, why don't you open that wallet that makes a sound like a creaking door in an old horror movie and bats fly out of it and once you have cleared away the cobwebs, take out your credit card and place an order for a Polar or Nike SDM.  That's Speed and Distance Monitor.  These are accurate to 97% even without calibration.  But, oh, prepare yourself for a coronary:  they cost a little more than the pedometer you got at McDonalds with your Happy Meal.  Sorry.",2.0
"The price of this product is what sold me comparing to other pedometers.  I bought it being aware of the problems other reviewers have stated.  The ""happiness"" ratio seems about 40% at best.  The thumb clip has been problematic but you can work around it.  But is that what you want in a product?  The biggest flaw I have found is in its accuracy. After several tests of 50 steps the unit averaged being ""off"" by being over 40 steps...on the lowest sensitivity.  Disappointing.  I wouldn't mind it being off by being under because I would exercising more and thats good.  But this way I feel like its cheating me at the cost of my health.  I will continue to use this unit but I will be on the lookout for a new unit.  I can not make a recomendation for this product.",2.0
"It was great at tracking my steps, it was great at taking my pulse very easily, and it stayed securely to my waist.  However, after about a month, the battery cover came off unbeknownst to me.  So the unit is useless now.  The only other problem I had with it was that the cover was extremely stiff to open.  If I wanted to check my steps, I would usually think twice because it was a major event to try and open it.
Now I need a new one, and I'm not sure I'll buy another one of these....",2.0
"When I began to get serious about getting back in shape, I read the usual assortment of exercise books. They all emphasized the need to exercise in the aerobic zone (typically defined as being between 60% and 85% of your age adjusted maximum safe heartrate) if you want to burn fat. I was never very good at taking my pulse and figured that this little gadget would be the perfect tool to check my heartrate, especially since I was planning to do a lot of walking, where the pedometer would come in handy. One problem: I can get a pulse reading about 1 in 5 tries with this. Maybe it's me; my hands are probably a little more callused than average, but it's not like I earn my living with my hands. I've tried different fingers (my ring finger seems the most reliable) and holding it in different positions (flat against a table or my leg helps), but getting a pulse reading before my heartrate drops is still an iffy proposition. I've since learned to take my pulse with my wristwatch and have managed to lose 25 pounds without the help of this gadget. I did try the pedometer function and it seemed reasonably accurate if I set the sensitivity switch to the least sensitive position. However, even in this position it over counted my steps by a few percent. Maybe it will work for you, but be aware that it won't necessarily work for everyone.",2.0
"While I found the device fairly accurate - the hinged back broke over after about 3 months (just when the warranty runs out) it is plastic and on the flimsy side. I will check first, when I replace this.
Without the proper mounts on the back, the device is essentially worthless.",2.0
"I have had the deluxe injector for several years and also have had it develop a crack where the needle mounts onto the plastic. I don't know if hand washing would eliminate the cracking that I and others have experienced. This makes it difficult to get much marinade into anything since the ""seal"" is broken. A stop gap is to put your finger over part of the crack.
For a while I used less expensive injector syringes but found the black rubber gasket deteriorated if I used a dishwasher and in order to really clean the gasket you have to remove the gasket from the plunger.  After a while I found the gaskets would not stay attached to the plunger.  I don't know if hand washing would have eliminated this problem.
More important, the inside of the diameter of the needle is smaller on the cheaper units than the Williams deluxe unit making it difficult to draw up and inject marinades where the spices are not all fine powders.  The one ounce capacity of the Williams unit is a definite plus.
In both types of injectors I found a small amount of cooking oil made a big difference in the ease of moving the plunger up and down.
What now?  I may try a stainless steel unit or a squeeze bottle next depending on the size of the needle and construction quality.  Worst case, another of the Williams Deluxe Marinade Injectors.",2.0
Needle will NOT stay on!  Nothing to hold it to the injector body!  E-mailed manfacturer but never received a response.,2.0
it worked.....not the best quality built piece.  I'd use this as a one-off but not if I was a serious BBQ'er,2.0
The rubber o ring on the inside does not fit properly.  This lets the fluid leak back up in to the tube and out the top.  It makes for a big mess.,2.0
"I'm going to throw my lot in with the people who are not recommending this product. It's the perfect size and just what I wanted.  I give it two stars because when it was working, it was exactly what I wanted. It's small enough that you can get good targeted injections, unlike some of the huge stainless ones. However, the plastic cracked after just a few months rendering it useless. I don't know about you, but I prefer things to last at least a bit longer than a few months. I didn't even use it more than two or three times. Complete junk.",2.0
"I used my Cajun Marinade Injector a total of maybe a dozen times and it really did do a great job.... until I went to use it the other day only to have marinade squirt all over through a crack in the plastic cylinder. Disappointing to say the least. I gave it two stars because before it broke, it worked great. Having read multiple reviews citing the same problem, I know now that the cylinder failure I experienced is a common problem with this model. I was happy enough with the injector performance that I'll consider spending the extra $10 to get the model with a metal cylinder.",2.0
"This injector works great for a few times, but then cracks, not allowing you to suck-up the marinade or inject it. This was only hand-washed after every use.  Don't waste your money on it; you will pull it out to use it, and will not be able to when you need it [like when you have that big turkey sitting on the counter, and find the injector unusable].  The acrylic body needs to be redesigned and manufactured with another, more durable material, then it would be absolutely great.",2.0
"This watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood', but I am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter - it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather.

I was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible - certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve - and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch-prone. I cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for, even if the altimeter worked correctly.",2.0
"At first glance (over the web) this watch looks like the bees knees. But it doesn't have the quality feel I would expect for the price, especially the band. (mine is titanium)
The other big problem I had is that you can't ""hack"" it to another timepiece. When you reset the seconds, it will tick from 00 to 01 seconds almost immediately, as the reset only zeroes the ""whole"" seconds, and not partial seconds.
My $14.95 Coleman watch from Target functions as you would expect - when you reset to the top of the minute it is REALLY the top of the minute and 01 seconds comes exactly 1 second later.
For someone who needs a precision timepiece, I think it crazy that a $500 watch has such a basic design flaw.
I'll probably return it, I'm quite disappointed.
Glenn",2.0
"I love the design, weight etc, but what an expensive toy.  The altimiter works sporadically, and often tells me I am 500' below sea level.  I've read the directions many times but the watch seems to have a mind of it's own.  The compass works well, but the barometer is also inaccurate.
I wanted a turnkey watch, not something I needed to fiddle with every time I used it.  Also, the clasp comes loose often, and if you need to get anything repaired, buy ticket to Finland...",2.0
This seat cover fell a part very quickly.  Go with a better quality seat cover.,2.0
It's better than the bare seat but not :(,2.0
"When I opened it up I thought I would be getting a cushy seat cover, instead its a very VERY THIN seat cover, its not for me its for my sister for her birthday but it really looks cheap and feels/looks very very thin.  I wish I would have researched it a bit better before buying but now I have it and will be giving it to her for her birthday even though I would prefer a different one.",2.0
Not a good product-- hurt my butt MORE when I used it and sat on it. Would not recommend. Also a bit bulky; when you take it off your bike (so people don't steal it) it's not that easy to fit into your carrying bags.,2.0
"This seat cover is pretty thin, improving the comfort of the ride in a pretty marginal way.  Also, the seams are loose and the gel insert beneath the nylon is completely visible after one 60-minute spin class.  Save your money, folks and look elsewhere.",2.0
"I had earlier purchased a Bell Gel Contour Bicycle Seat Cover (""Bell Gel Fusion+"") (which is ASIN # B00069NW2I) from the local Fred Meyer department store, and had been fairly satisfied with it.

For some reason, this time I ordered online the plainer and simpler looking Bell Gel Base Bicycle Seat Cover (""Bell Gel Fusion"") (which is ASIN # B00005OKZ7).  It is surprisingly bad, relatively to the former.  Much less comfortable, and you can feel the seam at the edge after riding for a while.  Not worth saving $5.

Not all the reviews seemed fair or accurate to me, but this really is a far inferior product compared to the competition.

It's better than nothing, of course.",2.0
"Bought in June.  Used an average of twice a week for 20-30 min each use.  The seat started showing signs of wear within the first two or three uses, but it was still usable.  Now in February it has fallen apart.  The seams finally gave and the gel is oozing out.

Gave it two stars because I did get some use out of it and it was comfortable while it lasted.  But, it's not nearly as durable as my last Bell gel seat, which saw more use each week and still lasted a couple of years.",2.0
"While the cover fit well around the seat, it did not stay put.  It shifted to one side more than the other AND the gel oozed out after only riding my bike for 2 days.  I went to my local bicyle shop and they gave me a completely new SEAT (not cover) for my bike.  It is made of foam which is so much better in so many ways.  Don't waste your $ on this seat cover!  Go with foam!",2.0
"I bought this seat cover to reduce the hardness of my original seat to my hybrid bicycle.  After only two days of using this cover, the stitching began separating on the stretch material which goes around the perimeter of the seat.  I returned the product for a credit ... not worth the price.",2.0
"I bought it not for softening my saddle. The fact is I have a Selle SRL Titanium saddle in red color and I wanted something to use as a cover to preserve this expensive saddle during I transport my bikes or when I have to ride in very muddy conditions. So I bought this product purely as a ""cover"" and I didn't make much research on this item, supposing that ""any will fit""

First of all, I was very unpleasantly surprised by the weight of this product. It is unreasonably heavy, very heavy. It is made very big just to be more universal and fit more saddles, but its not the best idea. If you apply it on narrow saddle, than you cant fix this cover at all. It moves and slips all the time. Fixing strand is another bad idea. In fact, I can't find any positive point in this product thus I can't recommend it. Don't waste your money!",2.0
"I really liked this seat cover, it works great on my Giant spin cycle, however I bought it in mid April and haven't ridden my bike more than about 25 times since (unfortunately), but it already has started to come apart at the seam.  It started opening in the back and now the side is splitting and the gel is oozing out.  I wrote the seller to see if I could get a replacement, hoping it is defective or a fluke thing.  If that's the case, I would be otherwise happy with the cover.  In case you're wondering, I'm not obese and it was normal wear and tear/riding of the spin cycle, so this cover should have held up.",2.0
"I weigh close to 240 and started using this in late July.  i found this seat to be good, but the fabric on it has already ripped",2.0
"This seat cover is very comfortable, but if your saddle is not the same size as the cover then the sides will wear thin quickly and the gel will seep out.

Within 2 weeks the gel started to come out the sides.",2.0
"I had a little trouble getting this saddle cover to fit tightly, it took some effort to get the ties real taught and to cross tie them under the seat.  It worked pretty well for a while, but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material.  That was it, it was ruined.  It lasted one season of riding.  Felt good when it worked.  It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat.  After a good season of riding i didn't need it any more, the standard saddle is fine.",2.0

This is not that good of a mirror and the arm adjustment is weak and wants to return to its original position. Also it is a curved mirror so you don't get a good perspective of how far a car is behind you and at night very difficult top see what is coming up on you. Suggest a flat mirror.,2.0

You will not do much for your legs at all.",2.0
Good price - Fast delivery - Electronics part broken before or during shipping - DVD doesn't include promissed assembly instructions - Work days and can't call their help line.  Seems to be a neat unit - quiet to run and easy to assemble.,2.0
"I was lucky enough to use this over a period of a few weeks while at my mother's house.  It does not provide an aerobic workout compared to a treadmill or an elliptical.  There is very little resistance.  It is squeeky.  The movements are jerky compared to an elliptical.  It take sup a lot of space.  I found no value to it since it didn't get my heart rate up, it wasn't working any muscles, and it didn't provide a core work out.  Not sure what the purpose would be.  I am not a very aerobically fit person and can easily work up a sweat on other equipment within a few minutes so not getting an aerobic workout here really says a lot.  So, I don't even think that this is a good machine for beginners.

On the positive side, all of the grandchildren love to swing on it and play on it.  (that probably isn't a positive for my mother though).  The kids think it is fun.",2.0
"It's pretty easy to put together, i had help. The bars do start to squeek not long after using it. The CD it comes with does make you sweat, but i wish it had resistance options, cause like the name ""Free-style"" it just glides along too easily. I do regret purchasing it, but the kids enjoy playing on it, cause it's like a swing. :-)",2.0
"At 1st it seemed great.  It was a fun workout.  I didn't lose much weight though which was my goal.  It just seemed to tone my legs.  at 1st its padded piece came off, but no big deal.  Then the entire foot piece broke off where it has been glued. So my dad used bolts to put it on there. Two months later the cable on the side snapped.  It is just going to end up falling apart on you.",2.0
It is great to hung clothes in the bedroom but this machine doesn't help too much with the workout since is not hard and will bore you quickly. The two handles for the hands are really nice to hang your clothes when you get tired after a couple weeks.,2.0
"I've had this out of the box for a grand total of 10 minutes, but I am not impressed.  I was just about to buy another one here on Amazon but then realized I should check this out first.  Boy, am I glad I did!  There are no instructions beyond the ""Automatically inflates in 10 seconds"" on the box, but when I opened the valve, I saw almost no difference whatsoever in the thickness of this pad.  I kept opening the valve further and further, checking again and again for more instructions in case there was another step, but to no avail. It is maybe 3/4"" thick except in the little circles where the front adheres to the back, and apparently, this is as cushy as it gets?  I guess it will be ok for our type of summer camping, but we will still have to be sure the kids are on flat smooth ground.  This isn't enough to make up for any branches under the tent, that's for sure. I won't be buying another as it is no different than the 1/2"" or 3/4"" foam pads you can buy for $6.99.",2.0

"This is a nice tent for warmer weather, consider other options if you use it in cold weather.  The plastic skylights became very brittle and cracked after 2 uses in 40 degree weather, resulting in a very wet night.

"This is a classic example of purchasing something based on, we grew up using one of these, without really thinking about it.

"I have owned Coleman Propane stove in the past.  This was given as a gift, and the quality was so poor I insisted on sending it back. The hinges on the ""wings"" from the top were bent and the metal flashing under the burners was not installed correctly, making for VERY sharp sheet metal edges on one side. The unit itself was very unstable and therefore making it a hazard.  Living in an hurricane area that is all electric we wanted a camping stove for loss of power. NOT this one. Returning!",2.0

The first one that showed up was assembled completely wrong. Sheet metal was bent all out of shape and wasn't properly folded into the edges of the stove (some Chinese sweatshop worker must of been sleeping on the job...). I sent it back. The replacement was assembled properly. However, it is very clear that Coleman has ""cheapened up"" their stoves since the early 90's. Everything just feels flimsy compared to my original stove.",2.0
Knobs for burners are impossible to set  for desired flame value!! It will be probably reason for me to return it! Do not buy it!,2.0
"I am disappointed that I cannot return this stove. I did not know that I only had a month to return it. The burners on this stove cannot be regulated for a lower temperature. When you light it, the burners go to the highest temp. When I tried to turn the burners down, within in a minute they would go back to the high temp and burn my food. The knobs for the burners do not work to regulate the flame, there is no low setting. When you put it on low it does not stay there, it quickly goes back to high. I tried to tape the knob in the low position with duct tape, but that did not work. If I needed to use low which was often, I had to stand there and hold the knob so it didn't go back up. Very frustrating and burned some food before I could catch it. I would definitely NOT buy this again. Sad, because I had a old Coleman stove just like it that worked great but lost it, so I bought this one to replace it. Poor quality stove....really not functional.",2.0
"We have several of these in our Scout troop and they do get used a lot, but the regulators are NOT durable and the valves require constant maintenance.  Comparing this stove to the original Coleman white gas stove is like night and day.  The old Coleman stoves just worked - all the time - for decades.  I still have one that is 40+ years old and it works like a champ - yes I've repaired it - ONCE.  On this propane stove, I could live with the valves being somewhat non-adjustable, but the regulator system is unique to this stove and converting it to something more durable isn't worth the effort or cost.  The regulator isn't designed to be repairable although we had a few non-operating ones and I was able to salvage one good unit from two. If you only use this a couple/three times a year, you can't beat the price, but if you use them a lot, I'd recommend spending another $40-$50 to upgrade to something more durable and save the hassle of having to replace the regulator and work on the valves.",2.0
"We used this for a short camping trip.  The flame control was not much use.  From all the way on to low was about a sixteenth of a turn, if that much.  Hard to lower to a simmer, without it going out.  Very poor.  Other then that a good stove.",2.0
The stove is great and I've always gotten this kind but for some reason the dials do not go very low at all. I try to turn it down to let food simmer but the knobs won't stay low on their own.,2.0
"You really want to love this stove.  It's a Coleman, so it's neither pretentious nor fragile.  BUT, as other reviews state, the temperature control on this model is horrible.  There is very little flow regulation, so the options are either low (hot), or high (re-entry hot), and the adjustment between the two temps is (for my grill) about a 5 degree difference in turn.  Your steaks will be raw on the inside and scorched on the outside.

This will be replaced by another model that has better temperature control.",2.0
I am very much so not happy with this stove. There is only high and off. You can adjust it lower with only an 1/8 of inch of it turning off. Lame!,2.0

"This stove arrived with a bent/off-kilter burner, dysfunctional side wind-blocker things, and a dent in the corner.

Now, none of those things by themselves would actually bother me too much: the dent would happen eventually anyway, the burner could be tweaked and straightened, and the wall hinges could be made to work (although not very well).

But the overall quality is just awful. This is low-cost garbage profiteering on an old reputation.",2.0
Controls are very in- precise. From off to max in in a quarter turn. Difficult to control heat.,2.0
"Bought to replace an aging almost-identical Coleman grill, and didn't notice that this version lacks the built-in ignition system found in the prior model. The grill design itself is unchanged so I imagine it functions as well as the old one, but I will be returning it because the old model's built-in ignition was too convenient to give up.",2.0

the flame control is awful worse than any camping stove I have ever owned.  We purchased this because are old one was getting hard to connect the gas and wanted to play it safe.  I suggest people just skip this one.

to get the flame low one needs to turn the nob to almost 12 oclock,  one millimeter too far and it is off one too little and it is full power.  JUST CHEAP LAZY JUNK.",2.0
"Heat control is inadequate. The stove needs more precision gas control knobs. It is good for boiling water, cooking bacon, but very difficult making pancakes because the temperature is either high or shuts off.",2.0
Is good if you like cooking with a blow torch.  Trouble setting and keeping low heat...,2.0
"I'm a long-time camper and have several of these classic Coleman propane stoves.  Recently, one of ours was left behind, so I purchased this one as a replacement.  The Coleman stove is such a classic simple well functioning appliance that in my mind it starts out at 5 stars by historical performance standards.  So how did this get to 2 Stars??  Here we go.... Exterior Redesigned: Handle has been eliminated and is now integrated into the steel casing.  Works pretty good, easy to grip, won't deteriorate like a plastic handle might; although mine never did after over 30 years.  I used to run a strap through the handle to group units together for travel... you can no longer do this.  Not a deal breaker for me - still at 5.  Lid still opens with a similar pull down clasp, lid becomes wind breaker and firewall.  Side flaps fold nicely into lid and have a multi-stop-point adjustable tether clip to allow for individual width adjustment of each side. Similar to former models - allows you to use up to a 12"" pan while still staying fairly centered on the burner.  I'd estimate you could use a 9 or 10"" pan simultaneously. I used a 6"" coffee pot on the second burner and there was room to spare.  The pressure regulator/ gas feeder valve would fit snugly for storage and transport into the base on all my former models.  On this new model it just flops around no matter how you put it into the mounting hole.  This leaves it flopping around while carrying and in transport which could potentially damage the mesh on the burners and just generally bang everything up inside.  -1star
Burners - my biggest point of contention is the new burner design / function. Lighting: Burners lit up quickly, but flame is very high at a low setting so use caution - no deduction. Whatever ""PerfectFlow(TM) technology"" provides, it is NOT consistent performance,  I could NOT get this stove to simmer food or keep our coffee pot hot but not boiling.  There was no wind on multiple occasions when I was using the stove.  When trying to adjust the flame downward it would immediately jump back up a little when I released my fingers from the adjustment knob. -2 poor function  Loud: I'm not sure if the ""PerfectHeat(TM) technology"" for more efficient cooking with less fuel is what causes this stove to be soooo loud that I moved it away from conversation area, or if it has to do with the higher ""20,000 total BTUs of cooking power"", But this stove HISSSSSSES so loud that I was annoyed while cooking and trying to hold a conversation with others.  -1 star
So, if you've been following along, we should be at 1 star... but it functions, it's sturdy, it cooked my food, the valve was tight and didn't leak gas, so I'd have to say it's a 2 star minimum for something that actually still functions safely at some level.
I have returned this stove.  Stay tuned for review of whichever stove I get as a replacement.
This was a straight purchase - I was not compensated or discounted for this review.
Photo is my darling husband at the stove and the Coleman Pack-Away Kitchen, which we absolutely love.",2.0
"Trying to adjust the flame level was a challenge. One side of the stove was a challenge.  No high, medium or low options. Had to eye the flame height.",2.0
The stove I bought didn't work. Returned it.,2.0
"No ability to adjust the flame. It either operates on full blast or its off.  Perfect, if you're looking for something to burn your morning eggs with. It also lacks an igniter, so you have to reach directly into the propane stream to light it. If the cover were 1/4"" deeper a griddle could fit nicely inside it when closed up. Which would be a nice feature, but it doesn't so scratch that idea. Nothing like my old Coleman camp stove, should have kept that one...",2.0
You get what you pay for but I was hoping for a bit more with the Coleman brand.  Structurally this little stove seems sound but mine has impossible to control dials.  your gas is either full blast or off.  Spend a little more and get a lot better.,2.0
"I needed a camp stove to replace an old dual fuel stove.  It's built well for it's price and is easy to setup and put away. This model doesn't have an ignition system so matches it is.  Like others have stated it's very difficult to maintain a simmering flame.  The slightest turn, shuts the burner down, it can be done but it's a very touchy proposition.  I think overall you are probably better off spending a bit more to get one with an igniter and better control knobs.",2.0
"It works for cook,  you can't graduate the flame,  or is super hit or is off,  I can't cook on low if I want it.",2.0
"The knobs to control tempature don't work, it's either on and burning, or off.",2.0
"I was online looking for a replacement for this ""perfect flow"" propane Coleman stove.  I can't believe the stars this thing is showing.  I have had mine for 5 years and have finally given up.  As stated by other reviews,  the lid catches on the base heat shield every time while opening.  This just lends credence to the cheaply Chinese made sheet metal construction.  The real heart of the issue with this stove is the flow control.  It is impossible to provide a low heat for precise temperature control.  The burner is only 1"" from your pan.  Everything I put on it burns.  I purchased an iron burner skillet to distribute the heat but this only creates hot spots just over the burner.  I tried putting spacers between the grates and rectangular skillet, etc.  I now have five kids and usually tent camp once a month.  This stove isn't allowing me to be the cool I am at home.  After pounds of burnt bacon and a many egg I quit.  As a consumer I am disappointed in this product.
I did give it two stars for its ability to boil water.",2.0
"Coleman used to make the best stuff back when I was a kid. Not so much anymore. I just had to throw away my old Coleman stove that I bought from a junk store 10 years ago. It was probably 20 years old and totally dented and rusted out already when I picked it up, and it still lasted me that long. The main reason I really got rid of it was because of all the unsightly rust, but the hose and the valves and the burners all worked perfectly. I used it all year-round, a few days a week.

This thing, on the other hand, I'm not sure will last  a third as long as the old one. It's pretty flimsy, the latch is weak, and what really sucks is that the cheap burner valves offer no resolution. It's either full blast or all the way off. Even worse, the valves rebound when you turn them. This means you have to turn them past the position you want and let them come back some, especially on the way down. Achieving a low flame is like building a deck of cards; the flame goes out 3 times before you get a flame low enough to cook eggs or pancakes, and you gotta bend over the whole time futzing with the knob like you're picking the lock to the queen's undies.

The only good parts are the burners themselves, which I'm sure have benefited from the hard work and research of Coleman designers which have obviously long since retired. The latest batch of engineers aught to just quit. Give up and go home because you ruined a respected brand and a long-standing product.",2.0
Didn't really work never able to use,2.0
"This Coleman camp stove is nothing like the original American made stove. The knobs were ultra sensitive causing the flame to burn either really high or really low. Also, there was no easy ignite on this model. The only reason that I gave it two stars, is because it was easy to clean and it cooked the food when I was hungry.",2.0
"Adjustment valves are very chincy.  I noticed that at a set position the burner got hotter and hotter, but it was cheap (it shows) and its only for cooking bacon outside so I guess not that bad of a grill.",2.0
"The stove is much what I expected from the product description except for one important issue: it is impossible to set the burner controls to simmer. I adjust the control to get a low flame but when I release the knob, it always moves back to a higher setting; it is as if it is on an elastic band. It is disappointing and not of the quality one expects from the Coleman brand. The stove works fine apart from this problem - but, then, so it should because there is not much technology in such a simple product.",2.0
"I bought this item back in August 13, 2013, but did not started using it until late October. Through November, December, and January I used the stove about 2-3 times  day for 10 minutes with a pressure cooker. Starting sometime into January the adapter started to have problems with screwing on the small 1lb propane tanks. At first I thought the neck of the tanks were faulty so I would change the tank and get another and would latch on. This problem got worse until now in February after trying out 6 different tanks the adapter no longer latches at all. I now have to buy a new adapter. Like others have mentioned the turn knob for the regulation of the flame is not accurate. If you want it low it returns back up to some higher setting. I am quite disappointed with the adapter only lasting 3 months. I rather not have to spend extra money every 3 months for a new adapter. It does what it is supposed to do which is burn the gas to let you cook your meal, but the adapter breaking down so quickly is a big turn off.",2.0
Seemed like our unit arrived in good shape but one of the valves was either poor quality or damaged; extremely difficult to set the burner consistently and if you barely touched the knob or wiggled it back and forth it would either flare up or flame out.  Returned to Amazon.,2.0
"What I do not like about this camp stove is that it is nearly impossible to get a low level flame from the burner.  Once the burner is lit, it throws out a lot of heat and that gets to be a problem when one wants to let something simmer on the stovetop after it has been fully cooked.",2.0
"I have one of these stoves and it has mostly worked well. But it irritates the heck out of me how flimsy the ""windbreaks"" on the ends are and how easily the ""clips"" fall out.",2.0
The frame was bent. I had to attach a screw on the bottom to level it. It apparently was bent at the time of manufacture. Poor quality control.,2.0
"It worked on two camping trips, then on the third it produced dangerous flames about 3 feet high. I examined it and saw no visible clogging/dirt, etc... I'll likely disassemble and attempt to fix but it seemed clear that nothing was on fire. I believe whatever regulator this has built in is malfunctioning.",2.0
"Setting up a new camping outfit, we got a new tent, air mattress, lantern and camping stove, all Coleman. The tent and air mattress: great! The lantern: terrific! The stove: not too good.

We did not have the problem that many others seem to have had; namely, an aluminum tray that catches and is not secured to the base properly. And, as with older models, the design is a winner -- adjustable wind flaps, and folding and carrying that are well-thought out (as long as you are able to carry the portable propane tanks separately).

BUT, the raison d'etre of a stove is .... HEATING. You cannot control the flame on this thing. No matter how precisely you adjust the flame, no matter how carefully you remove your hand from the knob, the flame immediately goes to high. It would be more accurate to have an on/off switch instead of a knob. This was okay when we wanted to boil water, but trying to actually cook was not at all pleasant. This was true on both burners.

Coleman should be ashamed. Is this the start of the demise of the Coleman reputation? Surely the company knew about this before these went out to the public. I won't be so quick to assume a Coleman product is good quality anymore. Of all the things to get wrong! You wouldn't think a stove's heating capabilities would be considered optional by the manufacturer.

I thought about exchanging this item, but the number of reviewers making the same complaint indicates a return is more in order. Our next stove will not be Coleman.",2.0
This is really useless in Europe.  I bought it in the U.S. but have never used it in Europe.  It is extremely difficult to get Coleman propane gases in Europe.,2.0
"I've always trusted Coleman for quality. I guess that honeymoon is over. The stove does what a stove is supposed to do, it heats stuff. But I'm really not sure how long it will do that for. There is no quality here. The outer metal case is extremely thin. It had a small dent when I received it and when I saw how thin the metal was I figured I should just be happy it made it in one piece. The hinges for the side pieces are riveted in place....with small, thin aluminum rivets going through paper thin metal....they're all loose...except for the one that had already popped out....that was rolling around the box when I opened it. No blame to the seller here at all. I got what I ordered and the damage was all concealed damage that came about because of poor quality control and poor construction. This is a poorly made product with every corner cut to keep manufacturing costs down and margins high because it has the Coleman name. I kept it because I needed it right away when I got it but I'm back in the market for a new stove and Coleman brand will not be one of my sort options.",2.0
"As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit.  You see, the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings.  No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water, a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast.  My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one), and it worked great.  You're on the right track, but keep looking...stay with propane, but away from this model.  I've seen others comment with this same concern, so it is a quality control/product issue.  C'mon Coleman...build it US, build it right.",2.0
"I've been a fan of Coleman stoves up until this one. As a previous reviewer posted, the shoddy construction and ultra-low quality sheet metal combine to create a product that I'm ready to get rid of. The edges are sharp, the top doesn't latch, and due to some engineering/manufacturing issue, the bottom green metal piece does not fit properly into the silver metal lip. I'm currently looking for a replacement stove because of how horribly this one is made.

All that said, it does cook stuff pretty well without issue, but if it gets crushed on the car ride to the camp site, what's the point?",2.0
"My son is 3.  Even though he is within the specified weight range, I thinks this product wasn't a good fit.  We only had it for a week and it stopped working.

The trouble seemed to come in when he tried to push it like a regular scooter.",2.0
"I was looking forward to this mat because it was just the size I needed and the material was going to be easier to clean than the old fashion bamboo type. However, it took only until the third use for the binding to separate from one whole side. There was no weather condition or style of use that could have caused this (I used it on grass in a quiet, ordinary park), only workmanship defects. The binding is not compatible with the mat itself and now I expect fraying and further separation. I am disappointed, the look is good but the quality is poor.
Don't make the same mistake as me: I don't get to spend much time in the park and my infrequent usage made me miss the deadline to return it.",2.0
Cheaply made. After about 5 uses it tore at the seam.,2.0
"edges came apart after one day of use at the beach, cheaply made",2.0
The edging/trim has started to separate from the mat after 2 uses on the beach.,2.0
Not very well made but it was only $10 bucks so what do you expect.  Good enough for the beach.,2.0
Does what it should but poorly made. First time I used it I tried to flick the mat like you would a towel to get the sand off-  the straw pulled from the side stiches! It won't last more than a few uses.,2.0
"Price isn't much, but neither is the quality. I saw someone with the exact same mat and theirs had problems with the edge material coming off and the mat then fraying. The second time that I used the mat I found out how fragile the edges are. Now my mat has frayed edges too. Nice idea, bad implementation.",2.0
Ripped after/during first use. Returned.,2.0
"Sadly,  material ripped very easily",2.0
"I really wanted to like this product,  and I do... It's nice looking.  But I only used it once, and the top started to rip already.  I haven't had the opportunity to use it again.",2.0
"I would greatly like the matt, however one end started fraying the first time we used it.  The edging came off and it started to unweave.  I have used Duck tape to hold the end and stop the progression of distruction.  I was very dissapointed that a ground Matt would be so frail.  The general design and concept is a good one, just wish it were sturdier.",2.0
"I bought this everlast swivel a week ago along with an everlast 4210 speedbag from acadamy.  I am not a boxer, and do not plan to be one. I only bought the speedbag and swivel to do something physically active that isn't as boring as running.  The swivel only lasted a week till the first link (the eyelet) completely detached from the ball socket.  There is a small screw inside the socket's ball which attaches the first link. After using an allen wrench to put it back together. Again, after 20 minutes of practice on the speed bag, the swivel broke again. Judging by the construction of other speed bag swivels, this is the only swivel where this problem arises, and is likely to occur often.  I would recomend this swivel only if you are getting a speed bag for a youngster (under 14), or just need one for display.  If you plan on spending more than a couple hours a week messing around on a speed bag, go with the Everlast Top Professional Chain Link Swivel (Model # 4444).",2.0

"I bought this to jump on while doing Insanity. I could feel the floor when jumping on it. I sent it back and got a big 2"" thick foam mat from We Sell Mats. I think it's listed as a tumbling mat. It was MUCH better, exactly what I was looking for. This might be ok for someone lying down on it, but if you want something this squishy, maybe you should do your exercises on a bed.",2.0
It's not firm as some other reviews suggested. The material feels cheap. Definitely not worth the $$. You should look elsewhere.,2.0
Kind of flimsy for my intended purposes. And the design is more long rectangular. Better use is if you're doing yoga or crunches for it but nothing else.,2.0
"I own a boxing gym. The prior ab mats lasted me for approx 3+ years. I wish I could recall the name brand they were. These Everlast Mats, I ordered 4 of them, all 4 ripped the very first week. They were not abused, just simply sliding up against the wall to put them away, or if anyone scooted on them, they tore that way too. Very strange.

It's a shame, because I really like how thick they are. Just to darn paper thin!!!",2.0
"Purchased this product hoping it would be thick and soft enough to provide comfort as a sleeping mat. Neither thick nor soft. Probably good as a workout mat, but no good for sleeping.",2.0
"I bought this mat for my granddaughters who are taking dance classes and I was not impressed with the mat size....the picture it showed on the site had me thinking that the mat was a lot larger...so if you want a really good size mat for tumbling exercises, you may need to buy two or get a larger one.",2.0
"I bought these and another set (ALI), and have found that these are really slim inside. There is lots of padding and not really enough space for your hand to fit comfortably or really to bend your fingers. Would not recommend for anyone over 6yrs old.",2.0
"Not worth the price I paid.  I purchased 2 of these mats in search of the Everlast mats that are like the ones in my gym. These look the same but they aren't solid like the old ones. They are better than some of the cheaper versions but again, NOT worth the price. If you expect to get a good sturdy mat like Everlast used to make, this mat is NOT it! I guess they just don't make them like the older version. The original Everlast mats weren't made of sponge. Don't know what they were made of but they're much better than these and yes, my ORIGINAL mats are still going strong. I'm not sure these will last very long at all.

You can see in the picture how the vinyl looks wrinkled. That's because it is and it doesn't fit tight like the original.  $[..] would have been worth the price for the original but not for this one, definitely not the $[..] they are asking now!",2.0

This pogo stick is just too hard for my son ( 5 years old ) to use. I even have a hard time pushing him down. Hopefully the spring will break in.,2.0
This pogo stick is stiff and unwieldy. My large 6 year old son cannot operate it and neither can any of the other older boys in the neighborhood. It is just too stiff to work properly. I would love to return it and just go with a basic pogo stick like I had as a kid but we have had this for 6 months now. Still doesn't work. Not worth the money.,2.0
This pogo stick was the most appropriate I could find for a 5 year old who weighs around 35#s.  My grand-daughter likes it but must position it next to a chair so she can hold on to the chair while pogo-ing.  She does not have enough weight to get the bounce she needs to really pogo with this stick. I would recommend this stick for children who weigh more than 35#s.,2.0
"I just wanted to give everyone a warning that there was a voluntary recall of this product.  Any ""Grow-To-Pro"" pogo stick manufactured after August 2007.  Apparently a few children have gotten facial injuries.  According to the report I saw, one child actually needed stitches.
Supposedly, the stick gets stuck in the down position and releases without warning, therefore causing injury if you're not ready for the release.
I'm not writing this to deter anyone from purchasing this product, I just wanted to make parents/grandparents aware of the issue.  Like I mentioned previously, this was a VOLUNTARY recall.  Not mandatory!

"Kinda disappointed of the quality. Right from the get-go you'll notice that the materials used was fairly cheap. I've had great spalding basketballs prior to this one. This just doesn't compare I guess they don't make quality spalding basketballs anymore except for the highly priced ones. I'm sorry to say this but, ""made in china"" says it all. Pretty much wasted money on this one. You're better off buying wilson basketballs, though they're also ""made in china"", they use far more better materials. I play competitive basketball, indoors, once a week and I shoot around and play pick up about 3 times/week outdoors. If you really wanna go for this basketball I recommend just using it indoors and always make sure to keep it clean. Or you could just go and grab the wilson jet.",2.0

"I got these as a gift. Never used goggles before. It was difficult to get the straps loose enough for comfort. They did seal well the one time I used them. Then I dried them off and they were ruined. There is some kind of waxy coating on the inside of the lenses. Once you touch that surface, no matter how soft the cloth or gentle the touch, they acquire marks that look like scratches, but are really streaks in the coating. Further efforts to buff out the marks just make it worse.

If your gym bag never sits in the car or you live further north then you may be okay with these, but I cannot recommend them solely for this reason.",2.0

worked great for a few days then realized H2o was getting into my eyes no matter what adjustments I made. Figured out that sunscreen had melted the rubber gaskets rendering the goggles useless,2.0

Was fine for the first hour.  On subsequent use water still got in. Too difficult to adjust. I will try another model instead.,2.0
leaks after diving down more than 5 feet. Water pressure affects the goggles and they scratch pretty bad too. omg,2.0
"The quality of the ball just wasn't what I expected.  The leather was too loose on each of the balls, making them feel mushy.  These would probably be okay for little league, but I was looking for some good BP balls for high school aged kids, and these just aren't good enough.",2.0
"Not impressed. They say only cosmetic blemishes. This is totally false! I had some baseballs that were not even round. They had terrible stitching and raised leather. A lot of the baseballs can ONLY be used on a tee they were either warped or just felt really spongy. The leather was not sewn tight and plenty of baseballs had wrinkles in the leather. Bottom line is that these are not just cosmetic defects, the baseball as a whole is a defect. I would not recommend  these. You did get some that were actually good baseballs, but not nearly enough.",2.0
"I have purchased these balls many times. They usually come individually wrapped , and are of excellent quality. This batch came in a different bucket, and the balls are knock-offs. Not individually wrapped, different seems, cheaper synthetic feeling covers ,stamped made in China, different ink and font of printing, and smell like chemicals. I was very surprised when I opened the lid !!!",2.0

"This seemed like such a great idea--I really wanted to like it. It was a lot smaller inside than I thought it would be, but it did fit perfectly behind my car seat. The lids didn't seem to close very securely--which is frustrating because it lets the cold out. In addition the strap kept falling off one side--I could not get it to securely stay on. In the end, I had to return it--just not worth the money.",2.0
too narrow...holds about 8 cans with ice,2.0
I bought this cooler to fit between the back bucket seats of my Enclave. It does fit but could have been wider. A can of soda will not fit laying down from side to side.......if they had made the cooler wider by an inch or so the can would fit nicely. Bad design flaw in my opinion.,2.0
The latch is not very tight so ice doesn't last long. Dispointed in Quality. One of the reason I bought was because it was Rubbermaid.,2.0
today the left pedal fell off. Now I can not tighten the pedal as tight as I should have.i don't know how to fix it.,2.0
"Oh, sure, it didn't fall apart on me. But from the moment it's unpacked, this bike has problems:

First, assembly. The manual was apparently written for all of Huffy's bikes concurrently, and is useless at assembling this one, because only a few random bits apply to building this model (and it is not immediately clear which). It doesn't come with an Allen wrench of the appropriate size, and it was surprisingly difficult to find one. Having just assembled all of the furniture in my apartment from scratch, I can say that even taking the non-specificity of the manual into account, this is one of the least clear assembly guides I've ever seen. You can't make out most of the diagrams, much less figure out what they want you to do, and terms are used ambiguously throughout the manual.

Anyway, after a couple of hours of muddling, I managed to get the bike together. I then took it for a ride.

The bike advertises 15 speeds, but half of them don't seem to work. The chain slips in some of them, and others simply leave you pedaling with no impact on the bike's forward motion - this nearly caused an accident when I first tried it. The chain is not a component of the assembly, so I'm pretty confident it's an issue with the bike, and not something that I screwed up while putting it together.

Restricted to the subset of speeds which actually work, I find it very hard to get up hills. It is not very efficient for urban biking either (but then, it is a mountain bike). The hand brakes are too far from the handlebars and start to hurt your hands in short order (though some tinkering with a screwdriver may prove them adjustable).

Overall, I'd recommend spending $50 to $100 more and getting a better quality bike. I can't see myself riding this day-to-day.",2.0
This product doesn't seem to help that much.  My husband still comes in with lots of bites from mosquitos.  It may help keep the gnats away but it doesn't seem to be working that well although you certainly can smell the product while he wears it.,2.0

He put these on and went to try out his skateboard for a bit. He used them again on Saturday afternoon. By Saturday evening, one of the elbows pads was already coming apart. One whole side of the elbow protective piece was hanging off. That is absolutely ridiculous for less than 24 hours use. I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement.

"My son (in tears) and his dad are taking this great looking car apart to pack it back up to ship it back.  We currently have the smaller Kettcar so my son was SOOOO excited to find this ""larger"" one, listed as for 8-12yr. olds.  The box arrived today and listed right on the box, ages 4-9.  We called Amazon before putting it together to check on this age difference and were assured that the online listing was correct and Kettler must use the same box for all of their cars.  So, after an hr. of assembly, it is clearly the same size as the small one we were replacing.  I've called to complain again and been assured that the listing would be changed... if not, the Kettler Super Monaco XL is for ages 4-9, not 8-12 as stated currently.  I will say, if your child is young, it looks great and my son loves the one he already has.  Now, hopefully, the return will go smoothly and my son's long saved money will be quickly refunded.

He has just been riding it about 15 minuites and a pedal broke, I'm not too heartbroken, we will take it back and get him something he can ride on longer.  His sister got a green machine for her birthday, there is no comparison.  I feel bad for him and will not replace this, just return it and get something better.",2.0

On the plus side, they fit and my son didn't complain about wearing them but the knee pads are heavily scratched and one of them ripped right open the first time he used them.

"Sketchy craftsmanship, low-grade materials, junk.  They appear much more substantial than they are.  Upon arrival you will see that the outside layer of mesh is a form of see-through mesh.  The orange dots on the shell are just decor held in place by a paper backing on the inside of the shell.  The pads themselves are held on by two elastic/Velcro straps.  But, the materials are so loosely put together it makes for a lousy fit that just doesn't stay in place.

Regarding fit - they fit my 65 pound 7 year old son very well, with room to grow.  But I don't suspect they are going to last very long for him to grow.

I got these on a $10 special.  I'll let me sons trash them and toss them and maybe they will spare them from a skinned knee or elbow first.

"I am sorely disappointed in the quality of the pads we received. We used them twice (on a 5 year old) and they fell apart. We thought we would be getting a good quality item from Mongoose, but we were wrong. I would not buy this again.",2.0
"They are ok for the price and do the job. My only complaint is, as my son rides his skateboard, I need to constantly keep adjusting the straps to ensure that they are covering the knees and elbows as they continue shifting due to movement. It would of been really nice if these protectors would of been made of a sleeve type of fastening material were the arm had to be inserted into the sleeve as opposed to using straps to fasten. It can be a hassle constantly having to readjust the straps every 5 minutes. The actual construction of the pads is very sturdy and again, for the price it does what it is meant to do. I'd pay a few more dollars for the sleeve type of fastener.",2.0

"I bought these for paintball, and I had to return them upon opening the package. While they are certainly comfortable and well-padded, they are NOT for individuals with large legs. The straps can barely get around my bare legs, let alone with fabric under them. The velcro also feels cheap and prone to losing grip during activity.

Unless you're a teen or skinny, skip these and get knee pads with a hook-and-loop/buckle strap system.",2.0
I bought this from Amazon. The image on the web is good but the actual product is below expectation in term of building quality.,2.0
The product came quickly but the problem is that one knee pad is damaged and I'll return it. The saying that you get what you pay it's true this time.,2.0
"These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself. I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid's sized, but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing. The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight, and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically. The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads...except that they are even tighter than the knee pads; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off...I'll probably never use the elbow pads again. The knee pads at least do an ""okay"" job at protecting my knees (so long as they stay on) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents. I'll never be buying these again, nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children....(in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them.)",2.0
"I was excited when these came to my door; however, when I tried them on, I've realized that one side is very tight when the other side was alright. I took them off for a measurement, and realized that two straps on the knee pad are off by MORE THAN 2 INCHES!!!!! I am not sure if any other buyer has this problem, but I was shocked. Will definitely return them.",2.0

"the image does not reflect the smaLL size of the pads. I gave them to my kids, as it`s not even close to a large pad.",2.0
"Poor quality, but you get what you pay for, they were cheap. The orange pieces popped out when slightly pushed on (I ended up gluing them back in).

I'd spend a little more money and get a good pair. I used these for myself when roller blading with my daughter and went out and bought her a better pair of knee and elbow pads that came with wrist guards. Oh, and definitely a helmet for both of us!",2.0
"These are only Ok. Look elsewhere if you are looking for really good ones. I was sold on the ""gel"" part, but that neither seem to offer extra comfort nor additional protection compared to a well padded gear. The straps are too big for my child and too small for me. It appears that these are made for either a small adult, a big child or an average sized adolescent. The straps on this are poorly designed. Straps on protective pads are usually made to turn around on a ring before getting strapped with velcro. These do not do that and just go straight. Velcro is not long enough to support a decent range of sizes. So, I will use it because I bought them, but would not recommend or buy them again.",2.0
My biggest issue is the cover that goes around the frame. After 2 months of use it's completely falling apart and the string that is inside of it sticks out creating a huge safety hazard.,2.0

One of the rubber stoppers broke off,2.0
I purchased this product in February of this year & it only lasted until October.  I weigh 130 lbs & did not use it everyday (used as part of a weekly exercise routine).  I would not recommend this product.,2.0
This gave me a black eye trying to put it together.  The frame is in two pieces.  You have to push them apart and then lock them together while overcoming the force of the elastic springs.  If your hands slip there is a lot of force that can spring back into your face and cause it to bruse and swell.  Beware.  Once I go it together the two piece frame is unstable and causes the legs to bounce around as much as you do.  I have tried to adjust the legs but the thing just won't be level.  The good news is that aside from legs slapping the ground as you bounce it is quiet.,2.0
"Okay, So I ordered this trampoline and it appeared to be awesome! Was a great therapy tool for my son who has low muscle tone in his legs.

"I take it as my mistake. I did not read clearly that this does not come with springs like a normal mini tramp. I received the mini tramp a couple of weeks ago and my friend and I we're unable to put it together without the third person to help. Besides that, great tramp lol.",2.0
"This definitely isn't worth the money.  It didn't take much to put it together but, no matter what my husband tries, it bows.  Then either he or I will jump on it for a little while and it will eventually seems to straighten out.  But the next day it's bowed again.  Definitely go a different route if you are wanting a small trampoline.",2.0
This trampoline comes with no parts to bolt it together permanently. I think this is because they want it to be able to collapse and fold away. Which would be great except that every time you pick it up it collapses and the separated steel rods cut into the plastic rubber band surrounding the outer edges. We threw the plastic covering away after a few days because it was ripped. If you don't want it to collapse every time you move it you have to drag it around. It is impossible for one regular sized person to reassemble after it has collapsed. My husband the power lifter has to do it for me every time. So in conclusion it works just fine as a trampoline but you have to keep it out and forget about the plastic covering for the edges.,2.0
"Arrived without the bolts, nuts and wrench. Had to go to Home Depot to pick them up and guess at the right size. Then the bar was a bit bent, so I had to hammer it back into shape. Maybe I got one that was returned? The rubber tabs on the legs also don't do a great job of keeping it from slipping. Seems like a ok product once I got it together, but man, it was a pain to put together.",2.0

"I purchased this for some low impact exercise during the winter months, and it was far from low impact.

I chose this model because people suggested that it lasted longer because it didn't have springs, but you sacrifice the low impact benifits with that. After I FINALLY got it assembled, I jumped on it lightly for about a minute before the shooting pain started through my knees and hips (I'm 23 years old, that shouldn't be a problem) there is no give to this trampoline. I could have jumped up and down on the floor and been better off.

Assembly doesn't require the 3 people the instructions suggest, but the instructions are vague and there is way more parts than it tells you to use.

Once assembled it was nowhere close to level. So I wouldn't recommend using it on a hard floor. I moved it onto carpet. It did level out a bit after my 2 minutes of jumping.

I'll probably keep it since I don't think I could get it disassembled and back into the box, but I recommend not purchasing this item.",2.0

I'm not as excited to give this for Christmas as I was before I opened it.",2.0
"I was excited about getting my new trampoline in the mail and then it was some what of a Debbie-downer once we put it together; it took two of us to try spreading it apart and clicking it together; there's a strong chemical smell; and I was disappointed that it didn't bounce as I'd hoped. Like my husband always says, ""you get what you pay for"".",2.0
"It has straps, not springs, so it isn't very bouncy. That might be fine for people for some.  It also is not great to put together and spends most of its time in a very slightly folding position.  As in, it doesn't stay flat.  It is okay for my four-year-old to jump on indoors (that is what it was bought for), but if you weigh more than the 30 pounds she weighs, you might want to try one with real springs and one that doesn't fold up.",2.0

"This comes in pieces.  Assembly is really challenging, but I thought it would be a good thing to have for winter exercise and variety, plus a way to get my little dude some physical activity to burn off energy.

First, the thing is not at all bouncy.  There is no spring or bounce to this.  It's not much different than jumping up and down on the floor--just cushions a bit more.

My main problem is that fully assembled with all bolts in place, the circle is not flat.  It bends at the joints and is partially folded.  I can stand with a foot on each side and make it flat, but once I move, it goes back to being out of shape due to the high tension on the parts.

I am not sure how safe this is in that condition.  The bolts should keep it from coming apart or anything, but still.  After some intial interest by my little guy, this sitsin a corner taking up space.  Because it lacks bounce, it's just not that fun to use.",2.0
"This is a 2nd Trampoline that I have so I have something to compare to my previous one.

"Although this product seems to be ok once assembled, it is getting there that is very difficult.  The first thing the directions tell you is that you need 3 adults to assemble it. There are some nasty pinch points. This is a bad omen right away. It took myself my daughter and her husband to put this together. I almost gave up and sent it back when on the last try we were able to line everything up and go on from there. Don't even think of buying this if you have no one to help you. I would not recommend this product at all.",2.0
"I was really excited about this trampoline, great price, simple, assembly much less scary than I feared from some other reviews... and my girls were thrilled with it as their main Christmas gift.  And then, after two days of normal/intermittent use, the metal has warped such that two of the six legs don't even touch the ground.  My girls weigh about 25 and 40 pounds, and did nothing but jump normally, so I can't imagine how this happened, but I'm nervous it isn't safe now.  If it weren't going to be such a massive undertaking (if even possible) to return it, I would.  I'm really sad about it.  I'll be contacting the company, and will try to remember to update this review after that.",2.0
"Two things limited the rating on this product, neither of which speak to long term use or bounce for the buck.
1. It is much easier to assemble than some posts would have you believe. It is however a bit tricky to unfold. I put this together by myself in about 15 minutes. Be aware, until the bolts are in place, the frame can shift and is under a great amount of tension. I didn't have it snap back but did manage to pinch a chunk from my finger when it shifted. My fault for holding the seam when I was ""flattening"" the frame.
2. The actual reason for the lower rating, there is a very strong chemical smell from the product. I have it airing out on my front porch. Just be aware it may not be the thing to wait until Xmas morning to open and assemble.
Give it a couple days to air out and for any injuries to heal and it will probably be a great product.
Update:
After several weeks the strong smell never went away.  This was coming from the cover.  Also two legs bent from the very limited use.  Limited use because it could only be used in the garage because we couldn't bring it in the house.  It was inexpensive so no hard feelings but wish I had purchased something else as this ended up in the trash.",2.0
"very hard to assemble. legs screw into frame but not easily. one leg won't screw in at all, just sits there loosely.",2.0
Seriously its kinda like jumping on a chair cushion or something.  Doesn't feel good on your knees if they are bad.,2.0
Rusted !  Almost immediately nephew loved it but didn't get to use it after the first month! It ripped :(,2.0
The trampoline does not hold up even with minimal jumping. The trampoline has disformed on us a number of times.,2.0
Poorly made. Frame will twisted so that the feet on not properly aligned on floor. Can only be used with close attention to alignment of the feet.,2.0
The worst thing about this is the smell of the plastic.  It is very offensive.  I am disappointed in this item.,2.0
"The blue outer ring covering ripped pretty quickly, though it wasn't abused. the frame is either bent or loose somewhere. It's only had a 3 year old jumping on it, supervised so I know it wasn't abused.",2.0
"Bought this for my aspbergers son for sensory therapy. He uses it every day. It has been in his room for 2 weeks now and still smells of chemicals, had to move it out into main room till it airs out...Very hard to put together, cheap materials, flimsy legs and they won't straighten out even if you try to bend them into position...Wouldn't reccomend buying this again...",2.0
"It was ok to put together with 3 people, but it doesn't have an impressive springiness to it. I was really excited to get it for the kids, but they don't think it's that fun. I don't know if I'll go to the trouble of disassembling it now and returning it...kind of a bust.",2.0
"i bought mine from walmart for $25. It took 3 of us to put it together and about 45 mins. i was using it as a sensory input for my 95 pound  autistic spectrum child. he was the only 1 that used it. after a week of having it, the leg broke off from the frame. good thing that my son was on carpet because it flipped him off of it while he was bouncing on it (when the leg broke). Be careful when you use this item.",2.0
After screwing on the legs some of them were not even and some of them leaned inward. The rubber tips on the bottom of the legs had some pieces of the black rubber chipping off. It is not as bouncy as other ones I have used. Since it only cost $30.00 I am keeping it only because I do not want to pay return shipping.  I would not recommend wasting your money on this.,2.0
I just got this and I did not realize that you needed three people in order to assemble it. The instruction manual is in black in white and kind of blurry which makes it difficult to see the instructions. I wish I had bought another that was easier to assemble.,2.0
I bought this as a Christmas present for my boys (2012) and it is still in pieces because the directions say you need 2 people to put it together and there is only 1 of me. My kids are too little to help. And the directions are terrible. :( Very disappointed.,2.0
"Purchased this trampoline for my K-3rd grade classroom about 3 weeks ago. Used it for an occasional ""exercise/movement break"" for a classroom of 12 students. After about a week of minimal use (by CHILDREN) this ""200 lb capacity"" trampoline severely twisted/bent. I returned the trampoline and was sent a replacement. On April 10th, the replacement trampoline was assembled. This trampoline is also quick to bend and twist. My students haven't even used it, it was tipped on its side for storage, and when applying very little pressure against it (to move it and put it on its feet), it already twists and buckles. Slightly applying more pressure ""twists"" it back into shape again. We took the legs off the trampoline to double check that it was tightened correctly, tightened it and put the legs back on, but it still twists at the point where the halves are put together. An exercise trampoline should not twist and buckle like this.

I will allow the kids to try it out, but will return it for a refund if the frame twists like the other one did.",2.0
"As I was putting it together i noticed that the fifths leg's screw was missing which means you can't put one leg on it.  I thought it would be alright since it looked balanced, but now it is cricket and uneven.  I might as well had bought it at the store at its original price. DON'T BUY IT.",2.0
"THE GOOD: Contrary to what many reviewers are saying about how hard it is to assemble this trampoline, I found that part to be effortless. My guess is the manufacturer made some changes, because I assembled it all by myself without ANY difficulty. It required no strength.

THE BAD: It's not a real trampoline. The first thing my 6 year old son said after trying it was ""how come it's not bouncy?"". He wasn't kidding. When you jump on it, it gives a little bit, then you hit the bottom VERY noticeably (the bounce stops and it feels like you're hitting the floor), which after about 20 jumps gave me a headache. It lacks that fun, bouncy, weightless feeling every true trampoline has. I suppose I should have known better, seeing that this trampoline does not have springs. I'll be returning this for a mini trampoline with springs.",2.0
Have had it less than a month & the legs are bent & one fell off. It is used by my underweight 6 year old.,2.0
"Bought this for me, for working out and what not.  It doesn't have springs, just stretchy bands.  My kids love it, and for the $, I'm happy to let them use it, but I was pretty bummed. I can barely jump on it.  It just doesn't have enough spring for an adult.  I assembled it myself, though.",2.0
"For a product that cost over $100, i would have expected this tramp to last longer than 2 years.  The tabs holding the black trampoline floor have started to pull out and i can no longer use it at all.",2.0
"After one day of being out together, and only being jumped on by our 40 lbs 5 year old, the legs on this are already bending.  Poor quality.",2.0
"Very inconvenient to assemble.  No way one person can do it.  This item comes as a kit, not together like other mini trampolines on market.  I would not recommend this for use.",2.0
its a good thing to do exercise but is kind of broke already thats y i don't like it n i would love to get a new,2.0
You need three men to put this item together. There is no way u can do it with less than that. After a couple of uses it looks like its falling apart!,2.0
Didn't get around to using this much because the frame started to twist right away.  Tried to tighten the bolts but it wouldn't stay flat.  Finally the joint that connects the two half circles that make up the frame has started to bend....very dangerous.  The frame is under a lot of pressure from the trampoline pulling on it....don't want to be anywhere near it if it snaps.  Poorly made frame.,2.0
I bought this product for my 2 year old son thinking that he would enjoy jumping on it but quite to my dismay after we assemble it we noticed that its not properly balanced. Two of its base legs are not resting on ground which make it unsafe for little ones. I wish I have bought some better trampoline for my kid:(,2.0
"Finding this product was wonderful, but when I received it I found 2 huge problems. 1) One person CANNOT put this mini trampoline together alone. It takes 2-3 strong adults! This is not an acceptable situation for me. I'd have to hire people to get this product put together. 2) The trampoline cover is made of extremely poor quality material which feels like it could tear very easily. That would not be a deal breaker for me. I would be willing to buy a better trampoline cover for the price and quality of the trampoline.

Amazon needs to point out, right up front that 2-3 adults are required for assembly.

They did accept my complaint about ""Not as advertised"" for return and they make it very easy to return products. I'm sure with a re-write of the description, people who don't have to hire assistance will be very happy with this product.",2.0
When I got the trampoline I was surprised that it said that you need three people to put it together. Myself and my little sister put it together. I will say that it is very easy to put together. I came into problems when you went to move the tramoline because the trampoline base will move and fold so when you go to sit it back down it is not level or even with the floor. So each and everythime the trampoline gets moved you have to manipulate it tyo get it to sit straight. It is a hassel since it is moved alot because I bought it for my 2 and half yr old.,2.0
"Hard to put together and keep it from bowing. My 4 and almost 2 year old love it, however the plastic blue cover for the springs is awful. It started ripping immediately and never fit right. We bought this for them so I am a little concerned about just taking it off and throwing it away. This is the second one I have gotten. Although I plan on keeping it because it is a hassle to send back, I am not happy with the purchase.",2.0
"Was very hopeful my children could enjoy this trampoline inside during the hot, hot summer afternoons. Unfortunately the trampoline was very difficult to put together. Several of the legs did not want to attach and it seemed warped from the beginning. After just one week of use one of the legs completely folded and bent in on itself. The entire trampoline was completely unsafe for use. However Amazon was excellent and their return system worked perfectly, very fast and efficient.
I would not recommend this item to anyone.",2.0
"We got the package opened it up and read the directions it was VERY hard to set up. On top of that about the 4th time i whent to use it i noticed it was all crooked. I showed my dad and he tightened it to try to see if that worked and it did for about 2 more uses then it started folding up like taco kind of. It's whole frame pops in and out, we tried to take it apart and rebuild it that did not work either i belive that i got a BUM frame or it is just not well built if i even try to jump on it now it bends the upper frame... Not happy about this we are purchasing a new mini tramp!",2.0
"This was a Christmas purchase for my active toddler, so the weight on it is about forty pounds.  The construction is such that the legs are inclined to move inward, from the pressure of completed assembly maybe?  To ignore the legs moving inward would ultimately result in one of them getting tucked inward, eventually breaking, and well, you try hopping on something that has one less support leg.  If there were more weight on it the situation would be ore severe.  Would not purchase again, would recommend you not to purchase at all",2.0
There was no information that indicated I needed two to three people to put it together.  I had to send it back and I did purchase one already assembled from another company.,2.0
"The trampoline doesn't lay flat, I have to pull all the legs out each time I want to use it and make sure it's flat so the legs don't bend. Even then the legs don't all touch the ground at the same time. The screws need continual tightening.  I would not get this item again.",2.0
while it was easy to put together  the part you don't bolt down does not sit flush no matter how you play with it leaving a crooked trampoline that does not look very safe.,2.0
"We did not have any problems putting this together...my kids LOVED it!  Only problem, my 5 yr old (46lbs) and my 2 yr old (26lbs) were the only 2 jumping on it and they ONLY jumped 1 at a time.  The legs are bending and we've only had it a week or 2.  Even if they jumped 2 at a time, which they didn't, they are still under the weight requirement....very disappointed",2.0
The frame bent and cover ripped within one week of opening.  My kids are 5 and 7 and rarely break anything.  I'd go with a better product and I may try to return this one...,2.0
"I owned a mini trampoline was in the late '70s. I assume it was made in the USA because it was a one-piece framework and barely fit in my car. Fast forward to 2011: the assembly was a son-of-a-gun. The reviews I read on Amazon were stunning. I should have read them BEFORE I made the order. My new purchase sat on the floor for 3 weeks before I got up the courage to put the thing together - do or die. I gave up so many times. Then I decided I was going to succeed or throw the thing out the window. Fortunately I have some of my father's mechanical engineering talents. I read the poorly-illustrated but well-written instructions (they must have had a lawyer write them) and studied the thing for hours. Well, I succeeded single-handed and I didn't put an eye out or lose any fingers - because I was exceptionally careful. I weigh 230 lbs and I'm going to wear this thing out in no time. Springs rather than bands would make more sense. For the price I suppose it is a good value.",2.0
"I just received this and was not aware that it would require THREE people to assemble it. I have no problem assembling furniture, I actually enjoy it. But I live alone and it is impossible and unsafe to attempt to assemble it by myself. I have no idea how I'm going to ever get it put together unless I hire someone. I wish I had known the assembly required before I bought it. I would not have gotten it!  For now, it sits unassembled on my living room floor.",2.0
"My grandson was so excited about getting a trampoline.  I had one day shipping.  Arrived promptly.  Disappointed.  There were no instuctions and the bolts were missing.  My husband and son tried to find bolts to fit from his tool box. Looked again and again through shipping box but couldn't find any instructions.  Contacted helpline.  Unable to get through, left message. Decided to return item!",2.0
"Three of us, two competent adult women and a 17 year old teenager - looking like a sweaty game of Twister - couldn't put this together.  A month later it's still in the back seat of my car, awaiting the simultaneous availability of at least two tall friends with substantial girth, and very long arms...  I suspect it will be very sturdy once it's finally completed, but there's got to be a better, injury free way, to ship this to customers.",2.0
"I expected that the legs would not be on; but I never expected the difficulty I encountered assembling the rails and mat.
The instructions have a warning:
""3 adults in good physical condition are required for the following assembly.  Wear proper shoes and maintain balance to prevent a fall."" Good advice, but there is no way of knowing  the problems you can encounter until you get it out of the box and see the assembly instructions.
I got the rails and mat together; and it did take 3 adults.
I never could get the safety pad to fit.

I wouldn't buy this again.",2.0
"The lock was a good price and solid - my bike didn't get stolen - but after a year it became difficult to open, and now (year 2) I can't open it at all.  My bike is safe, but I need to get bolt cutters to release it and get a replacement lock.  So, its not long lasting but you get what you pay for.",2.0
"It is a cheap chain and works fine unless it rains, after that problems occur with rust",2.0
"After the first rain the lock became impossible to close.  I have to put the key in, turn it, then wiggle the top loop and press really hard to get it to lock in. Sometimes it just pops back out.  Pretty frustrating and inconvenient.  You get what you pay for.  Going to buy a padlock from Lowes to replace it.  The chain is fine, wish it was a foot longer.",2.0
Lock became almost impossible to close/open without counter force (pulling against tree or pressing down on table) and emended streangth,2.0
The chain seems sturdy and will serve its purpose.  The lock was sturdy but the key provided was flimsy and after the second attempt would not open the lock.  Don't buy unless you have your own lock already.,2.0
This is a very short chain that cannot reach the metal part of the bike from a bike rack.  Also it rained the day after I got it and the lock was broken rusted the next day.  From this purchase I learned that I live in a very nice area that doesn't steal bikes.,2.0
"my three year old daughter prefers to fall and get scars than to use these pads.  she says these pads are very uncomfortable and they hurt her.  when she does wear them, she takes them out after two minutes.",2.0
There is no wires or switch in side just sping steel. After a few weeks of daily use it would get stuck on or off. Get the Bell haeadlights. Tip: get rechargable batteries front headlight drain batties very quickly.,2.0
I have now gone through about 4 of these Schwinn units. They all suffer from the same design flaw. The signal wire is extremely fragile. They work great when they work but inevitably the signal wire breaks and renders the entire system useless. My wife and I used these on our road bikes and they would be ok for about a year or so and then one day they would just stop working. If you are not looking for durability this is a nice little basic unit that will serve the recreational casual biker well for awhile. Just be aware it is cheaply made. I paid about $13 for these at our local big box store so I am amazed they are now $34. For that kind of money you can buy a much better Cateye or Sigma brand basic cyclocomputer of much better quality.,2.0
I can't seem to get mine out of metric mode.  Does anyone know how to fix it?,2.0
"it froze while on a ride i needed the distance and speed on. 1 mm gap between magnet and sensor, come on, thanks anyway, have to live with it, cuz i had to tear the packaging to get it. will not recommend it to any one i call a friend",2.0
This computer worked great at first but then it stopped working after a week of use. Cannot recommend it to others.,2.0
I bought this for my wife's bike because I am very happy with a similar unit from Schwinn I bought for mine last year.  Unfortunately on this one the latch that holds the head unit to the handlebar mount is very weak and the unit will come off all too easily.  Sometimes it works loose while riding.  Fortunately when that happens you will see the speedo stop working and you have time to get it secured before it drops off completely.,2.0
"I bought mine at Wallyworld a few years ago for a lower price than here.  The instructions are full of errors.  For example, it says to press either button to start the setup.  That never worked.  I played with it for a few minutes and discovered that you have to hold both buttons down for 5 seconds to get into setup mode.  It says that the wheels on the little bicycle on the display are supposed to change direction to indicate acceleration or deceleration.  That feature has never worked.  Once it is set up, it is not very reliable.  It's like it uses a Microsoft program.  It frequently ignores commands (me pushing a button) and sometimes goes into freakout mode, with all display fields flashing, when I simply press the right button to switch modes.  It has gotten more glitchy as time has gone by.  The battery is also hard to find in discount or drug stores (available on Amazon, tho).",2.0
"bot one from wall-mart, work good, just battery last little over a year, to change battery you will need to reprogram computer. Couple  years later bot from amazon for my sons bike,  holder does not hold computer just few month later",2.0
"to be quick and to the point. functionally the unit is great, does exactly what is says and is expected to do.  down side! the unit attachment idea stinks and mine would not remain clipped during my ride.  fell off twice and broke. o and i have only had it for 1 week.",2.0
"It's ok, it does the job, but the problem is that It doesn't stay in it's little clip very well.  Many times I've knocked it out and it fell off or I was riding along and it wasn't logging the last ??? miles?  Other than that it's ok.",2.0
"It fell apart while I was trying to mount it onto the bike. The good news is that I called the manufacturer and told them what happened. Within the next couple of days, a newer and way better model arrived. I am VERY happy with it and admire and appreciate the way the manufacturer supported their product. GREAT customer service.",2.0
"Fine for the indoor trainer but I wouldn't rely on it. Good for the price, but juts doesn't feel high quality.",2.0
"I purchased this odometer/computer for my mountain bike. Assembly was not difficult at all. I did have one question. I called the 800 number that was provided and the agent was very helpful.

Bad News- On my second ride, the unit popped off and I lost it on the trail. Poor design...

Good News- I called the 800 number again, and they will be sending me a new unit as a ""courtesy"".

Bottom Line- ""just ok"" product,  (then again it was only $10.95), but  ""Good"" costumer service.",2.0
"As with all the bike accessories that are in the big-box discount stores like Wal-Mart, Target, Meijers, etc. (and the bikes, themselves, for that matter), this speedometer is designed primarily for casual or child use. Keeping that in mind, here are the negatives:

1. The attaching mechanism on the mount is a flimsy, rubber strap with eyelets that hook around a nub. Other reviews have stated that bumps will cause it to pop off. While it hasn't happened to me (yet), it certainly seems plausible.

2. Because of the cheap design of the mount, it can only be oriented (mounted) one way. At most, you can angle the speedometer a little one way or the other, but can't rotate it a complete 90. IOW, if you want to attach it to the handlebar stem to save space on your handlebars for something else, you're SOL. This is not the case with other, better bike speedometers.

3. The speedometer doesn't inspire confidence when inserting it into the mount (it doesn't feel very secure). Other reviews have stated the speedometer comes loose and does not make proper contact with the mount and, again, it sure seems like it could happen.

4. The wheel spoke magnet has four little plastic 'tangs' that hold the magent into that mount. The problem is the tangs can actually make contact with the sensor. I was hearing a faint 'clicking' noise and discovered it was one of the tangs cutting a nice groove into the sensor. Fortunately, I was able to move the magnet away from the sensor and it still works, but who knows for how long?

5. The speedometer's buttons feel downright cheap, like a plastic toy.

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it has the biggest numeral display for speed of any of the cheap speedometers. But that aside, save your money and invest in a slightly more expensive, better speedometer like Cateye or Sigma that are carried by an LBS, big-box sports store (like Dicks), or online.",2.0
"This spedometer/odometer was easy enough to install, and was quite functional for nearly two months.  It attaches to your bike's handlebars with a little clip it can be slid out of, like many bike lights.  Unfortunately, the clip doesn't hold the spedometer securely, and it fell off several times (when riding, and not) and was eventually lost.  If they were still $10 I'd buy another, paint it red, and glue it on, but for $20 you can get a device with more functionality (or at least styling that makes it easier to find on the ground).",2.0
"My unit lasted for little over three months. I was generally happy with it, but would not by another one. Let me tell you why.

The unit has few flaws but the fatal is the bike ""docking"" piece. The plastic wears off quickly if you dock and undock it everyday. Eventually unit will fall off almost on its own and once that happens in traffic - it's gone. The readability of the display good be better and although the unit is surprisingly well sealed for moisture, it tends to suck it in.

On the brights, the unit works and provides the desired functions. If it hadn't died because the other shortcomings, I would still be using it",2.0
"I have used this electronic odometer only once, and after I put all the info into the device (26 inches each wheel) it said that I had ridden my bike (a 26 inch hybrid) for almost 11-1/2 miles. So my unit is VERY inaccurate, since I googled the distance and it added to only a little more than 8 miles - 33 percent less. Other thoughts: As I started to put the computer on my bike I saw that the mounting ""hardware"" consists of only several plastic zip ties, as though the manufacturer even concedes that it won't last way too long (or perhaps that the user will upgrade to something better?). Everything else that I have placed on my bike has mounting hardware that's much more permanent instead of these small white zip ties.

The cable also just doesn't look very good on a nice ride. It appears cheap. I was also worried about how the small magnet installs on the spokes, by using a screw and its plastic casing which wraps around the spoke. Immediately I could imagine vibrations moving the magnet or making it wiggle free; once this ever gets lost, you can't measure anything.

That same afternoon of my first test, I stopped at a Subway for a 6-inch sub. The LCD screen had pretty much turned black from sun exposure, and the heat was focused into the center portion of its screen. After about 10 minutes I started being able to read the numbers again.

The concept is nice and the computer scan is a neat feature, but when someone wants to gauge their trip totals accurately, what's the point in having this if you still have to Google your trip to get an accurate distance? Maybe I should just pocket my GPS and let it track my trip instead, or just hop back on the web to add up my trip totals. I wish I could write something more positive.",2.0
"the computer started to malfuction after 4 months. it just keeps resetting, even after i changed the battery.",2.0
"I found the instructions very difficult to understand, and I am not computer novice - indeed I was a technical writer and wrote things like this.

Instead of cramming all the information in one small sheet, it should have been expanded to full page size with easy-to-follow steps. This is a common practice and would have cost nothing.

Also the leftmost characters in the display are not visible, making it harder to understand. The cyclist symbol at the upper left is so small it is useless. It is supposed to indicate acceleration or deceleration, something the rider already knows.

It would be nice if they included some additional Zip Ties to secure the extra cord.

The battery is a tiny thing, I wonder how long it will last.",2.0
"If all you do is ride mid-day this thing will work fine.

"I purchased 22 of these pedometers for a walking club at my work recently.  They have been used for 2 weeks now and already 5 of them have stopped working correctly or have broken.  I used one of them with my better pedometer to see how close they were and they track fairly well.  I would say they track about 10% more steps then my more accurate pedometer does.

They just do not last well at all.  They should last longer then 2 weeks.",2.0
"I managed to get about 50 days out of one of these before it died. By then the hinge was broken. I have also returned two to the store-one never worked, the other fell apart in a day.",2.0
"Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design.  The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as ""SW1"" SW2"" etc, but they are not labeled as such on the device.  You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are (""TR"" ""CH"" what??) Just an unfreindly interface all around. Look for a better unit.",2.0
"Had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass. Small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack, but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed. I also have a Brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer. We'll see how long the 2nd one lasts.",2.0
"About myself:
I'm a Power Yoga Teacher with my own studio. I'm into Yoga since about seven Years and I train every day.
Personally I prefer fluid Vinyasa programms challenging strength a lot but still contributing to every aspect of Yoga.
Since I'm german my english spelling is pretty bad, excuse me for that.
About the DVD:
I highly recommend Bryans earlier Complete Power Yoga Collection. I also own two of his CDs (Long, slow, deep and Advanced2) and think they're really great.
Unfortunatly I'm not content with this DVD.
The problem is not so much Bryans voice, like some other Reviewer stated (although he was right, the voice changed a little, but that doesn't bother me at all).
The problem is that Bryan talks all the time. Other Yoga Teachers do that too, but in a different manner. A Yoga Teacher should give a lot of information and he should encourage his students. The problem with Bryan is that he seems to try to win a Speedtalking Competition. He obviously reached such a high level in Pranayama that he doesn't need to breath at all between sentences. The most important thing in Yoga is a calm mind. This is hard to do with Bryans way off talking in the Background. It is absolutly distracting, even if you, beeing a Yogi, try to stay calm, concentrate on the Asanas and ignore him.
My girlfriend who teaches Yoga too, found it distracting aswell.
Bryan gives a lot of verbal information on all of his programms. On the other programms I own that is absolutly ok. He talks much but not to fast or to distracting. I don't understand what went wrong with this programm, but I think anybody can screw up a little somtime.
I truelly think Bryan is a great teacher. I totally respect him and I like his style a lot.
This beeing said, back to this DVD.
The other thing that I disliked is the Creation of the Flow. In my opinion it ist not round and not fluid enough. It is a very hard workout for the lower Body (legs and Butt) but seems to overlook most of the rest.
A complete Power Yoga workout should for example start with Sunsalutations, move over to Standingposevariations, Stomach- and Backposes, Twist and Inversions and in the end Shavasana, so the whole body is adressed. It's ok if some Programms specialice more on some Parts off the Body but I feel Bryan was not successfull with this one.
It misses the Vinyasa and seems to be unbalanced.
One thing I strongly criticise is that Bryan doesn't feel the need to comment on Shavasana (Resting Pose). He simply guides you there and the programm and music stopps. He talkes all the time but nothing on Shavasana, the so called most important Pose in a Yoga workout. To me this is a No Go in Yoga. He should at least tell his students to stay in the Pose for a few minutes, totally relaxed and feel what there Body  is telling them.
If Bryan was tryin to create a Yoga Based Fitness Workout for leggs and Butt, he was successfull. But that is more gymnastics, not Yoga.
If you are looking for a real Power Yoga Programm, try his earlier DVD, his CD's or try Baron Baptiste, Shiva Rea, some of Rodney Yees Programms, Eoin Finns Happy Yoga DVD or Rainbow Mars (See my listmania list on Power Yoga for all DVDs I recommend).
I hope this was helpfull to you! Let me know.
Namast",2.0
"I'm not even sure what's going on in this DVD. The program starts with an annoying infomercial, and the main screen gives you a choice of an Introduction with Bryan Kest or the main workout. But this menu is apparently some sort of mean trick on the viewer, because you're treated to a 10 minute Bryan Kest introduction before the main workout starts anyway (featuring such helpful advice as: ""Now everyone let's talk about the most important thing you can do - I like to call it breathing""). The workout itself does not strike me as in any way more challenging than his earlier DVDs (except for the excessive targetting of the legs). The commentary throughout is way beyond excessive; exactly why does Kest feel the need to try to convince someone doing yoga of its health benefits?

Bummer.  Not very good, I'm sorry to say.  The pace is tooooo slow, the moves are fairly basic (although options are given), and it just feels uninspired.
If you are just starting, these would probably suffice, but I would recommend that you quickly purchase the entire series from 1995.  The only downside is the format--no DVD option on those.",2.0

"Well it took 2 tries to get one of these that at least will heat and light without flames flaring all around burner assy.  The over all construction quality is mediocre, it is not near the quality of the previous 2 stoves from Coleman that I have owned thru the years.  My last stove lasted 22 years, I feel I will be lucky to get 5 out of this one.
But you know the thing that I feel is the saddest?  Coleman's customer service phone help is abysmal.  The 2 different 'experts' I talked to with the first unit appeared not to have ever seen this stove.  They read me the troubleshooting suggestions in the operator's manual and had no other ideas. Worse yet I felt like I was an interruption to their day.

"I bought this stove as a backup for our propane stove, for use in car camping.  I have had no problems with filling, pressurizing, lighting, or cooking.  I don't find the metal of the stove particularly unsuitable.  Yes, it's thin enough to flex; but it seems to get the job done just fine.

My major complaint is that Coleman rightly recommends that you store the fuel tank dry to avoid buildup of varnish as the fuel evaporates; however it is impossible to get the fuel out of the tank.  The fuel cap is on a section of the tank that is depressed, so when you try to turn it upside down to pour the fuel back out, nothing comes out.  It's a great spill-proofing feature, but it means you would have to find a siphon hose or something similar to empty it.  That's a big hassle.  Two thumbs down.  I guess I'll stick with propane.",2.0
"I'm wondering if there's a place in China called Wichita Kansas because if this thing is truly made in the United States of America I'd be a tad embarrassed if I worked for Coleman. The quality and fitment of this stove is pathetic. I think they should really consider having this built elsewhere, like China, Tiawan, Malasia or anywhere else overseas because the things I've seen coming out of these foreign countries could run circles around this product. I have 2 Coleman stoves besides this one. A compact two-burner, circa 1965, and a similar model built in 1986. I bought this one just because it's bigger and can handle larger pots and pans. First of all, the metal is just paper thin. I could easily fold the lid in half if I wanted too. It wobbles and flexes to the extreme just opening it up and putting the wings in place, which are even worse, BTW. The back lip, where the grill attaches was bent out of shape, I guess from the assembly process, I don't know. I bent it back in place but the grill fits so poorly you can slide it out of the slot on one side while it's in the down position. The fuel tank tabs fit so poorly in the slots on the front that it wouldn't stay in on it's own. I had to bend the tabs on the fuel tank to get it to stay in place. I have a camping trip planned soon so I'll have a chance to try out the burners, which appear to look OK. The tank will pump up and hold air and it makes a hissing noise when I turn the valve. We'll see how it performs in the field but I can't see getting many years of service out of this one. Very disappointed. The only reason I didn't give it just a single star is I'm giving the burners the benefit of the doubt. I'll be hanging on to my old stoves and will probably make an effort to take better care of them just because I know they'll even outlast this new one. I would have gladly paid a higher price for better quality.",2.0
"Ok, so I'm a lifelong Coleman fan.  My father always had all the classic camping gear, and I have their coolers, their lanterns, and now this stove.  I purchased it about 1 year ago from Amazon and noticed from the very first time I used it that the flame never did quite turn that lovely blue that it was supposed to.  It was always tall, yellow and left the bottom of my cookware and the burner covered in soot.  No matter how long I let the stove heat up, how much or little I pumped it up did nothing to resolve the issue.  I called Coleman and, without too much hassle, received a replacement generator that they assured me would fix the problem.

I honestly cant remember if the issue was temporarily resolved or not, but either way the last several uses the high yellow flame has returned.  The only way I can get it to turn blue is if I open the fuel line to the secondary burner.  I called Coleman again and had a nice long discussion with one of their their customer service ""Outdoor Experts"" (their phrase, not mine).  This ""expert"" tried to tell me that, since it is a two burner stove, you HAVE to have both burners lit to get the air/fuel mix correct and also to heat up the generator to sufficiently vaporize the fuel... It was everything in me not to scream into the phone.  After several ""brief holds of one-to-two minutes"" and ""speaking to his supervisor"" they finally agreed to turn me over to the warranty service (20 minutes later) for a new pump assembly this time.  Not sure if it will help, will update post after it arrives, but the amount of trouble I'm having with this stove is making me wonder what happened to the Coleman of old...",2.0
"I was replacing a 20+ year old Colman stove with this one since we had just about wore out the old stove.  The old stove still worked great, but it looked like a 20 year old stove and my wife hated that we cooked food on it.  It took two new stoves before I received one that wasn't bent out of shape.  Even the one I kept is not made as sturdy as my old stove.  The fit and finish are OK, but I doubt this one will last as long as my old stove.  The fuel tank does not line up and stay inserted into the burner nearly as well as the old stove and I'm constantly adjusting it while I'm cooking.  The pump on the fuel tank also does not have the feel of my old stove and it's hard to tell when it's pumped enough.  If there were any other alternatives to Coleman, I'd probably have given someone else a try, but they seem to have a corner on this market.  Too bad, since it appears they're resting on the laurels.  I wish I could have found a ""new"" old stove, I know I'd have been happier.",2.0
"Once a renown brand with good products, now lacking any sense of quality.

We bought that oven for 2 reasons

1. It's a dual fuel (unleaded Gas & Coleman fuel)
2. To use it together with the Coleman foldable oven

Pro:
YES, it heats up what you put onto it

Cons:
1. The gas tank does not hold in its slots (front side of the stove) and slips away - meaning we have to put something in front or underneath the tank to keep it in it's designated position.

2. At the first use, one of the gaskets (underneath one of the burners) blew off. The authorized Coleman service in Bowling Green, Kentucky asked us to get in touch with Coleman directly because

a) we have not bought the product in his shop and
b) this gasket fails so seldom that he does not have any stock

....not to mention, that this gasket is not even listed in the original Coleman manual.

3. It's wet out there - Using an outdoor stove means that there is a certain chance, that it gets wet. But it DOES NOT mean, that the oven has to start rusting immediately.

4. The jet on the tip of the fuel injection pipe got loose after the first use and produced a yellow flame. As the pipe is made of steel and the jet of brass or bronze, it goes without saying that this did not happen only once but several times (according to the user manual one should contact the Coleman service and not to operate the stove any further as a yellow flame is an indicator for a leakage)

Compared to our 25 year old Coleman stove (from a yard sales) this one looks pretty much like a more than cheap copy on which someone tried to gain the profit margins to the limit ..... and we talk here about a stove with a MRSP of $ 129,99 !!!!",2.0

"This runs very below my expectations. While the idea is OK, the implementation is quite flimsy. It certainly serves the purpose - helps keeping the things more organized, but keeps me wanting something else.

A sample of flimsiness - you can get two dividers betwixt two fingers and squeeze them together easily, no  efforts required; you shake the whole thing and it keeps dribbling for a few seconds.

"I purchased this unit from a local Sports Authority store. It has been used very sparingly by my son and I. We probably used it a total of 33 times for short (less than 15 minute) sessions. It goes through ""C"" batteries rather quickly, so make sure that you buy a large package of them (Costco?). It does have a 6 volt adapter plugin port. But, like most USA companies, the adapter is not included and you must shell out another $20 or so by buying one at Radio Shack or somewhere similar. One day we tried to start the unit and ""no-way Jos""--it wouldn't start. As I said, we use it very infrequently. Obviously, when it didn't start up, the unit was already out of the one year warranty period. Like most of the stuff made in China, the plastic parts (console housing and soft-touch panel where you push start all the functions) are very flimsy and apparently the membrane below the touchpad has bit the dust and is not transfering the start command to the next cricuit. The ""start/stop"" button no longer starts the system. So, the programming is not accessible. Now all I have is an eliptical without any programming. It just ""free-wheels."" I have contacted the manufacturer in an attempt to order a new console unit. However, like most factory replacement parts, it will probably cost half (if not more) of what a whole new unit will cost. Due to the short life of this Eclipse 1100 HR/A, I will not buy another Fitness Quest product. I would not recommend this unit to anyone based upon is short life span with below average use.

Added 11/13/2009: I heard from the manufacturer Power Quest on the cost of a new computer circuit board. They want $109.00 plus tax and shipping) for a new computer that will make this unit operable--maybe. Of course, there could be something else wrong with it too. Through our local CraigsList, you can purchase a used elliptical for around the same price. Guess which alternative I will take? You got it.

"The Eclipse 1100 HR/A trainer is priced reasonably for a home use elliptical trainer, but I must say I was kind of disappointed in the performance of this trainer. I am fairly petite at 5' 4"", and found the pedals awkward and hard to work even at the lowest level of resistance. Even though it only has a 15"" reach, for me, I am maxed out at that stride length. And the arm bars squeak while using, even with all hardware tightened as much as possible. It's ok, but I think there's better out there. I've come to the conclusion it's important to first try an elliptical on for size before purchasing sight unseen.",2.0
"The elliptical I received was not the one in the picture. The screen was completely different. The setup was pretty easy. When I started to use it, the speed and distance stayed at zero even though I was on it for a good few minutes. I tried to find some answers in the owner's manual, but all I found was a few workouts and nutritional facts. I emailed the company, and I am now waiting for a response. Besides the screen not working properly, it's a pretty good machine. It's not like the ones at the gym at all, but that's why you pay so little for it.",2.0
You get what you pay for.  This elliptical lasted for about two years before it broke.  I rode it just about every day for 30 +/- minutes.  I really had a hard time aligning the main column so that the left/right steps function correctly.  I will buy another elliptical but plan to upgrade.,2.0

I got the impression from Eclipse that this is a fairly common issue. The customer service rep knew exactly what I was talking about when I said ""The linkage below the foot platform has come loose"". Apparently there is no way to fix it and it requires a replacement by mail every time.

Eclipse is happy to send me a third replacement machine. Fortunately Amazon has decided to offer me a refund as an alternative.

"That is simply unacceptable! Granted it's not the most expensive unit out there but it should last more than a month.

I did like it's size and it was fairly unobtrustive and not hard to program or read (that gives it the extra star)

As for measuring steps it is not as accurate as I wanted anyway. When compared to the treadmill and elliptical machines, both of which give readouts of what you've done in your workout, this unit did not count all my steps. I wore it on the belt area/top of waist. It may be that mine was a dud and the battery was going from the beginning which is why the step count was off - but it really doesn't matter. I'm going to purchase a much better quality unit in the hopes it will last longer! I cannot possibly recommend this unit - although it does sound like others have had better experiences.",2.0
"This is a cheap pedometer.  I can't speak for how well it works because it broke less than 10 minutes after I opened it.  Setting it up was relatively easy.  There are no labels on the casing.

I snapped it back shut, but now it doesn't work.

It was my mistake to open the wrong  side.  But that would not have happened if the casing was clearly marked.  How hard can it be to clearly identify the side to open?  How about using some labels?

Let this be a warning when opening up this pedometer to check the readout.  If you try the wrong side, it opens too easily and never works again.  Poor design.",2.0
"I've purchased this pedometer twice now, and both have died on me after around a period of 1-2months each. Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a pair of duds, but really now... that's not acceptable by any standards. Aside from the horrid battery life on these things, the functionality is decent, simple, easy to use and setup. It's fairly accurate as soon as you find just the right sensitivity settings for the environment you plan to use it.

Final verdict, I haven't actually tried to replace the batteries yet, so I can't be sure if it's a device failure or if it's a battery failure. But I know for sure that I'll be searching for a different brand. For you consumers out there, if you're willing to risk having to replace the battery or possibly the whole unit, then this is a pretty solid cheap pedometer. Otherwise, I'd recommend doing some research and going for something more reliable and overall better quality.

"I have used pedometers before and they just show the number of steps.  I did not want or need a course in how to program a complicated system for computing many things in order to use the pedometer.  It matters not how long my strides are or how much I weigh.  All I want to know is how many steps I ordinarily do and then increase them to increase my lung capacity leg and back strength.  It builds self esteem and self confidence.

I will continue to use my old pedometer and try to program my new one, but the ones I bought for my husband and daughter to encourage them to more physical fitness will lie in a drawer with the instructions because it took too much time and effort to analyze.

Please quit trying to make things more digital and complicated when it is only a $12 item and wanted for one thing.

"I though that this was a good deal, and it didn't have the problems that I've had with other pedometers: weak clips, finicky performance, easily reset by accident. It was fine for over three weeks.

But then, it fell three feet onto a wooden floor -- I brushed against something, it fell off my belt -- and it's never worked properly since. The internal pendulum is somewhat jammed against something else inside, so now it won't reliably register my steps.

So while this pedometer has many advantages over other models in a similar price range, it was much more vulnerable to a drop on the floor than the others I've had.",2.0

"I received my whistle and ""Rescue"" is written in Red on one side.  There was no information stating that there would be words on the whistle.",2.0
"I'll go against the tide of these reviews a little.

This whistle is omnidirectional. It puts sound equally in all directions. That means, the one who'll hear it loudest is YOU. It seems like it blows sound right back at you. The by-design 'beating' or phasing action of the two barely-different notes (to replace the pea) doesn't help the pain. I have this crazy idea that a whistle should project sound AWAY from you!

Here are the whistle's weak points.

- It may be larger than is convenient for keychain (safety) carry. Smaller/flatter whistles are available.

- Like I said, it's nondirectional, so no one gets more of its whistle than you.

- ...Therefore, it not safe to the user, and isn't safety the main point? I can't believe most reviewers aren't mentioning hearing protection; I believe it's necessary for use in anything other than an emergency--and that to me is a bad design. Long-term use (like a referee, especially indoors) would IMO be stupid. Then again, it is sold as a safety whistle. When I wanted to hear test it, I learned quickly to clasp my hands over my ears. If you have to hold it with one hand (if it's on a heavy keychain), you'll need to use your shoulder to close off one ear. That's my biggest issue with it. ""Safety"", my eye. So, refs have the glorious options of wearing earplugs and looking like a dork but setting a good example, plugging their ears every time they use it, or slowly but permanently damaging their upper registers of hearing over time. ""Eh?"" Unlike guns, this one impacts both ears equally. So you won't be left with a ""good ear"".

- The omnidirectionality will actually reduce its relative volume to the person you're blowing ""at"". Also makes it difficult for others to tell who you're whistling at.

- The whistle takes a disappointingly large amount of air to blow loudly (or to even get it to make a whistling noise). There is hardly any resistance to your lungs. I was expecting to be able to really puff down on the thing, and work up some pressure. Nope. IOW, it is not ""efficient"". Yes, it's loud, but it takes a lot of air to get it there. I'm sure many people make short bursts effectively, but I think it'd be easier to tongue a staccato if there were more resistance.

Here are the strong points.

- It is actually well-made. Yes, it's plastic, but there's good and bad plastic. This is good stuff. I know, because I carried it on my keychain for years. The plastic bead the keychain loops through never broke. It's worn, and looks like it could break anytime (retired now), but the thing is still going. I had numerous other keychain items break at the joint, including coin cell flashlights. That's more of an honor than one might expect, knowing my keychain before I ""culled"" it.

- The phasing/""beating"" sound, which replaces the ""pea"" of traditional whistles, is a unique effect, if not irritating to the ears (especially to your own).

- It's almost disappointingly lightweight/lacking in heft. This is a good thing, as its levity betrays its good build quality.

- It's cheaper than some other high-end whistles.

- I think mine was made in USA, but I got mine years ago; could be ""Free Traded"" now.

I'm looking for a smaller (flatter), more directional, easier-to-blow whistle. Any suggestions, especially from those who've tried this? I saw an orange house brand ""Tri Whistle"" on REI's website, flatter, has 3 air outputs/phase beats vs 2, and made in USA; but has a cork pea, is fluorescent orange, and still hurts radiates sound at you. My use would be emergency (keychain everday carry or wilderness), not sports. If Fox makes a directional version of this, someone let me know? Or... Fox, make a directional version of this?",2.0
"I did not buy this compass, nor I would buy it, because, by just looking at the picture, I can see it is badly designed.

An intelligently designed compass should always tell you, in a natural, intuitive and logical way, which cardinal point is in front of you (and which one at your right, left and back). To achieve this, the compass should have a fixed arrow pointing forward (the car's direction), and on the head of this arrow should appear the true cardinal point to which the car is pointing.

For example, if the car is moving towards East, you would like to see E on the head of the forward pointing arrow, as the following picture shows:

FRONT OF CAR which is moving towards EAST
....E
N  ^  S  -=====WELL DESIGNED COMPASS shows E at front.
...W

but instead, on the advertised compass you will see this:

FRONT OF CAR which is moving towards EAST
....N
W > E  -=====PNI V700 badly designed compass shows N (instead of E) at front.
....S

Another example, if the car is moving towards South, you would like to see S on the head of forward pointing arrow, as following picture shows:

FRONT OF CAR which is moving towards SOUTH
...S
E ^ W  -=====WELL DESIGNED COMPASS shows S at front.
...N

but instead, on the advertised compass you will see this:

FRONT OF CAR which is moving towards SOUTH
.....N
W. v .E  -=====PNI V700 badly designed compass shows N (instead of S) at front.
.....S

A good design should have a fixed arrow pointing forward and rotating letters, as the following picture shows:

FRONT OF CAR when it is moving towards N, W, S and E respectively.
:::N:::: | :::W::: | ::::S:::::|  ::::E::::
W:^:E: | :S ^ N: | :E ^ W :  | :N ^ S:  ...In well designed compass arrow ^ always
:::S:::: | :::E:::: | :::N::::::| :::W::::  ...points forward, and letters N,W,S,E rotate.

The design error of PNI v700 compass, as the following picture shows, consists in having letters N, E, S, W fixed (painted)  on the frame of the compass and a rotating arrow which points to this letters, but no to the true physical direction towards the car is moving.

FRONT OF CAR when it is moving towards N, W, S and E respectively.
:::N:::: | ::::N::: | ::::N:::: | ::::N:::
W:^:E: | :W < E: | :W v E:: | :W > E:  ...In badly designed PNI v700, arrow ^ rotates
:::S:::: | :::S:::: | ::::S:::: | :::S:::: ...to point to fixed letters N,W,S,E

In few words, PNI V700 compass shows lack of intelligence and aesthetics in its design.",2.0

I got a seal pup several years ago and it's my favorite knife so I decided to order another.  The version I got his time had a plastic snap around the handle instead of metal and the overall sheath quality did not seem consistent with my previous purchase.  Returned this one.,2.0
Sheath has plastic snaps now.  One failed first time I tried to unsnap it.  Not good!,2.0
"After using this knife for a few weeks,  I had the blade snap at the handle while batoning a medium sized log. Upon inspection, I noticed it had snapped where a large hole had been drilled, right where the tang meets the exposed portion of the blade. This was probably put there to prevent handle wobble and to keep the molded handle on the knife, but wow... What a place to drill a hole. I then proceeded to test tip strength since the knife had already broke, and after sticking the blade into a tree, about 10 degrees of lateral bending caused it to snap. This knife would be good for simple cutting chores in the kitchen, but I wouldn't recommend it in the woods unless you have a backup knife ready to go.",2.0
The knife seems fine but the button snap on the sheath that retains the knife was broken upon receipt. The same cheap plastic button snap that is used on the front to hold the knife is also used for the MOLLE attachment on the back of the sheath which one would assume won't last long either.,2.0
"It is very lame that SOG traded quality and integrity of the brand for cheap Chinese manufacturing. I used to be a very big fan of SOG product I (have several of them and few SOG PUPs) - not anymore. #1 knife that you see on the picture on top with a gray blade  is a original design SEAL PUP made in Japan. I got that knife long time and it served me well for several years  and through several deployments to Afghanistan and multiple hiking trips also. It sustained a lot of abuse but stayed sharp and very functional. No issues with that one. However if you decide to order one now - you will receive Chinese replica that not even close to the original design. Moreover, SOG tricks customers putting a picture of original made in Japan design in the description while selling cheap Chinese duplicate. And only if you scroll down below - that the knife you will receive. So be aware what you buying. My personal advice as OEF OIF veteran and infantry NCO - don't waste your money. People who wrote positive reviews, possibly have nothing to compare with. If you know about knifes - you will be disappointed. I'm done with SOG. Next time I'm gonna need a knife I'll get Gerber strong-arm instead. The difference in quality is drastic.  I have attached pictures of my old SOG and new one that I just got in the mail. Look for yourself.",2.0
"I used to be a SOG fan.  I practically worshiped the quality and craftsmanship of their products.  However, how ever many years ago, SOG in my opinion went cheap.  Now they are made in Taiwan instead of Japan and again, in my opinion, the steel quality and control went to the dogs, there is no quality control for inspecting the grips and the tang, not to mention they are now made from a cheaper plastic that is poorly injection molded and a litany of other issues that are too many to mention in this review.  Again, this is my opinion and I can only base it on my experiences, and from what I can tell you: the SEAL trident knife that was made in Japan, I absolutely love, it is my go to knife for most jobs that require a knife of that size and scope.  The SEAL pup's ( and notice pup's is plural) I have purchased since have all been made in Taiwan and all three have either snapped in half at the hilt (under normal use for a knife), or the grips have fallen off the tang (again, under normal use).  I do not throw knives, I do not use them as pry bars or screw drives or etc... and yet these knives went from Great to Garbage.  In my opinion, buy yourselves a K-Bar or Emerson, or Buck (USA made Buck)  or Bench Made knife.  They can be more expensive but well worth it and you will own a knife that you can pass down to you kids and so on.  One final note: SOG is using AUS-8 steel... great for kitchen were and light duty use, not so great for heavy duty use.  Again, all in my opinion.",2.0
"Wanted to like this knife but The handle is pretty much hard and cheap plastic, feels like it will chew up your hand. Gerber prodigy is a better choice",2.0

"Good knife if you get the correct serial number.  Some are made with aus 6 steel and some are aus 8 from what several knife forums say.  I got one that supposedly has aus 6 but it says 8 on the package, I can't remember what the blade says.  The packaging was torn and cracked(not something that happened in shipping). The tip  cover was rattling around in the box also. I wouldn't have minded if it was for me but it was for my dad for Christmas so that kind of lessened the excitement for me.  He likes the k if though so I guess mission accomplished.",2.0
Reeeaaaaallllly cheap knife.  $12-15 knife at most...Made in Taiwan POS that SOG slapped its logo on and wants $37 on sale!,2.0
"I purchased this knife with the intention of using it as a dive knife. After 2 trips with 0 use under water, it rusted. I did remove it and dry it at the end of each day and oiled it at the end of the trip. I bought this knife because SOG advertised them as being highly resistant to rust. Mine was not.",2.0
Knife came in plastic cheap packaging. Seems like poor quality compared to my other knives in this series. Case is also not what I expected. Very cheap.,2.0
"Note, this is not a total review, but a major personal gripe for which is somewhat my fault. I have had my Pup for several years and have rarely used it, it looks amazing, and from every review I read seems to perform great. My issue is that I never tried holding one before I ordered from SOG, and I found out the hard way that the handle is extremely uncomfortable for me, and it is hard to keep a good grip on. The surface is rough but hard and slippery in my hand, and all the finger grooves are in the wrong location for my hand, my fingers end up mismatching into bumps in the wrong way which feel unnatural and leadme to constanly look down and shift my grip but to no avail to any comfortable way, and my thumb gets jammed uncomfortably into/over the tang. In short, I would not trust having this knife at all even for the woods, I would not trust being able to grab it quickly and bring it up without slipping my grip, or without dropping it over longer use because of what I find to be a slippery grip, and pain from holding. What was a bad knife for me may be a great one for you, as it seems for many, I just say, don't make my mistake, and try holding before you order.",2.0

I would have liked them better if they had a softer/rubber bottom so his efforts wouldn't mare my wood floors.

This was a Christmas present for my 5 year old son and while he loves it he can  not skate more than a foot without veering off to the right.  The wheels were put on crooked.  I think this is a great product but the assembly line  needs to be reviewed and improved.,2.0
"Skateboards are funny things.  For some, they are athletic tools and for others they are toys.  But for all, they need to have a basic functionality.  I was a little disappointed that the Hot Wheels Green Ride Skateboard purchased from Amazon was not really ready to ride when it was received.  Now since I sent it to Boise, ID and I live in Sioux Falls, SD, I could never have discovered the skateboards dysfunction, if it weren't for the serendipitous family reunion that occurred 3 weeks after the recipient's birthday.  I discovered that the skateboard had not been ridden, because it couldn't be ridden.  It had 2 wheels that were stuck because of overtightened bolts.  One of the Trucks was tightened so tightly that it was unresponsive to turning attempts when this 260 lb former skateboarder attempted to ascertain the lack of use.  The other truck was fine, but a skateboard requires 2 trucks to make a good turn.  I fixed the board and was finally able to introduce my nephew to a sport that I used to love, but this wouldn't have happen without an uncle's housecall.  From the store, this skateboard would have been left in the corner of a garage, providing no value for the investment.",2.0

"I loved this massive water container until it was easily punctured, by setting it down in a driveway, and slowly leaked gallons of water into my trunk during a 3 week road trip. I realize it's entirely my fault for it being punctured but I'm still not sure how it happened so easily.",2.0
I unfolded it from the box to use during hurricane irma and found the plastic cracked.,2.0
"I gave this two stars because it does one thing well, it holds water. The big problem is that it holds onto it far too well. If you are purchasing this to transfer water, it is horrible. The spout is small and it creates a vacuum in the tank, the result is that it takes about 45 minutes for this carrier to empty when it is hung by the handle and the valve is opened all the way.

We have a pop up trailer, and when we camp where there aren't water hook ups, we have to use something like this to haul water and refill the 25 gallon on-board tank. My system is to hang a carrier like this from a camera tripod and open the valve to drain the water into the trailer tank. I bought two of these so I could empty one while I was filling the other. Because these empty so slowly, it would take me close to 4 hours to fill the trailer.

The carrier I had before I bought these was from a company called Reliance, they are more expensive but it seems like the extra cost is 100% worth it for what I need this for.

I decided to add some pics of what I ended up doing. I went to Cal Ranch and bought 2' of braided vinyl hose with a 1"" OD, then I cut out the inside of the valve and stuck the hose through it. Now it empties in about 15-20 seconds and works like a champ, it doesn't shut off but for what I will use it for it works. I'm going to leave the rating at two stars because if I was purchasing this and was using it as it comes, it would SUCK!!!",2.0
"Read carefully, the spout does not work well. First camping trip I intended to use as a hand washing/ dishwashing station, not so much. Terrible flow, basically a leaking faucet. Ended up cutting out plastic in faucet for better flow. If you are okay with doing all that then I recommend. If not get a hard shell.",2.0
"Maybe I missed something, but the box contained minimal information.  I consider this jug the most stupid design I have ever encountered!  I was provided with a cord and S-hook.  IF there was a tree or post or something capable of bearing the weight, and IF I could reach such tree limb, etc, without a ladder, the cord and S-Hook would be very handy.  However, non such were available to me at my campsite.  Had I gone to the desert, I definitely would have been out of luck.  This jug is so floppy it will NOT stand up on its own.  I tried propping it against a support, but it just flops around like an unconfined water bed.  Perhaps I can rig something else for myself that would be a much better design:  a sturdy box with an opening cut for the spout.  That should do it. Oh wait - a milk crate would be just perfect!
Hey Coleman!  Why not invent a collapsible milk-crate like box to go with this flop-monster?",2.0
"The valve only let-out a small stream of water. Instead we more often took off the cap to pour out water. So pretty useless, expect to decrease number of trips to the water pump.",2.0
"I used this for three days on a camping trip I just returned from and won't be using it again. The faucet only lets a dribble pass, so there was no way to get it to give me a lot of water without waiting for a long time. I also doesn't maintain its shape.",2.0
"nozzle leaks, has fallen over i assume due to wave action and unstable base (flexible)",2.0
"I bought one of these about 25 years ago, and have nothing but positive things to say about that one. Back then, it was thin plastic, and cheaply made (in comparison to a more expensive plastic water jug), but I knew that when I bought it, so I took care of it. Over those 25 years, I used it frequently for camping trips, and it lasted a long, long time before it (finally) developed a small leak at one of the seams. So after that happy experience, I didn't hesitate to replace it with another Coleman carrier, and wow... what a difference 25 years can make. The new version is (somehow) even cheaper, flimsier, and of poorer quality than the old one. That's tough to do, considering the ""old"" version was pretty flimsy itself! But wow. Somehow... some way... they managed to make the plastic even thinner on the new version than it was on the old version... and that was pretty thin to begin with! Because of that, the cap and valve on the new one are all but useless. The plastic threads on the carrier itself (where the cap attaches) are made of such a thin plastic layer that they don't form a good seal, so the new one leaked around the cap the very first time I filled it. Also... the plastic is now so thin that I'd be afraid to set this down on a flat pebble, much less anything more abrasive! The water carrier I bought 25 years ago was pretty cheaply made, but in spite of that, I was very pleased with it. Now that I've bought the new version... I'm going to go back to my old one and try to patch the leak. Very disappointed in the ""improvements"" that have taken place in this product over the last 25 years.",2.0
Cracked after a few camping trips from just being folded and unfolded.,2.0
"these are not great.  expected more from a coleman.  if the spout isn't shut off just perfectly, it leaks.  there is no air valve on top, so it drips very slowly as it empties.  i would not buy again.  regret than i bought two.",2.0
"I've been using this whenever we camp, for the last two years. I would have given it 5 stars but the stream of the water flow was a huge downer for me. Call me impatient, but I don't enjoy standing there as long as I had to, just to fill a 16 oz. glass of water. So we basically just use this to wash our hands/face and brushing our teeth. We haven't had any problem with it rolling around or the flimsiness about it, but that's because we always hang it from a tree for easy access, and never used it on a table. It's probably flimsy so it can collapse for easy storage. I'm about to order a new one, and if the water flow wasn't so slow, I would have purchased this one again. But I'm trying a different one that looks like it has better flow.",2.0
"This container quickly imparts a vinyl taste and odor to the water. I treat it as ""non-potable"" water - that is, for washing hands, dishes, and the like. I have not experienced leaking, as other reviewers have experienced - but the flow rate is typically slow.",2.0
"spout did not work great.  1 trip and it goes in the garbage, however it did what we needed for the 1 week camping trip",2.0
"I was not impressed by this container. Unless you have the valve in exactly the right position at 90 degrees, it will leak. Then, when you turn the lever to ""open"" the water barely trickles out.  If you squeeze on the container it helps a little but not a lot. Overall, it does the job, just not very well. Would not buy again.",2.0
"Okay, so I thought this would be a great buy, because it collapses, and it is Coleman brand. I was wrong. So, so wrong! There is no pressure release valve on this water carrier, so guess what, the water just very, very slowly goes out the less water you have in it. Yeah, I could have manually released the pressure by setting it right side up and opening up the valve, but then what is the point? I was super glad we had others to use instead of this piece of junk.",2.0
"Jug was extremely flimsy.  Since it is not a hard plastic, it topples over very easily once it is half empty.  Found myself having to constantly pick it up off the floor.  The spigot works okay when it is full.  Once it is half empty, you have to pull on the top handle, while pouring the water/content out, in order for it to flow correctly.  Purchased it for a camping trip, but ultimately exchanged it for the Aqua-Tainer.",2.0
This doesn't have a breather so the water trickles out very slowly. Would not buy again.,2.0
We bought this and ended up returning it because it is definitely not going to last very long. We used it to hold water for washing dishes and it served the purpose but it just doesn't seem to be very well made.,2.0
"I bought two for a week long camping trip in the desert. Unfortunately one them tore a hole when placing it in the cooler (rubbed against the hinge of the cooler lid). It didn't take too much to scuff a hole, then it just deflated from there. Had to survive the week with half of the water. The other one worked well, although knowing it is somewhat fragile, I was very careful with it. Probably great for many uses, but mine wasn't very durable.",2.0
Broke after one use,2.0
These are good for storing water but when it comes to using the spigot it does not flow well. I ended up unscrewing the entire cap to pour the water out. I purchased 2 carriers and have used  them 2 weekends so far. I may poke a little hole in the top handle so the water will release?,2.0
"I cannot bring myself to give this a 1 star rating because it technically does what it claims to do. It does hold 5 gallons of water, it does have a spigot and the handle does support it's weight...at least for the short distances over which I've carried it. The spigot was so slow that I decided to leave it in the car when walk-in camping for mare convenient refills of a 1 gallon jug that I pack in the 1/2 mile to the camping site. I would return the item, but I didn't pay enough for it to be with the effort of a return.",2.0
Very difficult to manage when filled.,2.0
"Just ok.  Very heavy, spigot doesn't work well and rolls around.  Love Coleman and the idea it folds up but this isn't a good design.  I'll use one more time then use a recycled dish detergent jug for washing up at the campsite.",2.0
"In my opinion, it's better than nothing but not by much. There are weak points where the plastic is clearly thinner than in other areas, the spigot doesn't flow much and it's a pain to fill by yourself. Picture filling a 5 gallon garbage bag with water through an offset 2 inch opening with one hand and that's a pretty good description of how it works. Similarly, it sits on whatever surface you intend to put it on like a water-filled garbage bag. Honestly, if you're looking for something like this, spend a few extra dollars and get one that has a rigid body rather than this flaccid sack of aggravation.",2.0
"Came out of the box with a tear in the seam. When you open the spout don't expect a steady stream to come out, instead expect a nice drip.",2.0
One of the two broke the first time it was used not good for hauling in crowded vechicle,2.0
"OK I have used this product for 3 years, on 4 camping trips, and the verdict is in...Pass on This! Yeah it hold 5 gallons, but..it is TOO floppy. It frequently rolls of the picnic table onto the ground and gets covered in dirt, (GOOD POINT it doesn't break when it falls over) however the ""Faucet tap"" does! When it fell on our last trip, the faucet broke. And it leaked from day one (At the faucet) Unless you NEED something flexible, and collapsible, get a hard container...WE did.",2.0

My five year old grandson never got to see it.  My daughter made me return it saying it was notorious in the emergency rooms for children having accidents.  It looked like fun.,2.0
Totally disappointed... I bought it for my 6 yrs old for xmas but unfortunately he was not able to ride it cause one of the handles is bend,2.0
This is really hard for a little kid to ride and requires a lot of stability.,2.0
Bought it in September and we had trouble with the latch right away. It took several tries before being able to fold it. Yesterday it refused to fold altogether so my kid could't put it in her locker at school. Disappointing.,2.0
"Started out with a 5 star. I bought this for my daughter due to the look with the tassels. They just fall out. In fact, one side is completely gone. Very poor construction on this feature. Might as well bought one without them as now my daughter is sad!",2.0
Grandson loves his scooter but the folding mechanism does not work easily.,2.0
eh could have been way better,2.0
One month and all the tassels have fallen out :(,2.0
"Wish I would have invested in the micro-mini like I did for my other kids. It holds up wheel but the steering is loose and hard to maneuver for my 4 year old daughter, plus I'm worried about about the metal frame with the younger children. Probably a better product for a 6 year old or older",2.0
Terrible quality and very wobbly- my 5 year old and a few of his friends had fallen off at least once and hurt themselves. Returned this after 2 weeks.,2.0
Not very smooth. The platform is too small.,2.0
"It's too small for my 6 years old, so I returned it",2.0
"cheap quality, 6 yr old rode for 3 weeks and bolts were falling off of it, he weighs almost nothing,  very cheap, not like the others from a few yrs ago that all my other kids have,  just like everyone else trying to make things cheaper and cheaper forgetting about customer satisfaction...",2.0
"Just like every other Razor Kick Scooter I see in our neighborhood (and that's probably about 30 of them)...the handlebars spin out of sync with the front wheel and have to CONSTANTLY be tightened and manipulated to get them back to straight. I do maintenance on my daughter's scooter on average about twice a week. She's only 4-and-a-half years old, so it's not like she's abusing it and doing heavy tricks or freestyle on it. The end caps of the hand grips popped out of the handlebars within 3 weeks of receiving the scooter. Now the grips are fraying at the end exposing the metal handlebar at the end (an increased injury risk in the event of a crash).

The only redeeming quality of the Razor Kick Scooters are that they are more portable than the pro-style scooters because they do fold up. Basically, I bought this as a starter scooter for my daughter to use and abuse at a low cost to see if she would really enjoy riding and using a scooter before investing in a more expensive pro-style scooter.",2.0
"Junk...front tire bearings broke after 2nd month of use...just after Amazon's return window closed.  Item can't be returned, repaired or otherwise used.",2.0
Steering on this is way off. Very disappointed,2.0
"Bought this for my daughter to replace a kickboard mini micro scooter that she grew out of. Her school used these in her gym class so she was excited to move up to the bigger scooter for bigger kids etc... Guess what - she didn't like it. It's a great scooter in a gym with a perfectly smooth floor and it's super cheap. But all that cheapness becomes very apparent if you try and use it outside on the playground or sidewalk. It is very ""rattley"" and hard to hang on to. The wheels are basically too small and it has no give or shock absorption at all.

So if you need to buy 30 scooters for use in a gym - get these. If not - I recommend:
http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B004RP1COW
- yeah - it's way more expensive - go get a used one - all the parts are also replaceable.",2.0
Fun while it lasted.,2.0
"Works well, but is horrible horrible horrible to fold.  Definitely does not work like it should, even after looking at the manual and three You tube videos.  I bought 3 and all of them are horrible to fold.  When it does fold, I have no idea how I did it and it feels like luck.",2.0
I bought this scooter for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She loves the color and the tassels and the bell. Butthe tassels started falling out immediately and are now sprinkled all over our neighborhood. Half of them are gone and they make a huge mess. So my rating is an average of my score (0 stars) and my daughter's score (5 stars).,2.0
The handle bars were deformed so I had to beat on it with a hammer to get it to fit,2.0
Grit Fluxx is much more expensive and stable... razor is not,2.0
"My daughter had her previous Razor scooter for about 5 years, and it worked great the entire time. When it became apparent that it was finally too small, we bought her this new one.  It was purchased in September of last year and ridden occasionally. Last week, she was riding it at the park, and pieces began coming off. The cotter pin, the bolt thing that goes through it, the spring... We had to go on a major hunt to locate all the missing pieces. Fortunately my husband was able to repair it - however, for the retail cost of these scooters, I find it inexcusable that they can fall apart so easily!",2.0
Just okay. Folding mechanism is difficult. My 5 year old can't do it. I had to fiddle around for 10 minutes to figure it out.,2.0
To small for listed ages,2.0
Too small.  Send it back,2.0
The Razor is great but I was missing the tool that was suppose to come in the box. I ordered 3 and all three are missing the little wrench,2.0
The handlebars constantly loosen which makes the wheel misalign with the scooter. We have had to take it to the bike shop dozens of times for realignment.,2.0
main product package was ripped so its not a brand new product.,2.0
"So this is my 4th Razor purchased and the 1ST ONE I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH!!! I see why the price is lower- you get lower QUALITY!!! 1) black part near the front wheel broke in 2 days!!! And this is used by a 4yr old!  2) I have to constantly tighten the rings on the front as it loosens which causes the wheel to not stay straight! How ridiculous a walk to the park (2 blocks away) and I have to tighten it the minute we get there.  3) The foot placement is much smaller, this is ok for my 4 yr old but my older son says there is no room for the other foot!  I have the other 3 which where all purchased years ago- and although they look beat up- THEY WORK!!!! WITHOUT BROKEN PARTS!!! UGH!",2.0
"I purchased two  Razor Cruiser Scooters for 5 year old twin grandsons yesterday.  After riding scooter for two hours,
I had to tighten Collar Clamp four times on each scooter.  I am sure it was not lack of strength that caused
them to get loose.  Before I return them, has anyone else had this problem?  I paid $24.95 each.  Do I need
to buy a heaver or more expensive scooter?",2.0
"Now we have two of these scooters purchased at different times.  The first one was purchased in March and is just fine, works great so far. We purchased a second one, it arrived and then broke within days.  We tried to rig it to work because we were leaving for a trip we bought it to take on(great for a trip because it folds compact unlike a bike). My kid just keeps coming to me with more pieces that fell off his scooter. He's devastated! My kids love these scooters but the last one we received is just JUNK!",2.0
Broke a week later I know kids can be rough but I would expect it to out last a 8 year old girl by more than a week,2.0
Its ok i thought it was but my son sold it i guess fr a younger kid under 11 it will be great....,2.0
"Granted, my 6 year old has probably spent 40 hours riding this since she got it for Christmas, but the streamers on the end have already popped off, and so did the lever that raises the handle up and down. For the price, I guess it's to be expected.",2.0
"Product seems to be ok. Had my 8 year old test it and he managed to break the handlebar cover after having it for 34 days. Cover seems a little cheap. Not sure if I'm blaming the company for my son's fault. Still, 34 days since purchase, and the Razor company can't let go of one handlebar cover for customer service. The company did offer to waive postage and only charge $10 for the replacement. Was told it would be the same on their website, plus a postage charge. Had to pass. Don't really want to give them more money at this point.",2.0
"Just got the Razor after having the Mini Kick for 2 years.
I'll start off by saying that the Razor is not as stable as the Maxi Kick is.
Furthermore, it's really annoying that when you want to put it down, it often crashes to he floor and doesn't stand on it's own like the kick did.
I feel that my 5 year old goes much faster on the Kick than she does now on the Razor and seems a bit wobbly (maybe because it's new and 2 wheels instead of 3 like the Kick had. The ride seemed smoother before also.
Overall the Razor looks nice but I don't think it compares at at all to the stability and durability of the Kick.",2.0
"We owned a Razor scooter for several years before we purchased this one. That thing was indestructible and while it took serious abuse it functioned perfectly. We would have it to this day if it had not been stolen. We bought this one to replace the stolen one. From day one it would not fold properly and the handle would not lock fully. We sent it back and got a new one thinking we got a defective one. The second one had the same problem. Because my son uses the scooter almost daily to get to school and around the neighborhood, he did not want to send it back and wait for a replacement yet again. So, now we just never fold it up which, is a bit inconvenient living in a New York City apartment. My advice is go to a store with your kid and have them try several models, opening and closing them to see if they can do it consistently before making a purchase. C'mon Razor bring back the quality!",2.0
"I bought this for my daughter and it is already broken. I asked her wehat happen and she said "" I was just riding it and it stopped turning"".....something inside the base of the handle bars has shifted out of place and she can no longer ride it :( we can try to fix it I suppose but after having the scooter for 11 days we should NOT have to be fixing it.",2.0
pretty much everything broke within a month or some.,2.0
cord twist to bad to use for any length of time,2.0
Broke after second use.,2.0
The kit comes with two cables and the first one broke the first day. The second is still holding strong. The net around the dribble practice kit has also ripped open. Not a high quality kit.,2.0
"Simple product, easy to set up. But the bungee cord included is flimsy and breaks easily - and this is just with a 12-year old user.",2.0
"Bungee cord snapped in two, 20 minutes after setup. I tried to re-tie the cord, but it only snapped again. Not satisfied at all with this product as a training device.",2.0
"It was fun while it lasted, but you really can't use it if the bungee breaks! We had only used it a couple times to train a newbie player how to properly kick. It just didn't last very long. Too bad.",2.0
"The concept of this tool is really good. We enjoyed practicing with it a lot. We were able to kick the ball at least 500 times, some times more than 20  shots in a row...
Unfortunately the cord broke the first time we practiced. I had to attach it several times. My son is 12y and he broke it 2 or 3 times, and he cannot be that strong!!!
I think that the cord is too short, so the shot has a lot of power in a short distance, that's why it broke...
Now I have to buy a new cord and I have to spend more money, even if I think I paid enough to have a more durable product.

The corkscrew anchor is a very useful tool!",2.0
"Although I agree with one reviewer here about the lack of menu control on the DVD, I also agree that it is one of the best programs I have ever used.  I own the DVD which contains the 1-mile, 2-mile and 3-mile programs.  For a beginner, the warmups and cool downs may not seem long enough (I solve the cool down problem by walking around the house slowly until the sweat stops dripping) but once you are conditioned, the warmup will be enough; otherwise, you could pause it and continue to walk in place until you feel you are sufficiently warmed up and then continue the tape.  I think it is one of the most effective workouts out there.  I especially love using the belt.  It increases the challenge and really works well on my arms, back and breast/chest muscles.  I haven't really noticed as much of an effect on my waist, hips and legs as I do on my arms and calves but I am sticking with this one because I feel that I will see results with continued use. I am firmer all over and have much more energy. It is not a speedy weight/inches loss program.  It has been the most effective I have used since the Buns of Steel tapes of the late 80's/early 90's.  I think the music has appropriate timing for whatever movement you are doing at the time and fun because it isn't music I would buy or listen to normally but works with this workout program.  I don't mind Leslie's chatter.  She loses count a little because of her talking but I don't mind.  I like the way the walkers seem to be having fun and they are all attractive but not overly attractive, certainly not as unattractive as those in the awful Sexy & Fit After 40 program (had to sneak that in). Leslie interacts with each of the walkers.  The tape shows varying degrees of fitness.  Mostly they are all fit even if Jo appears to be a little heavy.  It is a tape that I look forward to performing at least 5 nights a week. Leslie does a good job of demonstrating the moves before you perform them.  The only error I find in her instructions is that she doesn't warn you from the beginning to pace yourself and not to attempt every move they do if you are not conditioned.  Once you are conditioned and accustomed to the pace, you will want to move up in the miles.  I am ready for 4 miles. I use this tape to prepare for the annual breast cancer walk.  It really is a great tape.  I did not give it a 5 because of the lack of menu control, Leslie not giving a warning early and often about pacing yourself.  One other complaint I have applies to many exercise tapes and that is that there is not a list of accessories necessary to perform the routine.  I did not see the outside rear of the box when I purchased this item and so wasn't aware of needing the belt before watching it the first time.  I wouldn't pay $30 for one level of this program.  I bought the 3 level DVD for $10.  I bought the Bally belt for $8 plus shipping on Amazon.  Great buy all around.",2.0
"At first this bottle was working well for me; it is lightweight and the perfect size, but even after regular washing of both the bottle and the cap, black mold developed on the cap and no amount of washing, soaking or scrubbing will remove it. My water now tastes like mold.
Not surprisingly, other brands of caps will not fit the sigg bottle, and the cost to buy a new sigg cap is almost as much as the water bottle.
I do not recommend this product.",2.0
Too plain. The black is not glossy. Don't like it.,2.0
"I purchased this, because I don't like to use disposable water bottles.  I used it for several months.  Eventually, the mouth area began to rust.  I had to stop using this bottle.",2.0
"Not a fan of these anymore. The liner wears and chips and customer service does not get back to any requests. After the first one chipping, I ordered another on my own dime as I liked the bottle. The second liner as started wearing away. Scrapped both of them and changing to a different company. The bottle does dent for any decent drop or impact.",2.0
"I like the bottle, but it got beaten really fast. Lasted less than a month.",2.0

"I have mainly stayed away from the stainless steel water bottles for the reason that they simply lose temperature through the bottle.  Cold water loses it's ""coldness"" and instead conducts this to the bottle, making it very cold to pick up.

After removing all plastic from my beverage and food storage life, I was left to revisit this issue.  I read a lot about which water bottles were the absolute safest, toxin free, lowest chemical options.  Sigg came up a lot.  I thought that maybe sigg would be different than others I had tried in the past.  Nope, I was wrong.  Same old, same old.

I did eventually find the Hydroflask Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle.  This bottle kicks the Sigg to the curb.  I live in Texas and I can leave my Hydroflask in the car all day and the water will still be cool!  And, there is absolutely no effect on the temperature at the bottle surface.  I bought two and one for my girlfriend.

Do not waste your money on the standard sigg.  I do not know if they have bottle with an insulated outer covering, but the regular just does not cut it.",2.0
"Was expecting to receive a bright, rich color bottle and one that keeps my beverage cold. These bottles are expensive so my expectations are high but the bottles I received were faded and ""washed out"" looking and didn't do well to keep beverages cold due to not being insulated.  They do avoid having a tin taste but doesn't help much when your cold beverage is no longer cold.

Go with Hydroflask bottles for a truly insulated bottle that keeps beverages cold.",2.0
I sent it back because of it's size.  I have a sigg water bottle that I have been using and I really like it.,2.0
"I'm not a huge fan of this bottle. I stopped using it when the coating started to wear off after putting it in the dishwasher. I like a larger opening to clean it myself. My husband still uses the bottle, but I wouldn't buy another one. I found a similar size nalgene bottle that I like a LOT better!",2.0
"The bottle I bought from here has a smell and it cannot go away with several times of washing. However, the other Sigg products I ordered were not like that.",2.0
Sigg bottle is fine- however the seller failed to mention that it wasn't a plain bottle. Has a large text image on the side of it. I wouldn't have bought it If I knew,2.0

Loved this bottle the first day, and then the second, but on the third the inside lining started peeling off. And let me tell you there is nothing worse than taking a drink from your water bottle only to end up with some little rubber pieces floating around your mouth. Im back to using my old bottle... I would have only given it one star, but it is still a damn good lookin bottle and I cant bring myself to throw it away.",2.0
I opened the package to a bottle with a gray surface area completely covered in white cloudy streaks encompassing the entire circumference. I persisted to scrub with metal cleaners but yet these streaks did not dissipate. To sell a product that is not polished or aesthetically pleasing confuses me.

Water bottle is very nice.  Sturdy and light.  Unfortunately it arrived with several small but very noticeable dents in the side.  We were not impressed when we opened the box.,2.0
"I returned this bottle because it was all dinged up and scratched.  Honestly, it looked like it had been through Iraq before it got to me in LA.  I didn't reorder because it seemed like it would damage easily, and for over $20 I think it should stand up to a little abuse. I've been washing and reusing a glass bottle that one of those fancy, sugary teas come in.  It's just as good if not better for for the environment.",2.0

Microphone piece fell out. Unable to reinstalled and is left dangling from wire. Does not offer any hearing protection for that ear anymore. Looking for information on any type of warranty.,2.0
"These were govt issue for me and my mates.  In short order, the foam that covers the microphones was torn or came off on all of them.  Replacing batteries is a pain because you have to pry off and re-attach both ear cups to replace the 2 batteries on each side.  Then the  cheap plastic that covers the wire headband separated.  Lastly, both volume knobs on each side were so flimsy and poorly designed they would turn on easily during transport and drain the batteries.  Recommend a headset that has ""a single"" volume knob that's recessed to help prevent it from turning on during transport, microphones that are also recessed, and which has a single or double ""exterior"" battery access.",2.0
"worked ok, but was  really uncomfortable. one of the straps is cheap plastic that will definitely break with any sort or normal weekly/monthly use.

I've been pleased with the kind that has small disc canisters and have only one head harness for the mask strap.",2.0
"About what I have come to expect for the price.  Generally poor sound quality and noise protection is just acceptable. I'm writing this after trying to use them at the gun range as an instructor, after several hours of use they are uncomfortable to the point of being painful. Loud rifle fire is borderline loud. I have replace them with a pair from MSA huge quality improvement.",2.0
"This mask lasted about 6 months before the thin plastic strap holder broke. The mask worked ok while it lasted but MSA should have known to use better quality material where the mask would be tightened.

 I only used the mask about once a week so there is no excuse for it to have broken so easily.

I contacted the company but was told I would have to pay 15 dollars for another plastic replacement part. When a company refuses to stand behind their product  it's not a good sign.

I would recommend to anyone in the market to look elsewhere.",2.0

"Disappointed in the quality.  I have worn dual-comm Peltors before, and while I didn't expect the same quality in a lower-end model, I did expect more than this.  I felt as though I might break it trying to put in the batteries.  It wasn't as comfortable as other earmuff earpro I have worn.  And  the sound quality coming through the speakers was not high enough for me to be confident that the pair I had was working properly, although it did effectively cut out when firing a 12-gauge (hence 2 stars).  Returned.",2.0
I like these for the slim fit but for noise cancellation I can find Better for the price. Walmart has Champion brand for about half the price that works better only thing is champion is bulky,2.0
It was very good while it lasted.  I used  this mask 3 times then the  plastic strap buckle broke at the corner; it broke when adjusting the straps. this seems to be the weak link the mask set up .  ( very thin plastic )  reinforce the corners in the plastic where the  strap goes through and you will have a excellent mask.,2.0
"Eh. Watch the youtube video on all the modifications you need to make to correctly use these ear protectors when you use a rifle. Also, it is a pain to put batteries in. Poor Design",2.0
"Great hearing protection, but battery changes are ridiculously hard to do.",2.0
This proiduct Worked the 5 times I used it  then the plastic head strap broke off so now its useless,2.0
Really a huge hassle to add & remove the batteries. And they easily could have made it another way to make this whole process better. The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. I don't understand how so many others like this product.,2.0
"I've had these for about 10 years, they are old design.  They used to be top of the line and very expensive.  Now they are no better than some $30 models.  The pros: slim design, individual volume knobs for each side.  Negatives- they are always turning themselves on.  I have to replace the batteries almost every trip to the range if you forget to double check they are off when you last put them away.  Trying to pry off the ear pieces to get to the batteries means your screwdriver will slip and cut open the vinyl covers.

After 10 years, the battery contacts and circuit board are corroded enough that once side quit working.  They do get a lot of sweat in there from wearing them.

I'm going to get the Peltor Tactical Sport next with the auto-off feature.",2.0
"the product comes in a plastic shell. looking through the plastic packaging, i could see scuff marks on the filters and dirt on the mask portion. when i opened up the package, there was a hair on the inside of the mask.  -1 star for this.

i don't like the fact that this product does not come with a factory seal. anyone can open the package and close it and you wouldn't notice. you could get a used product and you wouldn't know. someone could swap the filters for used ones and you wouldn't know. not acceptable for a safety device of such high importance and for something you have to put on your face, over your mouth and nose. this device should come in a package that can't be opened without damage to the actual package. i don't have faith in the device because of this issue. the product may be a high quality product but its package ruins the experience for me. -2 stars for this. i think i will return it.",2.0

"Brunton has a reputation for excellent products - unfortunately the 8099 Eclipse compass does not meet that reputation.

There are other higher quality compasses in the same price range so I returned this compass for a refund. Too bad - I liked the functionality but the quality just isn't there.

However, I received a regular Eclipse Compass instead (big difference as far as special features used professionally). When I tried to resolve this with Amazon, they told me that this was the product listed on the order so there was nothing they could do except issue a refund. I feel that I was mis-lead when I purchased the item and that there was no effort to resolve THAT problem, so I am left with a compass that I cannot use for work and have to go through the process of returning it and ordering a new one.

"Been using a set of Peltor 6s since 1999. My old pair gave up the ghost after 13 years. The new ones are nice but they seem to eat batteries in the left side.

5/15 Update:
Right side muff doesn't work.  The quality of these things has gone down hill, way down hill.  Talked with a 3M Peltor rep at a trade show, she said it would cost way more to have them fixed than to replace.  She recommended their comtac muffs.  Those are $500!  Ridiculous!  My 16 year relationship with Peltor's products is over.  Going to try MSA.",2.0
"These are the cheapest, entry level, electronic muffs from Peltor. Anyone expecting these will be as good as a $300 set of MSA Sordin's or even $300 Peltor's is dreaming. They perform just like you'd expect a $50 product that does the same task as a $300 product.... poorly.

To save costs they have a unit in each ear which means turning 2 things on. It means double the batteries too.

Circuitry is cheap and cut off is noticeable.

Quality of construction is cheap and comfort is somewhat compromised.

NRR is a very low 19. around the lowest in class.

The only good thing is they are very low profile so good for rifle shooting where you need to get a decent cheek weld.

Probably the only other positive is price. But if you want decent hearing protection, save another $50 and buy the Peltor Tactical Sport instead. They are $90 but actually very decent.",2.0
"Almost impossible to change the batteries with your hand, need a screw driver to pop the covers off despite the confusing instructions! Also very easy to turn the switches on when storing the ear phones, so when you use them the next time the batteries are dead. I'd buy the $200+ ear phones if I had to do it again!",2.0
"was tracking you could hook icom up to it not the case. eight more words are required, three more words.",2.0
"These work great at first.  However, after about the fifth use, and only about two months after I bought them, the left microphone stopped working, and yes I checked the batteries.

"I looked for the old, trusted quality of the Silva Ranger that i have used professionally for many years.  However, Rangers now are apparently no longer made in Sweden, but are now Made in China and no longer have the same quality, not recommended by many sites.  So, my hope was to get the same Swedish quality of the old Ranger i was used to and apparently that quality was in the new Swedish made Brunton type 15.  I received the compass from Beach Audio and was surprised to see it is Made in China, too.  So, don't know what is going on, but buyer beware.  However, from what i can see, currently, this Chinese Brunton is good; smooth turning dial, and quick to set needle.  I am just disappointed because i don't really trust a Chinese made precision tool, especially when i specifically got this Brunton to avoid ""Made in China"".

-- Ok, a follow-up: i called Brunton and apparently they make a lot of their compasses in China, including the 15TDCL.  Other compasses they have are actually made in the U.S.A.; their office being located in Wyoming.  So, the idea floating around that Bruntons are good because they are made in Sweden is false.  The real question is, are they just a good being made in China; that still remains to be seen by me.  The nice customer service person i spoke to said that the quality is still the same be it China, Sweden, or USA, and that Brunton will be happy to address, fix, replace any defects in quality and craftsmanship; China or not they do come with a lifetime warranty.  So, do what i did, and shop around and buy cheap.  I got mine here at Amazon for about $35 and on Brunton's website the same one (also Chinese made) was $80.",2.0
"I have had these Peltor 6s muffs since April.  They were purchased to replace a pair of Dillons (Made by Peltor) that were over 10 years old.  The old Dillons still work, but are in disrepair due to long hard use.

I expected the Peltor 6s to be on par, or better than the old product.  Not so.  The battery installation procedure is a pain.  The sound amplification is not nearly as good as the old pair, nor is the sound attenuation.  Now the right muff has developed static.  I am returning these muffs for refund and will replace them with another brand.  What a shame, Peltor has had a reputation for good quality products in the past.",2.0
replacing the batteries was a real issue and I punctured the ear membrane twice. Have since bought the upgraded ones and so far they are better in function and ease of battery replacement. They are also more effective is cancelling noise and easier to initially adjust. The top is very hard and I had to add a cushion so that they were comfortable. They were light and did not affect my shooting the shotgun.,2.0
"I have owned these for just under six months. In that time I have replaced the batteries six times. The POWER ON LED's have never worked. The left muff now has a noticable static/crackle when active. I agree with the ill concieved battery placement. If I had known about the battery situation from the beginning, I never would have bought them. You have to remove the ear cushion to get to the battery. Because of the tight fit, you have to push against the electronics to get enough purchase to pop them off. A small notch on the outside so a screw driver would have helped.

That all said, the low profile is the main reason I purchased these muffs and they deliver in that regard. They do not interfere with my rifle stock.",2.0
"Got these for my husband as he was looking to get a new ear protection for the range... had lots of good and bad reviews but like most things its best to test it yourself.
First impression WOW very compact and super sturdy...instructions were a bit iffy on the battery needed. they could specify its needs AAA battery but other than that its great. Tested it out real fast in the garage banging a hammer against metal and it was great. Tested speech which had no problems at all. Highly would recommend this to anyone.

Now the bad parts. Took them to an indoor range wearing them outside the shooting area sounded great, walked in and hear a BANG from a 9mm was like umm ok. Kept walking towards the lane and hear another .40cal go off had ringing in my ears. Right away I got out went grabbing regular nr25 slim protectors and it was a major difference. You must wear additional ear plugs using this at least for indoor range or anything powerful. Also no light for on and off light.

Buy something else. Only reason it got 2stars for quality of build.",2.0
It won't work at a shooting range. Maybe the microphones responding to slow. A slower sound will react better but this one does not work at a range,2.0
Works for the range. Wouldn't really like it in combat. Good for the money. Six more words required to hit submit.,2.0
"Ok these things work
but I have had them  amonth now and still can not find where to put battery in

i would not buy again

no support online anywhere

I have another pair of electronic ear protectores that I Will look to buy a more of

 not these.

And where and how do you put batteries in these?????",2.0
I purchased a total of 5 units and one of them did not work from the get go...we were in training for 4 days and had no choice but to use a broken set....Amazon did do an excellent job on refund...,2.0
"I tried these on at the store and they seemed great. I guess I should have read the reviews here more before buying them. I bought these to use for trap/clay shooting and was not very happy at all. #1 they do not block the sound very well, #2 there was a slight delay until they shut off loud sound, and when I turned them up I heard a faint hissing. Being used to foam earplugs, they felt & sounded a lot different. I could have gotten used to all the shortcomings if they fit better, meaning, when I mounted my shotgun they would hit on the stock. It was very distracting, even if I could have adjusted the fit or my mount slightly, it was too distracting to be worth dealing with. I didn't even shoot a full line, maybe 1 or 2 posts, max and took them off & sent them back. Thank goodness Amazon has an excellent return policy!",2.0
"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units, and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me, especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all, so label me only partially biased in sound quality.

There are better options, and if they weren't on sale, it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries, I cant get the things out.",2.0
"Found a problem right off the bat:  very difficult to remove hard band from inside of metal cup to install batteries.  Multiple slips of small screwdriver while trying to pry off 'hard' band from metal case punctured soft band.  Manual suggestive method did not work at all.

You should know that 2 AAA batteries are required for each earphone.

I have not tried with shooting yet, but now that batteries are installed, I plan to shoot this afternoon.  Afterwards, I will further review.",2.0
"I really like the Peltor hearing protectors and they work great. They fit better than some other brand that I have.  However the one bad drawback to the design is that the batteries are very difficult to get into.  One must pry off the ear pad then replace the batteries underneat.  I cannot do it with my fingers alone because the flange nearly cuts into my skin.  I must use a screw driver.  Surely there is a better design.  I hate this about them. If one has arthritis, you can't do it. I have lost some muscle strength after taking statins for cholesterol and I cannot do it with my fingers.",2.0
"The battery access (it doesn't come with any) is absolutely stupid. I guarantee you will be breaking the plastic muff ring after it's aged and dried out for 2 years.  I had to view an independant online video on battery replacement because it required a massive amount of effort to unsnap the muff cover the get at the battery compartment, and I'm very surprised it didn't crack in half. PASS.",2.0
replacing the batteries is kind of  challenging  . the speak function is interment . bottom line is you get what you pay for..,2.0
"To put in batteries is difficult.  The ear pads you have to take off are plastic and foam.  Very hard to take off, too easy to tear up.

The product literature says the unit provides effective ear protection only if the foam pads are in good shape.  It further says that the foam pads have a lifetime of about 6 months.",2.0
"I bought this item to replace an aging discolored Suunto that is similar for charting topography maps. It arrived with the package damaged and the compass damaged. I contacted the company and they issued a refund after 1st offering to send me a replacement. If it couldn't survive shipping it certainly isn't tough enough for what I've put my Suunto through over the years, and this is made in America. So I declined a replacement and was quite pleased they refunded my purchase as I was just willing to just eat it financially as it was cheap cost and not worth the cost of returning. The compass went in the garbage but Trail Explorers Outpost is a great company with great customer service. I definitely would order something from this company again but one experience with Brunton compass toughness will insure I never buy a Brunton compass ever again.",2.0
"I've owned a few Brunton Compasses. Why ""a few?"" I volunteer for a local S.A.R. organization. Over the years I have discovered that ALL of their liquid filled compasses WILL develop an air bubble in a short period of time. Even my 8099 has one. Sure, in the owners manual, they say that if a bubble develops it does not effect the accuracy and it is easily removed... Only to reappear (they don't mention) after about an hour or so. I would stick with a decent Silva. Rare to have any problems with the ones I've owned.",2.0
"The Brunton Nexus Star is a low-cost, fairly rugged, basic compass.  Like any low-cost compass, if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go, but it lacks features you may later wish you had.  On the plus side, it is lightweight, inexpensive, and fairly thin, so it doesn't take up a lot of room in your pocket.  On the minus side, the baseplate is very short, so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing.  The biggest disadvantage, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a true declination adjustment; it is advertised as having a ""declination scale"" which is not the same.  On a baseplate compass, you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the North Reference Indicator (sometimes called the ""Doghouse"") etched on the bottom of the vial.  Compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this ""Doghouse"" to align it with the desired declination.  That way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the Doghouse.  On the Nexus Star, however, you can't do this.  Instead, you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination.  In this case, the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse, and I find it can lead to errors, especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike.  If you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings, this isn't a problem.

I can recommend this compass for use with a GPS receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings, and it is suitable as a back-up compass.  I also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my GPS classes how to use a compass, but I wouldn't recommend it for serious work.",2.0
"My son played with it for a little while, but when put together, it's quite flimsey. When stored, it usually falls apart so he has to put it together every time he wants to play football. Sometimes not worth it to him, so it spends more time in the garage in my way than anything.",2.0
"I have now bought 3 of these bells.  Daughter learning to ride bike and drops it sometimes still.  The bell bursts into pieces after hard fall.  Unless your kid is very careful on setting bike up on kick stand, etc, you will likely see breakage in a short while (whole housing comes apart).",2.0
"While this bicycle bell brings a lot of smiles from the looks of it, it quickly turns the smiles upside down once you start ringing the bell.  We bought this for our daughter's bike, but it broke the same day.  While you can probably get away with glue and tape to help, it's only a temporary solution.

I would recommend spending a few dollars more for a higher quality bicycle bell.  I felt terrible when my daughter came to me with a broken bell and I would hate for anyone else to have to go through that.",2.0
"I bought 2 of these despite the reviews that said it broke easily. One bell broke the first day. It was easy enough to put back together. They have broke several times since then and I have been able to fix them every time, until the most recent one.  Now the bell won't work.  These are very cute but poor in quality.  I would not recommend this bell and wish I would have found something else.",2.0

Secondly, (2) the size of 28.5 inches in circumference, which I understand is advertised, but the word 'official' is confusing without specifying official 'for children / WNBA)'.

On the plus it still beats any other ball while playing at night since it is white.",2.0

The foot pedals disappear and my sons feet drag and go under if parents don't notice right away which is painful. The handle for parents doesn't stay in place which is a pain. And it is almost impossible for parents to turn when they are dealing with kids who still can't steer or pedal yet. My husband and I took our son outside with it once and never again. It isn't safe since it is such a struggle for parents to turn we have to practically drag it from left to right and since it doesn't have a seat belt my son almost fell off the side. He only uses it to rock on at home and will not be using it outside until he can pedal and steer on his own.,2.0
"Toboggans are fun and the positive is that you can ride a whole bunch of kids at one time.  Its better in packed powder and somewhat steerable - you will need to use arms or legs in the snow to get the best control.  On icy hard pack conditions this can be very hard to control.
My biggest negative is the build quality.  The varnish/stain is cheaply done and inconsistent in application as well as did not seem to be very thick - came off after a few runs.  The very thin nylon rope broke 3 times and we kept having to double knot it over and over.  The chain that holds the curved part of the wood and provides tension is attached with this circle ring.  The circle ring is not completely closed so the rope would slide through and we even had the chain come off.  The absolute worst part is that the boards seem very thin.  So thin in fact that we actually cracked two boards on some gentle riding with the family!!!  As a kid I remember punishing our toboggan but never saw it break.  This was a surprise and a big negative after only a few weeks of use.  Looking at the bottom of the sled, nearly all of the varnish is now gone and it now needs a good wax before sledding to reduce the drag.  Overall while the price is tempting I would steer towards one of the mountain boy sleds.",2.0
My son liked that it glows in the dark but it busted the seams open after kicking it a few times. More of a shelf ball. Not for playing with it.,2.0

"I was really excited to give this to my 6-year old as a stocking stuffer for Christmas! Unfortunately this ""dazzler ribbon"" is super dull and unimpressive. First off, it's so curly from being rolled up and packaged, that you can't do anything with it until you iron the ribbon. Even after a good ironing, the ribbon is too short to really impress anyone. Maybe this would be fun for a 2-year old, but even than, I would just go with a dollar store flag and I think that would be more fun that this ""dazzler"" ribbon.",2.0

The stick is way too short for dancing and it's hard to hold. It flies right out of your hand. It's not like the one that I had as a child.,2.0
Way too long for my 3-yr old so I cut the end off. And then the top unraveled off the stick. Worth spending a little more $$ if you're child truly enjoys using it for her 'dance' routines.,2.0
A bit unsafe for running around with.,2.0
This ribbon did not fly well and it is too short to do more than 2-3 loops at once. The quality of this ribbon disappointed me for the price. The stick is also small. I wish I had known before I opened it because now I can't return it. :(,2.0
The handle lasted about three months before it broke.  The air bubbles inside the handle look nice but significantly weaken it. I ended up making a new handle out of a dowel rod.,2.0
Very cheap quality. Won't last long. Expected more for the price.  Shipping was fast.  My granddaughter liked it.  Will go with a real professional one next time.,2.0
"This is a small ribbon, basically it's a toy more than a functional ribbon for dance.  The stick is about 12 inches long.  The ribbon is just over an inch wide and just over 83 inches long.

I was disappointed with this tent. I expected something better made for the money it cost.  Would not recommend.,2.0
This tent is very cute and well made but we actually had to send it back. The sheet part that goes around the mattress is made out of a very slippery and noisy fabric and I knew it would be cold and keep my kids awake or wake them up at night.,2.0

"I don't know if this is an older model that needs redesigning or they just didn't think about things when they were making it.  Yes, it is more durable than the Disney tents, but...the tent is attached to a vinyl ""sheet"" that is supposed to fit on the bed.  Per the instructions, the sheet is washable but the tent is not. Since the tent is sewn to the sheet, I don't know how you would wash the sheet without washing the tent.  If you try to put a sheet on top of the vinyl sheet it just slides off.  And if you are buying because of the zipper in the picture or described in the company web site, be aware that it is not there,  There is only velcro instead.  The velcro isn't a problem for me, but I believe in truth in advertising.  Unfortunately my 5 year old has seen the tent and wants to keep it so we are going to try to make it work, but for the amount that this thing cost, there should be a way to use your own sheets, or at the very least, wash the bottom sheet that comes with it.",2.0
"The image is intentionally misleading. It appears as though 3 of the items come in one package.

"I live on the east coast of Florida. There are only 2 months of the year when there is no breeze going; July and August. Who wants to go outside then? It's really hot in Florida those months.

I experimented with this thing for over 2 hours with my right hand and an hour with my left.  To be clear, today and yesterday, the wind was under 5 mph.

First, the left. I'm left handed. I tried throwing at the angle described on the package. I can only get it to attempt to come back to me if I throws it at just the right angle in the wind. Most of the time, it just takes a nose dive about the time it started to turn back. The only way I could come close to getting it work left handed was to angle my spine as far as possible to the right and throw with the boomerang at the 30 degree angle to my spine. Not comfortable at all and not easy.

I experimented a lot longer from the right side. Throwing with my right hand is not natural, but I can do it. softballs, footballs, frisbees, whatever. This. Not so much. I got a few good results with the following: release the boomerang a lot sooner than you would any other throwing item (ball, frisbee). It really feels like I might drop it. I also can't let my elbow move too far from my body. Very unnatural and not like any other throwing object. Don't try to throw it hard. The docs talk about trying to hit the ground 100 feet away. Right. I have to give it a throw that might send it 50 feet. The harder I threw it, the less it worked. I tried all kinds of angles. The 30 degree angle from the top angle simply doesn't work in a slight breeze. You absolutely must throw it into the breeze or just slightly at an angle to it. It doesn't work at all with the breeze. Yes, I played with bending the tips as instructed too. I could definitely see flight pattern changes, but nothing that made it work in the breeze.

My son had slightly better results than I did, but not much.

I did spend some time surfing the web to find videos and suggestions. There aren't a lot of suggestions out there. All the videos are in dead calm conditions. Not helpful to me.

I won't quit on this thing yet, and I will update with better results if I get any or if I manage to find a completely breezeless day. I really want this to work. But so far, I'm not impressed.",2.0

"Product showed up on time and packaging was good, no problems with that.  What I am disappointed with, the one I received has a loose bevel.  Any time I try to set an azimuth the bevel moves a good 16th of an inch or little better in the direction of the force applied.  Honestly, after all the reading I did on Suunto and the quality they are known for...I did expect a little better.  Over all it looks nice and has some nice options, I really like the magnifying lenses and the see-through base.  To tell you the truth I will end up not using it on the trail or in the brush.  I will stick with my good old Army compass and use the Suunto to check my north azimuth from time to time.  If your busting brush, I just can't trust this device.  I don't think it would throw me off that much, but I would have to check my heading twice as much.  I think the every day hiker on the trail, for the price this is probably a very good buy out of the box.  I may be a little too critical of my land navigation, but it is...what it is.",2.0
"Not too happy with this. Difficult to read, annoying to need a tool to adjust declination and the plastic cover doesn't seem like the latch will hold up. It just seems way too fragile. The rear sight is difficult to see and line up with the mirrored sight.

"I write this review as at encouragement from a Dip N Dive E-mail.  The company did an excellent job of packaging and getting the compass to me.
The problem I have is basically the same as other reviewers. Its mechanical alignment and assembly.
It was purchased to back up my GPS receiver.  I have a basic Silva but wanted something better.
Now I am left with the decision of either keeping it or returning it.  As it is, its not worth the extra weight to carry.
Suunto has an excellent reputation and it is possible this is a bad batch.  After reading the result of another customers effort to exchange for a different one which came w/ the same problem - guess I'll go through the process of return and forget about exchanging.  Perhaps I'll pick up a Silva Ranger or simply use the basic units I have.
Bottom line - I can not recommend this compass.",2.0
"This really is the best mirror sighting compass out there.  It is very accurate.  I have been using it for search and rescue.  So why only three stars?  First off my mirror started to corrode under the glass.  It did not have any chemical or anything like that spilled on it.

The other big issue that kind of made me mad is the model shown in the picture is the metric model I needed.  However what was shipped was the US version in miles.  I did not feel like sending it back for just that but every time I look at it I get angry that I did not get what I ordered.",2.0

The tool supplied to adust for magnetic declination is also of poor quality and I found it better to purchase a quality instrument from the hardware store.",2.0
"I did not purchase this item, nor am I saying anything about the compass part. It is the scale etched into the plastic that made me reject the Suunto compass. If you zoom in on the image you will find a 1 : 25000 scale. However, most USGS topo maps are 1 : 24000 scale. I want to avoid taking a grid reader with me when I go hiking (always take a topo map). A compass with a 24K scale on it would do nicely, but not this compass.",2.0
"I hate having to do reviews like this, but when a manufacturer earns it, well...

Several weeks ago I ordered the Suunto MC-2DLIN from Amazon (great service as always) for evaluation.  I own a number of Suunto compasses and have used them in some pretty harsh environments (Middle East) and I've always been impressed with the quality of the company's products.  Suunto is the ONLY brand of compass I've owned where the needle capsule did not develop air bubbles.  I can't say the same for some other well known brands, particularly Silva and Brunton.

A relative told me he was interested in buying this compass for his son for use in Boy Scouts and asked my opinion.  I told him I'd buy one and check it out.

Overall the compass is a well made example of a classic design and first impressions are very good.  However, on close examination of the compass needle capsule it is clear that the alignment arrow in the base of the compass capsule and the parallel alignment marks/declination scale indicator are slightly offset.  This indicates that the two scales are not concentric.  To get them properly aligned you must set the declination scale at approximately 2 degrees east declination.  This means that the compass capsule (which carries the needle and alignment arrow) is not set on the same center as the movable declination scale!

This offset is easy to see if you place the compass on a piece of graph paper to check the alignment of all the scales.

This amount of built-in error is simply too much for an instrument that is supposed to 'replace luck'.

I figured that my compass was just a single example of something that slipped through the QC checks at Suunto, so I arranged with Amazon for a replacement.  When the replacement compass arrived I was very disappointed to see that this compass also has the same issue.  I can only conclude that this 'error' is built into the Suunto manufacturing process and that Suunto is shipping thousands of MC-2 compasses around the world with an extra 2 degrees of error built in.

I have decided to keep this compass as an example to my students as to why you should always check your compasses at a known azimuth station (check with your county surveyor to see if there are any azimuth stations in your area).  The good news is that the adjustable declination scale allows you to adjust out this error.

Sorry Suunto, but I simply can not recommend the MC-2D compass until you clean up your manufacturing and/or QC issues.",2.0

not very rugged. first one broke within 10 slugs being fired and bushnell took over 3 months to send a replacement! my other bushnell scope (3-9x) has been great tho!,2.0
"I bought this Bushnell Banner 3-9x40mm as an upgrade to replace a 32mm Barska Plinker for my 10/22 rifle.
It had been specifically recommended over the Barska but boy was I disappointed!

It has a very bad fishbowl effect around the edge of the lens. All scopes have some. This one has a lot!
I wouldn't use it for anything other than shooting paper with a .22LR because the distortion is so bad.

The magnification is wrong. On 3x it magnifies equivalent to 4x on all my other scopes.
If I had wanted 4x minimum I would have ordered 4x minimum!

The image is very clear, but only in the center, and not noticeably better or worse than any other 40mm scope I have.
It's not a bad scope. It's just that it gets beat by scopes at half the price...

I'm really just upset that I spent $75 on this Bushnell to replace my $30 Barksa and the Barska seems better to me.

My advice: stick to scopes either over $300 or less than $50 'cause you won't get better untill you hit the $300 mark...",2.0
"I have used several different scopes over my many years of hunting and shooting. I have other Tasco scopes and are somewhat pleased with them.  However, this scope IS NOT the of quolity  I expected. The adjustment towers are not centered or straight in the housing and they are NOT crisp.  I didn't expect the optics to be crystal clear at 40 power, but it is well below what I feel  is good.  I would reccomend to buy a different brand in the same power settings even if they cost more.",2.0

"The target is badly out-of-focus at shorter distances (25 yards or less).  Bringing the target into focus badly blurs the cross-hair reticle, ruining the sight picture.

"I loved this scope on my 10/22 .22lr, that was until I dropped the rifle, scope downward. The short fall must have caused the scope to fail. For a short term solution its a great scope, but the left/right adjustment was non existent afterwords, so sadly my review went from amazing to well not so amazing as a long term solution. It will get you on target with consistent accuracy, just ensure you don't drop it. Prior to the damage I did love this scope for its great optics and cheap price.",2.0
Well lets be honest its a $50 scope. The optics are fair at best but easy to operate and easily zeroed in. Unlike others who complained about the finish mine is fine and holding up well. Its a good $50 scope. Its not a nikon like on my other gun but it didn't cost as much either.,2.0
"I really wanted it to work on my 10/22 breakdown, but gave up after getting it sighted in at 6x, then going to 3x or 9x.  It would not hold zero.  3x went to lower left quadrant, 9x to upper right quadrant.  Several tests convinced me I had a defective scope.  Tired of messing with lower priced variable zoom scopes, purchased a Nikon rimfire 4x- no issues.  Decided I did not need 9x on a .22 rifle.  FWIW: I do not have this problem on my large caliber Nikon variable zoom scopes.",2.0
"You get what you pay for.  This is a cheap scope with poor optics.  I will not return this as I got what I asked for but it will either sit on my shelf or get tossed as it is not even worth the hassle of returning.  Do not buy this scope if you are familiar with Leupold, Nikon scopes.",2.0
"I currently own one of these.  I have it on top of a Remington 700 in .308.  The rifle, scope, rings, and mount were all brand new.  I took the setup to the range once in a new hard case (read I didn't abuse it).  I put about 75 rounds through it,  cleaned it and put away for the winter.  When I took the rifle out to clean it,  I found the rear lens of the scope was loose.  I am not sure what happened,  but now I gotta to have it shipped in for warrenty working.

I should have known it was going to give me trouble.

The scope held zero the whole time at the range and I had no troubles zeroing, which is why I gave witt two stars instead of only one.",2.0
"I would not recommend this product.  It maybe cheap however, you will be happier spending some more money and getting a more compact scope.  This is a good telescope for putting out on your deck.  It's way too big and clumsy for range useage.",2.0

Its such a nice scope, but not shock proof? thanks amazon..",2.0
"Going through Amazon as usual is a pleasure . Your service is the best . The scope  I'm not pleased with . When you look through it the pitcher is large , bright and crisp until you move your sight plane up down or to the side , then the outside third of the pitcher gets distorted . should of went with my second choice - Redfield 2 x 7 x32 .",2.0
"There are better scopes out there for the money and I think the Tasco World Class series are one of Tasco's best if your going to go with Tasco.  What I disliked about this scope was it started getting noticeably dark around 10 power.  It never seemed clear either.  Also the eye piece focus adjustment was stupid to say the least. Seemed like I turned the adjustment ring around and around and never could decide which position had the best focus for my eyes. Then once you find the best focus you have to tighten up the lock ring to hold it there.  What a dumb idea!  The Nikon Prostaff series scopes which have a simular adjustment are easy to find the precise focus without the miserable locking nut.  Don't waste your time with this scope.  The crosshairs on this scope seemed larger than than they need to be.

If you think you need to have 24 power, then move up to the Bushnell Elite series or equvalent at around $700+. Good optics are are so important and most people elect to go cheap on scopes and rings after putting a lot of money out for a quality rifle.  For shooting 50-200 yards, consider a Nikon Prostaff Target EFR 3-9x40 AO Matte Precision Reticle, at twice the price of the Tasco and be happy once and for all.",2.0

"Similar to other reviews, unit is all plastic.  Mine did not come with the stated pads, and their was only one mounting plate for the back to secure the rim.

It turned into a expensive decoration with no function.",2.0
Ridiculously lightweight. Sounds like it will break every time the hits the backboard. Would not recommend this product it is not made of quality materials.,2.0
"This backboard feels flimsy.  It looks ok, appears to be well-made, etc; it just has a lot of flex to it.

As a result, when the B-ball hits the backboard, the backboard flexes and this results in an unpredictable rebound.

I mounted it to a brick wall using Lifetime's universal mounting kit and 5/16"" Red-Head masonry anchor bolts.  It's not the mount that's the problem, it's the back-board itself.

Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible product for the money.  But if you can afford something better, and basketball really matters to you, you can do better.",2.0

This is an update: looking closer at it, including the packaging which was a simple plastic bag with no brand name and it came with no information or instructions (as shown in the original site) I'm guessing this band is a knock-off.  The handle doesn't look right either. Our gym has many SPRI bands and none have tubes as thin and flimsy as what I got.",2.0

very hard on my knees,2.0
"I have the red bands and use it for P90X but these bands I really didn't like for a number of reasons. I'll explain: if you're doing repetitive motions day and day out you need quality equipment and the RED bands were great, but I bought a heavier BLUE AND PURPLE and the bands didn't work as well.

Here's why:
 The handles were off balanced. The strap to the handle - one side was shorter than the other on both handles. This caused your hands to shift to an awkward angle - like 15 degrees. Long term repetitive motion with biceps curls will tweak your wrists.

 This was a major design oversight: The straps to the handle should have been longer, or covered with a tape because as you do curls, it rubs against your arm repeatedly - eventually causing abrasions. The RED band had a longer strap so when you used it it didn't touch your arm or wrist. I'm on the shorter side, but if you're a big person this will rub over and over against your skin.

I've been faithfully working out now for 15 years and as much as I want to love these bands, I think SPRI made a mistake on the design of this.

* it claims to offer resistance for the ""fit"" to ""very fit"" range. I can do 20lb bicep curls, 10 rep max. This band lets me do curls forever. If I make a loop, things improve but:
* if you use loops or shorter sections of the band, it's hard to keep track of how much you ""lifted"". With dumbbells, it's clear and you can track your progress.
* the handles are not cushioned or rubberized. They're simple plastic and tend to rub against my palm.
* the handles are not extensible with additional tubes. Compare that to Lifelineusa bands, where you can put up to three bands on the handle and greatly vary the resistance.
* as another reviewer mentioned, bands don't really work for muscle gain. They work for strength and toning.

Pros:
* much cheaper than dumbbels, and easy to carry around.",2.0

1. I bought 5 of the navy blue in Medium since I fell in love with the first one I ordered through Prime Now. I ordered a black one size medium and it fits my 130 lbs 5'3 37 year old body. Therefore, based on the color you choose, sizes will vary also.

2. The quality of the navy blue is too thin as compared to the black one (may be that's the reason why there's a huge price difference between the 2 colors).

"I originally ordered myself a small and my friend a medium.  I was swimming in the small and I am 5'4"" at 115lbs.  I had to order an extra small.  My friend who has much more of a booty than I typically wears a medium but she took my small instead.",2.0
I bought a previous pair of the same brand at the local store and liked them. This pair said it was the same size but ran too big when it arrived.,2.0
"Wow, measured according to size chart on item page and the shorts are about 4 sizes too big.",2.0

"The fabric of the shorts is a 50-50 blend of cotton and polyester and has a nice finish.  In the picture the shorts appeared to have a white accent waist band, but upon receipt, I realized it is simply the elastic waist band turned down [confusing].  Also, the elastic is not encased in the fabric on the inside next to your skin.  After some wear in the heat it became quite uncomfortable an irritated my skin.",2.0
Sizing is true to junior sizing. Medium fit like an adult XS or S. Please note that the garter is exposed on the inside of the shorts and not covered with fabric. Some might find this irritating on the skin.,2.0

"I used it once but never again.  It pulled up under my arms and did not hold me up in the water, I am 155 pounds.",2.0
Tried one on but did not fit well.  The elastic at the bottom caused them to ride up high every time I reached or made any movement.  Did not seem like an adult size even though it said it was.,2.0
"Belt itself is a great product; however, it came to me with a 6"" deep gash probably made by a razorblade. When I saddle soaped it to soften it, the gashed portion near the bottom back felt like I could rip it off with my
hands. When it dried, it wasn't as bad so I kept it. I bought it for those times my back goes out, but if I used it often going to gym, I would have returned it.
My take? Quality control
not there. They never should have shipped it.",2.0
"The unfortunate problem is that the padding for this product is poorly glued, and so eventually that glue gives out, leaving you with inversion boots that don't work and need to be fixed.

Don't waste your money on this product. I now wish I had gone a different route, but I thought I was getting a good deal paying only $50 some bucks for a pair of inversion boots... I was wrong.

Make your money count, and get the high-end model!",2.0
Inversion table is a better investment.,2.0
"One clip was broken when I received these, never have used them.",2.0
"They hurt like hell, even with as much padding as I could add in there they dig into your ankles/top of your feet...and I am not that heavy and not overweight, I can only imagine how much more pressure would be there on someone larger than myself.  Really though, look at that metal edge (i thought the padding would be enough but there isn't any on top of that edge) and now imagine your whole body weight pushing that edge into the top of your foot/bottom of your ankle...sound like fun?  Not to mention how difficult it is to get these onto and then off the bar without killing yourself...and again I am thin and also rather nimble, not out of shape, so if you are, don't even think about these.  I sold mine a couple months after buying them because I couldn't convince myself to use them...when I did I could stand the pain for no more than a few minutes.  These are much nicer quality than others I've seen and seemed really durable but who gives a crap if you can't even use them.  Spend a little extra money (and yes sacrifice the extra space) and get an inversion table which till take a lot of the pressure off your ankles/top of your feet and you won't risk breaking your neck trying to use it.",2.0
Came unhooked big concern for me.,2.0
"Too big and there's no different size available. I am 5'10"" 185 lb man but it does not fit me at all. I am curious how some other people smaller than me can use this.  I felt like my feet sliding out from the boots when I use them. I am returning them and get other ones with adjustment.",2.0
Bought these some time ago just to try them out. But they're not for Me . I really didn't feel secure enough to just hang there.,2.0
"i have scoliosis so i thought i would get into the whole inversion thing, but this thing has me thinking about getting a inversion table. for one unless your crazy fit, or like me an average dude you will not be able to get yourself hooked up without assistance, by the way make sure you don't end up kicking your helper in the head with these things cause they hurt!!!!!!  so as i was hanging upside down i began to immediately feel the euphoria and decompression in my spine, really.  but the pain at my ankles also began to set in almost immediately. it literally felt as if my legs were going to rip at the ankles.

ive read in order to have a good therapeutic inversion session you need to be hanging at least ten minutes, i only lasted about three, and then had to be immediately helped of, because as i said i could not at all unhook myself.  but to be honest the relief i felt made me think maybe it just takes some getting used to, so i guess ill hang in there hahahahahahahah",2.0
"I bought these to relieve pressure in some disks in my back as a result of my scoliosis.
I was excited to get these, but ended up a disappointed.
Because they are made out of metal, they do not give. What this means is that the edge puts a lot of pressure on the top part of your foot/ankle as you invert.
To keep you foot from hurting too much you have to flex your foot, which is counterintuitive to inversion therapy. To properly relieve tension in your back your whole body needs to be relaxed and that is hard to do with these boots.
Also, unless you are in a college dorm like I am and are limited by space, get an inversion table. I have one at home and I miss it quite a bit. If you are looking for inversion boots, look elsewhere.
These are quality made and designed boots, but they are just too damn uncomfortable.",2.0
"I bought these hoping to be able to invert using me my pull up bar as a way to relieve stress.  After putting them on, they felt very loose even with the foam pad installed that they provide.  While hanging upside down, the pressure of my body pulling on my ankles caused blood circulation problems in my foot which I couldn't figure out a way around.  I even wrapped t-shirts around my ankles so the boots would fit more securely but that didn't work as well.  Maybe you will have better luck then I did if you decide to purchase these.",2.0

"I purchased these fins four months ago and based my purchase on the reviews for this product.  I have used them with my float tube on five separate fishing trips.  My first trip they seemed to work fairly well, but on subsequent trips became increasingly disappointing.  The strap releases, which are typical cheap plastic clip types, began to release while in use.  The first time it happened I nearly lost the fin (they don't float of course) and I was fortunate enough to catch it before it sake to the bottom of the lake.  Last week (my fifth and last trip with these fins) They released five times because the rubber (flubber) straps kept come out of the plastic clips.  Being constantly concerned about whether or not you fins are going to come off is no fun. At the end of the day while I was return from the far side of the lake I felt a strap let go and rather they try to reattach it (again!) I limped to shore with one fin. As I pressed the releases on the remaining fin one of them broke.  These fins are poorly designed for float tube fishing.  The rubber stretches with use until they become useless and the plastic clip attachments are easy to clip on but are not strong enough to last beyond a few uses.  These may be adequate for scuba diving, but they DO NOT serve the float tube fisher.  If I could return them now I would.  Unfortunately the return period often doesn't provide for actual use of a product and customer dissatisfaction.  Don't waste your money or precious fishing time on this disappointing product.",2.0
"fins work ok, but tend to slip off as the buckle seems cheaply made. I have to put them on super tight (which is a bit uncomfortable during long periods of fishing) because if I don't then loosen up and fall off. And when they do, they sink.
I would recommend a pro quality body-boarding fin instead. Ridley makes fine ones.",2.0
"With the thin straps I should have realized that this thing would slide all over my head.  The gear protected my ears, but keeping it in place was distracting.",2.0

I was very disappointed to find out that pflueger with their years of experience and reputation for making fly reels would turn out a reel that is such a piece of junk.

"Bought one from a Walmart supercenter not Amazon. The shad lure I normally use has to be ordered from Northman tackle and didn't have time for it to ship. Didn't notice any breakage but same day I bought it and after first catch had a smooth break along the flat sides. little balls popped out some big mostly small. Can't return no receipt. Emailed customer service about warranty no response. Posted video on YouTube and trashed lure that's my response. I would never buy again. Haven't seen such a fragile lure. Gave it 2 stars because it caught the fish before breaking granted senkos, top floaters and an MTB box wasn't catching anything in the lake I was fishing.",2.0
"So here is my story.  I bought this after doing some research and reading reviews where ever I could find them, the TRU Ball name carried a lot of weight as well.  The fit and finish of this release are very good, no complaints there.  My issue comes from a premature fire incident that warped a cam on my brand new Bow Tech Assassin.  The configuration of the hinged release lever makes it possible to fire the unit without the use of your thumb.  In mid draw, the meaty part of my hand at the base of the index finger came in contact with the exposed lever and off she went.  It probably didn't help that the sensitivity setting of the release was pretty light, at any rate, when the bow fired it tried to spin out of my hand.  My right hand went flying backwards and the release itself launched into outer space and bounced off a concrete wall.  The body of the release itself was damaged and release lever was thoroughly bent against the housing and is immovable.

I had to smile when reviewing a prophetic warranty blurb that came in the package.  Within the text, in BOLD print, it says, ""LETTING GO OF YOUR RELEASE AID AT ANY TIME DURING THE SHOT PROCESS, AS EVIDENCED BY ABNORMAL DENTS AND/OR BENT PARTS, WILL VOID THIS WARRANTY.""  Hmmm... I thought, seems like TRU Ball has experience with flying releases.

In the final analysis this release might be just what the doctor ordered for you, but beware you meat fisted archers, it can be easily triggered by parts of the hand's anatomy other that the intended thumb.  65 dollar make you holler Joe.  I haven't gotten the Assassin repair bill yet.  Talk about holler!  I'm now the proud owner of a TRU Ball Ultra Xtreme Talon 4 Finger.  Caveat Emptor.",2.0
"I normally shoot with a wrist release, but I decided to give the T-handle a try, if you do try one make sure it is not this one.  The ammount of pressure you have to apply to the ""trigger"" is more than I would like, it is also not a quick release you have to depress the trigger in order to open the jaws.  overall if you are using a bow with suction cups on it i might use this but still it would be a tossup between my fingers and this",2.0

"This tee is not made of durable material.  The only flexible rubber part is the top part that the ball sits on, and even that part is not a sturdy rubber like I'm used to with quality batting tees.  The rest of the tee seems like it would break relatively easily if struck.  Luckily, my toddlers will be swinging a plastic bat.  My shipment was delayed and I had to initiate contact with Team Express three weeks after my order was placed to find out what was going.  They were quick to respond, and nine days later (today) I got a tee (although it is not the tee I ordered).  The tee they sent me may have been an ""alleged"" step up from this tee, but it has some sort of a swivel head on the top that broke while assembling it.  I just bypassed the swivel and assembled the tee to look similar to what you see for this product.  The price was right (we got it for $20 including shipping), Christmas is right around the corner, and I'm not willing to deal with a return.  So, we're not trying to return it.  But, I do know to spend the money on a legitimate tee when my kids get a little bit bigger (or swing a metal bat).",2.0

"I purchased this at the end of last hunting season to try to get a little more action.  I played with it inside trying to get comfortable with using both the chatter call and the distress call.  I finally brought it out into to the woods to try to use it and had no real luck.

Now for those unfamiliar with squirrel calls, they do not attract squirrels, but instead encourage squirrels to show themselves by moving from their hiding places.  I may have not had squirrels around me to alert or I may just need more practice!

Sadly I was never able to perfect my skills because I found the next time I tried to use it that the metal reed had fallen out making the chatter call silent.  I called HS and they said they would take a look at it but I need to pay to ship it there.  I realize this is generally standard practice, but for such a small cheap device I find it not worth sending in.  I will try to use just the distress call for now but I do not plan on buying another squirrel call from HS again.",2.0

Shipping - even though all three were ordered at the same time they showed in 2 packages, not big deal except for one was in a padded envelope and looked like it had been run over by the delivery truck (I understand that may not be Amazon's fault).

I mean it's a fishing pole but it's so stiff you can't get any wip when you cast. I ended up returning and getting the ugly stick rod.,2.0

I expected something with lighter action. This rod feels like piece of wood,2.0
"Great fishing pole!!however if your order is linked to Warehouse Deals in Hebron Kentucky...my advise:arrange the followup order and shipping yourself?""I continue to use the 10' section even though it looks and works like a getto pole without the reel seat section!!!",2.0
"I recently bought two 10' Tundra combos. One has turned out to be OK so far after three 7-hour or so pier fishing sessions.

The other's largest guide insert shattered within a few hours of the first trip's start. I sent that back for an exchange.  The replacement rod's reel seat was missing large chunks of plastic, which I found in the bottom of the box, and have super glued back in place (not going to bother with a second return).  Given how unbelievably cheap these combos are (about $38 shipped for the 10'), I'm not surprised they're not durable.  I just didn't expect them to be this flimsy.

Surprisingly, the tops and bottoms of the pole are not interchangeable between the two poles. One didn't fit the other at all.  I put a little nail polish to distinguish between them, problem solved.  Also what other folks are saying about needing a light (very light) sanding and some lube between the pieces is spot on.

And yes, they are quite heavy in use. On the pier where we fish, overhead/ sidearm casting is not allowed; underhand casting this thing for 7 hours will give your forearms one heck of a workout.

I was considering getting the 13 for surfcasting, but after seeing what other folks are saying about the weight just going up, I'm going to find something else...",2.0
"This was my first saltwater rod and I followed the amazon reviews to buy this one.  I did not follow the advice to sand the contacts and my pole was stuck together for quite some time which was annoying.  Additionally, after maybe 5-8 fishing trips to the beach, one of the rings on my rod snapped off.  I have had many freshwater poles growing up and they all last years.  I was quite disappointed to have this pole break after so few fishing trips.",2.0
"Got the 15 Foot Rod.

I'm a novice fisherman but did some homework before I hit the beach to go fishing. I Had an 8 foot rod (Ugly Stick) for the pier and saw videos about pendulum casting so thought I might as well get a long casting rod to get some distance off the beach. I tried this rod out. I found it very (too) heavy as far as fishing rods go. I thought that going to the gym would enable me to handle most fishing rods but didn't work for this one. I could physically cast, but could not generate enough force to get an off the ground cast to go more than 20 yards. I could not get a bending/whipping action going with the weight, using a 6oz. Perhaps if I used 8 or more, could have done it.

With nothing attached to this rod, it feels like i'm swinging a Claymore/Flamberge/Gattsu's Dragon Slayer. This isn't something one would want to deal with for a day long fishing trip. I think this rod would be better for hanging off the end of a boat as it is very sturdy.

Gave 2 stars because there is no way i'm going to ever handle this rod. I would have to hit the gym 24 hours a day to have the raw strength to whip this 300 yards, much less 50. I gave up after 5 casts. My wrists were about to come off just standing there holding it. If steroids existed that only affect forearms, would shoot them directly into my forearms at 3 times the suggested dose and give this rod another shot.

Since I'm a novice I don't really know if ALL 15 footers are like this, so please take this review with a grain of salt. I assume there has to exist a 15 foot rod made of graphite that is way easier to handle. I could be wrong. If tomorrow I figured out the right combination to get great casts out of this, will rewrite review and give 5 stars :)

All that aside, everything else about it was great! Overall look is really nice, has a bottom guide that folds down for storage. Metal reel holders. Very nice craftsmanship. Would have given 5 stars if weight wasn't a problem.

Don't listen to this review if you are a super bad-ass/strong dude.
Would recommend this rod to you if you are:
The Incredible Hulk, Gohan SSJ2, Gattsu (Post-Eclipse), Superman, suddenly transported back in time into a medieval joust.",2.0
"... it's like casting a telephone pole. I bought the 15-foot version for a specialized kind of snook fishing at a local pier where you stick the rod tip down in the water and do this fast circular or figure-8 pattern with a red-head Bomber lure 3 or 4 feet out from the tip, but quickly became disenchanted with that because it's not what I consider real fishing. Real fishing is ... well, up to your own interpretation. So I took this rod to the beach and tried to use it there in the surf. Although I got some decent casts (almost falling into the surf in the process), it's LIKE CASTING A TELEPHONE POLE. I wish I'd bought the 10' version instead. Amazon's delivery was pretty good with the free shipping, but the rod had a couple of dings in it that I felt compelled to fill with epoxy.",2.0
The pole was too heavy so ended up not using it.  I sold it during a yard sale for half the price I bought for.  Ended up buying a better pole for $100 at a sportsmens.  I guess you get what you pay for.,2.0
Larger than expected. Looks cheap too. Disappointing!,2.0
"This item may be a fantastic discus carrier, but it is NOT designed to hold a shot put of any size. The picture is very misleading. It is designed with two distinct discus shaped and sized pockets.

We ordered this ""shot put"" carrier as a Christmas gift... and it wasn't taken out of the plastic until it was opened as a gift... and it was clearly not what we thought it would be. We returned it.

The drag adjustment wheel wouldn't stay where I set it.  The drag was too light even when set at the highest level. I contacted an authorized Daiwa service center and I was told that there must be a stripped part.  I also had intermittant reeling problems like something was interfering with the gears.  I ended up returning this reel to Amazon for a refund.  I was very disappointed with the reel considering the majority of reviewers had good things to report about it with the exception of the adjustment wheel issue.  This was my first and last purchase of a Daiwa reel and will try Abu-Garcia reels next time.,2.0

"I have tried using this for SEVERAL practices. I have read the pamphlet and even watched videos on how to use it (the videos make it look very easy).  But for distance, I am having a hard time getting the ball just a few feet into the outfield.

I don't know if it's me...or if the accubat needs a real good breaking in. Had a crazy thought to take it to the batting cages.",2.0
"At an out of town softball tournament, a coach from another team showed me this, and said they used it in practice.  He was packing the trunk up, and did it was not a convenient location to demonstrate the product.  I snapped a picture with my phone, and came home and ordered one.

Conspicuously, there are no videos online of these being used with softballs - maybe it is only useful for baseballs.  I brought it to my daughter's softball practice, and tried to hit a few fly balls, thinking it would be nice for outfield practice.  What I found was the sweet spot is small, compared to a 12"" softball.  I hit the frame a lot, or near enough to the edge that it did not launch the ball deep.  A dozen balls and I had pain in my elbow, like if I did this 100 times I'd get tendonitis.  That defeats the whole point, as I was hoping for something to avoid next day soreness from throwing 100+ fly balls to outfielders.  After that first initial trial, I also found a broken band.  I returned next day for a refund.  Too expensive to hang onto as it didn't work like I hoped.",2.0

I haven't tried it so I can't rate it the way I would like to. My issue is the price. Seems overly priced. So I tried a racquet ball racquet and work just as well with support for every pop of course just like accubat sells replacement netting I found replacing the strings on the racquet not as hard.

2. Small problem: This net says it fits any rim, but it does have one fewer connecting hook than my rim is made for. This is a minor inconvenience, nothing more, but I do find it slightly odd.

Other than that, the net is great. But... PLEASE GIVE ME SOMETHING TO ATTACH IT TO THE RIM.",2.0

"These are okay.  I bought two of these for a local outdoor court.  Installation was relatively easy, you will need pliers as mentioned by other reviewers.

The reason for the 2 stars is because of false advertising.  THESE WILL RUST and pretty quickly.

I specifically bought these because the advertising said that it is galvanized and enthusiastically stated ""will not rust!""  That is just flat out not true.

They began to rust within the first 60 days.  While they didn't break immediately, it has now been about 9 months and one of the nets is completely in tatters, just random chains hanging there.  The other one is still mainly intact but has broken in 2 spots and is in the process of coming undone.  In other words, they both already need to be replaced.

For the price, they are okay but kinda defeats the purpose of buying a chain net.

This time around i will be looking for higher quality.",2.0

"At first, I thought this was going to be a great metal net. After I opened it and brought it out the the hoop I quickly found out that the hooks didn't sit the way they should of, so the hooks that attach to the rim kept falling off. I then tie wrapped them to the rim and that solved that issue, but then the side links of the net started to separate and fall apart. It seem so far I have been up and down the ladder trying to modify it to stay intact, more than I have been playing ball!",2.0

"I bought this to holster a Glock 17. The holster itself is light, has good belt-loops and an arched shape so that it aligns very well and comfortably to the shape of your hip. However, once you pop your Glock 17 down into the holster, the pistol won't come out of the holster again without you using your other hand to restrain it while pulling the pistol out. If you don't use your other hand to grip the holster you will not ever pull the pistol out, but rather just pull your pants up to the point that you are giving yourself a wedgie. That's how strongly this holster grips the Glock 17.

I'm sure it's possible to stretch or break the holster in somehow even if it's hard and solid plastic, but if Fobus had just put two damned little adjustable screws at the edge instead of two bolts, the problem would be solved. Do not buy this holster.",2.0

If you don't use a hand to hold the holster in place you can give yourself a wedgy trying to withdraw the weapon. It is made out of two pieces of hard plastic and when I put my weapon in, it forces the seams to spread and the quality of the rivets holding it together look like they could break at any time. I normally use a Galco tuckable, but now and then I need/want to carry on the outside, so I got what I paid for.",2.0

No hamfisting required to break the nylon knob loose!  I'm honestly a bit disappointed and would not recommend if you are looking for a durable no worries sling swivel.

Update:  I bumped up one additional star.  I contacted bushnell and their customer service is excellent.  They informed me that the nylon knobs are specifically designed to rotate freely around the pin.  You actually have to pull on the nylon away from the swivel while rotating to get it engage.  They said this feature was to make the pins more secure in that they don't back out by themselves.  He also mentioned that the packaging does not reflect this change.

I'm going to fold and sew the nylon the one going to the barrel so it makes it so the pad will rest on my shoulder. hope this review helps.,2.0
cheap plastic knobs strip very easy,2.0
"Opening the first one was bad enough.  First, spend a few minutes figuring out how the lower part opens so you can fit it on the attachment knob: no simple instruction, no simple picture, nothing, anywhere on the package.  Opening it was very tough but done with a small screwdriver pushing in while I turned the bar out.  Went to the second one using the same method, no go.  No matter how much I pushed and pulled with my fingers while using the screw driver to push in the release, it would not open.

I went to the needle-nosed pliers.  Now, I am not very strong since my arthritis has become so bad.  So, I didn't use a lot of pressure.  But, while using one pair of small pliers to hold the piece, I used another to pull out the ""lock"" and turn it to open the bar so it could be put on my shotgun.  Apparently, my meager pressure was too much for this work of craftsmanship.  The pliers holding the MAIN piece while I pulled on the locking bar bent the arm - that's not supposed to move - back.  Being plastic, that was all she wrote.  The piece was now so weak that just touching it broke it off of the swivel.

This is a piece of junk.  Don't bother with ""Uncle Mike's.""  Look for a different brand with a better mounting system, or buy a metal ones.",2.0
"As others have reported, the knurled cap on the screw-down expander is plastic and gives the swivel a cheap feel.  Also the threads on the screw-down lock seem to disengage before it can be completely tightened and so there is always some play in this mechanism that allows it to open slightly, which leads one to suspect that it might be possible for it to be forced open enough to unlock, which would be undesirable.",2.0

When I took the swivels out of the factory packaging, I noticed that one of the swivels was bent at the swinging point of the swivel so that it made the swivel look cock-eyed when on the gun.  The other swivel had a loose plastic cover on the turning/locking screw and made it difficult to cinch down.  I think Uncle Mike's better start letting some people in the USA start making their stuff again because this was terrible workmanship.  I will probably start buying only Blackhawk products again.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because they did fit on an old shotgun and OpticSale.com did refund my money.",2.0
"This cleaning rod does a good job but as others have noted the red coating can and does rub off. I bought it to clean a 22 carbine and the first time I used it I noticed there were long and deep scratches in the red coating. When I inspected the bore it indeed had several traces of that red coating deposited there. Not a good situation.

The rod portion of this item is flexible almost to the point of being flimsy. The reason for this is that the rod's diameter has to be kept small because it is designated for all calibers from .22 to .45. After seeing the red deposits in the bore of my .22 I chose to buy a Pro-Shot cleaning rod for my Beretta CX4. In my opinion Pro-Shot produces a little better product.

"Last year, I'd have given this product 5 stars happily.  It worked well and left just the right amount of protective coating on the metal.  I used mine religiously, and gave them as small gifts to other students at our swordsmanship school when they bought their first rapier.

Last month, I ordered several to ""restock"" - and all of them were nearly useless, leaving no protective coating at all even after 10+ minutes of vigorous use.  Assuming a shipping defect, I re-ordered this month and sadly discovered the same problem.  The manufacturer has changed this product, it is no longer the excellent thing it used to be.",2.0

"This is a very attractive and solid mat, but very slippery. When my hands and feet got slightly sweaty, I started sliding and couldn't do a simple down-dog. Not very useful or practical for yoga, but maybe useful for other floor exercises?",2.0
Real bummer on this mat because it is very slippery. The thickness and quality otherwise feels great but my yoga class experience was wildly diminished when I couldn't keep my solidly placed because they were sliding in opposite directions on the mat surface. I would not recommend this unless you're planning on using a towel over it (and even then...),2.0
This mat has OK cushioning however it is very slippery. It is so slippery that makes it difficult to focus on the practice since the risk of injury due to slippage is always there.,2.0
Earth/sky color us purple not brown,2.0
Super slippery at first but that's typical of a new yoga mat. Issue is that it's WAY too thin. It says standard thickness but it's basically like being on a piece of cardboard. Will be exchanging hopefully.,2.0
It would have been wiser for me to invest in a more high-quality yoga mat. I practice hot yoga and keep sliding on this one. Plus it smells bad.,2.0
"Honestly, it was really slippery and had a nasty/chemical odor. Ended up returning it. Dish out an extra $30 for a Jade travel mat and forget this one.",2.0

"Too slippery, and the shipping package is way too big",2.0
It's slippery and has a rubber smell to it,2.0
Mat is slick and slippery. Not what you're looking for in a yoga mat. I kept thinking it would wear a little and get better but after a month of consistent practice it has not improved.,2.0
"These balls are trash. They fall apart after being hit a few times with a wooden bat. They however are good for pitching, my curveball, slider, and change up have great movement with these balls. Yet they do not carry off the bat and they fall apart easily, so it is not worth the money, even though they are cheap.",2.0
Too slippery for hot yoga and smells like chemicals,2.0
Its a nice mat but the 'gaiam' logo ran and made marks all over the mat on the very first time i used it.,2.0
"I purchased this mat about a year ago, and it's already time for another one. I practice yoga several times per week, and this mat just does not hold up to that regularity. There are now indentations where my hands/feet usually go, and the foam is starting to flake off with each practice.

I originally purchased this mat because I liked the thickness (5mm), but I've noticed that, while thick, I'm less stable on this than on my previous 3-mm mat. Also, it is very slippery when you first get it, but I stuck it out and now I don't slip around as much. There is definitely a breaking-in period.

Perhaps my biggest gripe with this mat, though, is the texture. At first, I liked it, but one day, my class did a heavy forearm-balance (pincha) practice, and the friction of my elbows against this mat left my elbows literally bloody. I had to grab a paper towel and apply some pressure to get it to stop in the middle of class. Now, I bring a shirt or towel to every class in case we have to do forearm balances. I tried using a yoga towel over the mat, but it didn't stick well to the mat and was a huge pain. I don't know why this mat in particular does this to my elbows, but it does.

This would be a good mat for beginners or people who don't practice that often. But for more seasoned practitioners, this will not do. I've had three yoga mats over the past 10 years (which I know is much less than most yogis go through), so I think I'm just going to bite the bullet and get the Manduka Pro (lifetime guarantee!).",2.0
"Disappointed with this mat.  I was expecting much more ""stickiness"" from a yoga mat.  It is really no different than a workout mat I already have.  If my hands are anything but completely dry, they slip in downward dog.  Since I already had the workout mat, this was a waste of my money.",2.0
"Slippery and hard to hold a downward dog, so had to replace with a better mat. Tried all sorts of cleaning methods to break it in and make it ""stickier"", but nothing really worked. Plus side is that it is cushiony and easier on the knees.",2.0
"No grip - was slipping around like I never have before on a mat. Also it's smelly, even after using several times.",2.0
"Very poor quality; texture is not suitable for practicing yoga. I sweat less than most people, and within the first five minutes of a yoga flow, I was slipping and sliding and unable to hold a pose. Returned to seller and bought a Manduka for just $30 more. $50 might seem like a lot for a yoga mat, but it's worth it to actually be able to use it.",2.0
"This was a horrible purchase experience. The mfg wrapped the product in a ridiculous amount of shrink wrap and mailing tape. After about 10 minutes of tearing at layer after layer of this garbage, I ended up cutting a huge gash in the product itself. The whole experience was absolutely absurd, I should have just chucked my cash in the black trash bag this thing came wrapped in. Save yourself the headache and get something different.",2.0
"They are the synthetic baseballs, thought they were leather, pay more for the leather balls.",2.0
Had for about  4 months wheel broke of it already.,2.0
"Have now had this for several months.  Works as advertised - for the most part, however a few points:
1. sometimes connecting the wheel can take some work.  Takes upwards of 15-20 seconds to get it on correctly.  Should just slide on.
2. when turning the wheel, it does take some work and the appearance is that the turning screw/shaft may have some issues down the road.
3. where the seat props up on the square bar behind it, is starting to cave in.  Just from sitting upright, this is happening.  Should have re-enforcement.
4. some instructions on how to stretch with the machine would have been nice/helpful",2.0
"It does the job, but it's not very well built. The padding on the seat and leg rests is very minimal and not comfortable. But it does work",2.0
"Got this as a gift still in the box.  The vinyl on the top of the seat already had two rips.  The machine does not sit level, and it doesn't seem as though birth legs are stretched evenly.  There is no way to tell whether you are increasing your stretch.  I get off and measure the best I can with measuring tape.  Not sure why this machine was rated higher than the Century machine.  Used he Century at the Do Jang and it is much better quality.  Paint has already scratched, cheap made in Tawain junk.  Worth $70-$100 not over &200.  If I had bought it myself I would send it back.",2.0
"it was cool while it last, the seat broke on me, i could still use it but did not get the back support i liked.  but it seems to work nice, and was a pretty quality a side from how mine broke.",2.0
"Given the hype,the resources,and the luminaries associated with this brand I was expecting more. I mean it's not premium anytime you can find it in most sporting and discount stores but,I hardly expected the gummy-ness or neoprene type odor to stay as long as it had before this mat was ""broken in"".Ok,at 5'7"" it was okay on length and my knees are""ok"" so I didn't have thickness issues but,when I had child's pose for the first two weeks of a 57 minute practice of power yoga I about wanted to wretch! Gaiam should listen to the market and let the manufacturer know to improve this mat. It's functionally passable. But,no more.",2.0
Bought this Stretcher the first day I used it I was getting out of it and the seat snapped. Very thin plywood and pading Iam going to keep it and reinforce my self it works but very cheaply built they could have done a much better job for very little money the worm gear works great but wouldnt buy again,2.0
No padding and slippery to floor and skin contact. But an appropriate price range. Good temporary mat to take and leave at vacation.,2.0
"Great colors, too thin and slippery. I do not sweat on my hands or feet but this mat doesn't even seem to get a grip with the floor.",2.0
I returned this mat because I was always sliding in down dog. Not only my feet would slide but my hands too.,2.0
"Very disappointed about this mat.  The first time I used it I slipped throughout my entire class.  I washed the mat afterwards and have used it twice since, and I still continue to slip.  I am unable to use this mat and will now research and purchase another one.",2.0
not necessarily bad quality but awfully slippery! you won't be able to do any yoga on this. not downward facing dog for you..,2.0
"Despite other reviews I went ahead with this mat.

It's very slippery though even when I'm doing anything like Power Yoga. I still have it though and use it every now and again.",2.0
My only complaint is that it didn't come in the color I was expecting. Purple is a nice color bur what I really wanted was the color shown in the images. I feel like I could have gotten a better quality mat somewhere else. The mat hurts my hands when I am doing downward dog.,2.0
"No smell, but a little too slippery when doing down dog or other.  Other then that it's OK  good value,  just not for me.",2.0
As a yoga instructor who teaches daily I have tried them all. This mat is thicker than most and while that may give some the padding they want under their knees I find it makes asanas less stable. I suggest a thinner sticky mat and using a towel under any questionable pressure areas. This mat is also not very durable and tears and rips just as easily as all the other PVC mats in this under $20 range. My suggestion? Buy a good rubber mat or suck it up and buy a Manduka which will last you forever.,2.0
Unfortunately this mat is not sticky at all and I kept sliding out of poses or wasn't able to hold a position steady. I had to return it. Gaim was most gracious in accommodating the return.,2.0
"The packaging on this didn't have any indication of what it was made of, despite the website advertising it as TPE ""eco"" mat.  I called Gaiam and after about 20 minutes of investigation (by a customer service rep who had never heard of TPE, and who didn't seem to know what PVC was either) my suspicions were confirmed that this is indeed a PVC mat.  She said that they would tell Amazon to change the description, although it has not been changed as of the time of this writing.  The ""Peace on earth"" mat isn't TPE either, only the reversible mat is TPE.",2.0
"I purchased the 10 X 50's to use while hunting, I hunt in Germany and they come in handy for the distance, the price was good but I was disappointed with the quality, they have double images and they fogged up a lot and then they fell apart.  They have a nice field of view but again they fell apart and had to ""screw"" them back together. So, makes it difficult when you try to see an animal at 200 meters away. I am not sure that I would buy this product again.",2.0
"The right eyepiece has an adjustment that was impossible to focus. Unfortunate, because the view looked great out of the left side that had no independent adjustment on the eyepiece.",2.0
"These are very inexpensive so I expected everything to be made of plastic, BUT they made the arms that support the eyepieces extremely thin and brittle. Out of the box I notice an odd distortion that could not be fixed with focus and within a few moments the left eyepiece popped right off. I don't know if it was damaged in shipping or if it was a defect. Once it came off the first thing I noticed was just how thin the eyepiece support is.

These might be good if you only plan to use them on vacation, you might consider them disposable because they are so cheap. Just be very gentle. I have other binos from Celestron that I'm very happy with, these are just a bit too cheap for their own good.",2.0
"The UpClose line of products so far is very convenient great product with great price!

I own the 8x40 (I needed these binoculars for a natural history course in my college, mostly for birding) which I love and I wanted to try the 10x50 which I didn't like at all.
Beside the fact I received them damaged I was disappointed to discover the zoom function which I'm not a big fan of. I have try other binoculars of several brands and all the ones with this function pretty much ruined the overall usage experience
Any way I return the 10x50 and order the Celestron 71133 UpClose 10x25 Roof Prism Binocular which I haven't receive yet but I believe it will be better then the 10x50.",2.0
I purchased this item from Amazon but unfortunately returned it the same day. The binoculars are very well built in my opinion but fall short optically. It seemed that the collimation was not properly set at the factory. There was slight double imaging and I was unable to achieve a good focus. This binocular deserves better lenses. I wish I could have kept it because besides the two problems noted I was impressed with the rest of it. Amazon did a good job with the packaging and made the return process painless.,2.0
Really bought it to carry my bo on the bike. I cannot see the shoulder strap staying connected for very long. Going to have to reinforce it somehow,2.0
I was very dissapointed that the valve on the pump do not work on my bike tires that require 125 of air pressure.  Does any one know how to make the pump work with all bicyles tires,2.0
"Or does this pump ""top out"" on you too easy. Within 2 pumps it seems to overfill the air chamber and become ""stuck"". I've sort of given up on it and use the communal bike pump at my work. Seems I should have spent more $$ for a pump that works :/",2.0
It is made of a thin plastic that after the first use it already seemed like it started to break. I thought it would be more durable as my bike tires need to be inflated to 100PSI but to fully get my tires inflated you nearly have to break the pump. I will update my review later after I have had more time to use it.,2.0
"It repeatedly got caught in the valve and trapped/released air in the pump's hose.  the handle is flimsy, and I'm not sure if there was an issue with airflow or the gauge was inadequate, but I'll try my luck with another pump. As they say... you get what you pay for.",2.0
"Does the product work? Yes.

Is it a quality product? Definitely not.

For $18.33 (plus shipping), I expected something of decent quality, but the enter thing is made from cheap plastic and feels like it'll fall apart within a few months of use. There's a small plastic stand to hold it up and the nozzle is about as cheap as you can find.",2.0
"Nice, but the lid separated after only a week.  Tried supergluing it but happened again.  For the price, I expected more.  Disappointed.",2.0

"In less than 4 months, it already did not keep water hot any more.",2.0
"I really liked it except for one thing ... one major thing. The bottom plastic captures water between the plastic and the container when you wash it. When I would pour my coffee later, the trapped water would pour out onto the counter. I'm not talking about a couple of drops. I got tired of cleaning up the leaking water, so I returned it and bought something different. In the picture I'm attaching, hopefully you can see how much water came out while pouring one cup of coffee. This happened all day long. This was a bad design.",2.0
"I was disappointed! after using it three times the cover came apart, it revealed that the styrofoam inside was not completely covered.  I am beginning to smell mildew.",2.0
The title really says it all...I brewed 8 cups worth of coffee and albeit the product does a great job at keeping it warm all through the day.  I dare say I could find an equally low quality build for much cheaper!! I only wish the person that gifted this to me had given me the receipt as well so I could return it. This item was not bought through Amazon.,2.0
"Flip it over and see where it's made.
Stainless seperated from cup within 2 days.
Everything that I put inside mine comes out tasting like yummy chinese chemicals!

Final thoughts- overpriced peice of Chinese plastic with some pretty trim. Does keep stuff hot, though.",2.0
"it keeps stuff hot forever.. but the base holds water from washing and it constantly drips out when pouring,, or soaks my work bag when i travel..
 probably taking it back and looking for another model with out the water trap handle/base",2.0
"We had to return this Thermos because it was not good for the application we were using it in, which may not be everyone's, but we weren't happy.  We used it to store our son's whole milk on the go.  It did keep the milk cold for as long as possible (with ice packs) but the problem lied in cleaning it.

It's not dishwasher safe.  I called and asked to make sure.  They said to use denture tablets and I think lemon to clean it.  They said it's not recommended for milk, okay, but what IS for milk?  Seems like nothing.  Long story short, it's such a tall vessel that even using a bottle brush leaves it not fully clean.  Many days I'd use vinegar and let it soak endlessly with hot water, but what a pain.  It still contained odors.  The problem is when you remove the decorative cap (you can drink out of), the top of the vessel tapers and doesn't allow a sponge or much of anything inside to clean it.  For us it was a nightmare to clean.  And I can't imagine putting soup in here, the smell could be horrid.  Maybe all it is good for is coffee/tea for which case it should say ""only use for coffee & tea"".

Secondly, when pouring it does slightly leak water (from rinsing and cleaning).  Somehow it traps water.  I didn't realize this until pouring milk in the car and water dripped onto my pant legs: quite a lot too!

For some applications this may be good, but for us it wasn't.  I switched to a dishwasher-""durable"" Thermos Intak water bottle and so far so good.  Sorry...

On the plus side it was sturdy looking, durable, held a lot of liquid, and attractive.  Big handle though.",2.0
would inflate but took a long time end up using electric pump,2.0

"I really wanted to like this tent. But after living with it for a few days, I'm truly disappointed that it doesn't have a floor. For the amount of money they're asking for this product - it should. And a mesh draining floor at that. In the morning the tent is filled with spiders, flies and bugs and I just have this uneasy feeling that I'm going to find a snake in there one of these days. Or maybe one will just come to visit while I'm in there.

Secondly, it doesn't have a rainfly, so if you're using this as a port-a-potty and you get hit with a rainstorm, you need to make sure it's been treated with a heavy duty silicone spray and that your toilet paper is in a zip lock bag. And lastly, though it's a bit nit picky, I do not like the ridiculous company name ""CleanWaste"" emblazoned on the top front of the tent. Just about anything would be better...How about: TotalWaste, CompleteWaste, WhatAWaste, SuchAWaste?

These are sold by the same maker, Coghlan, but don't seem to be as hard and I don't know if they will work as well.  There are a couple other sellers on Amazon that still sell the Pink Lady candles so I guess I'll have to check them out",2.0

- it is in fact a rosin bag

- it is tiny, the product description is misleading.  Product Dimensions are listed as 4x1x6, which would make sense for a rosin bag that you want to put behind the pitchers mound.

Honestly my kids don't care, and continue to use it, but anyone used to using even a cheap full-size cue will find this borderline unusable.  So I'd say that for children just playing around, it's fine--otherwise, keep looking.",2.0

It is not a proper shorty pool cue but really just a kid's toy, and not worth $15.
Minnesota Fats would be appalled to see his name on this cue.",2.0
You get what you pay for. This broke on me as I tried to loosen it from my cleaning rod. I had to use a drill and plenty of patience to take it out without damaging the rod. Sticking with the metal cleaning equipment from now on.,2.0
Its working. thats all i can say about it,2.0
"Not the best quality you can get got the money, the metal tab is light weight steel, bends easily.",2.0
"I bought this for use on a daily-carry folding knife that has high-carbon steel (meaning that despite being 'stainless' it will rust relatively easily over time when carried in a pocket). My hope was to keep the blade coated in Dri-Lube full time to avoid rust while keeping lint from sticking to the blade.

The reason this gets two stars, rather than one, if because it works. It will lubricate. It will keep lint from sticking. It will not leave oily residue on your fingers.

The reason it only gets two stars is because it does not evaporate to a clear, even finish as I was anticipating based on the description. It does evaporate off the blade once sprayed on, but it leaves white, blotchy residue on the knife, akin to wax, but much harder to remove. If I was going to store a knife long term, this might be a viable option. In that case however, I'd have no qualms using a normal oil.

For use on a knife blade, I recommend against this. I tried it on three different blades of different steels, from various distances and thicknesses.

For hinges and area where metal rubs on metal, this might be a good choice. It will scrape off too easily for heavy rubbing surfaces though. Not suitable for firearms.",2.0
"Used it once. The materials and construction appear well made. And its easy (for the recommended two people) to put up and take down. But unfortunately, out of the box, the colors in the canvas appeared to have bled through slightly from one side to the other. Almost like the canvas was folded up when the ink had not entirely dried. So there's a faded ""tie die' effect on both the exterior and interior fabrid. Returning it to Amazon. Hesitant to buy another to see if this initial item's problem was a fluke.",2.0
Was broken when we received it.,2.0
"Not great quality.  First one shipped was broken, had to ship replacement.  Paint job on tent was sloppy.  Don't waste your money, find a better one!",2.0
"I purchased a Smooth Fitness CE Elliptical on December 22, 2005.  The unit was delivered on January 10, 2006.  I paid an extra $100 to have the unit uncrated and set up in my exercise room.  The delivery person setting up my unit had never seen an elliptical trainer before and wound up setting it up improperly.  After about 30 min. of use the next day, the unit started to make a high pitch squeal.  I submitted a service request on January 11, 2006.  It took two weeks before someone contacted me.  On the day that my elliptical was to be serviced, the service agent never showed up causing me to waste a vacation day.  When I called Fitness Contractors to inquire as to what had happened, the woman answering the phone was extremely rude and hung up on me.  I was so frustrated by the whole service experience that I eventually returned my Smooth Fitness CE elliptical for a full refund.  I plan to purchase a Schwinn 438 elliptical trainer in its place.",2.0
Received less than half empty disappointed on volume in container.,2.0
I haven't tried the product yet so I can't comment on how good or bad it is.  When I received it and opened it the container looked half empty so I decided to weight the contents on my scale set to ounces.  It only measured 1 and 3/8 ounces.  The jar says it contains 2 ounces.  That did not make me happy.  I like to get what I pay for.,2.0
"Clumpy rather than smooth texture... Maybe I just got a bad batch, but this was pretty useless to me.",2.0
"very expensive for a small amount of product. You can make you own by getting 100% silicone and diluting it 50% with mineral spirits. I needed a gallon of seam seal and this would have cost like 500$ for that much. Product worked great, but its jsut way too expensive to do large jobs.",2.0
"It worked great the first time, then after that, forget about it. The entire tube dried up after its first use.",2.0
"The product is as expected.  However, when I received it, it had obviously been previously used by someone.  Not only was there no tamper-proof seal (I am not sure whether the manufacturer put one on there) but someone had obviously taken some of the grease out with a comb-style object.",2.0
"I ordered one of these ear guards. It arrived obviously returned by someone before. There was a sticky note saying 'Defective' and 4 sticky arrows signs attached pointing to the velcro areas that seemed not to stick well on 4 spots that are over top of a head. I returned the ear guard for replacement, and received a new one with seemingly the same problem. The earguard works, but the velcro lock seems unreliable. I kept this one, just so I don't return a second of the same kind of an item... But I think it is not supposed to be made this way. If it does not grip well from the start, how many times it will take for velcros to lose the grip altogether?",2.0
I am not very happy with this cooler.  It doesnt keep ice frozen for very long!,2.0
"Mine is missing one of the handles. Looks like it fell off at some point in the production process. Still works, and I'm not using it to carry around, so it's fine. But a replacement handle and pin would be nice.",2.0
I had the exact same cooler but it was insulated this is not insulated only holds the ice for half a day was misled by this cooler,2.0
Would work well for a picnic but I wouldn't recommend for camping. It didn't hold ice for longer than 24 hours in 70 degree weather. It was kept in the shade and rarely opened. There was also a frozen block of meat and we still couldn't keep ice.,2.0
Get the dark blue one. The red is cheaper because it has cheaper hinges and no insulation.,2.0
Not the greatest cooler... Bags of ice melt within a day (in 60-70 degree weather). Lid is nearly impossible to open. We haven't had a great experience with this one.,2.0
"Nice cooler and great size except the lid does not stay open, the drain is not screw-in so it can easily dislodge and ruin your car, the hinge is junk and will break easily, the handles are junk and will break soon, but the price is great. Here's the cooler I bought instead: Rubbermaid 50 Qt. Insulated Modern Red Cooler.",2.0
"It's a cheap and basic cooler, and you get what you pay for. I get that. So I don't mind -for this price- that the walls seem thin, or that the lid is not as sturdy as our other Coleman cooler. I do however mind that the hinges are attached with one plastic rivet per hinge, instead of two metal screws. Our older Coleman 28 qt cooler (model 6277) on the left with 4 screws per hinge vs. this cooler with 2 screws and one plastic rivet per hinge (see photo). This does not seem like a construction that would last more than 1 or 2 years. Also, the lid does not stay open. We're sending this back.",2.0
It's a cooler and works well.  However I find it difficult to open once closed.  I've had several coolers that were easy to get into. I could not get any leverage to pull open the top.  The last Coleman I had a small flap handle that you could grip. This one doesn't.  I would not recommend this cooler.,2.0
"I bought this cooler thinking of good price and very famous brand. However, the insulation is very poor and could not keep the temperature.
Very disappointed.",2.0
"Looked good, seemed good. Stuff stays cold, but what the heck...one of the handles fell off the second time we used it.  My wife was picking it up from the car's back seat, and oops, one handle fell off.  That's just lame.  Very disappointed.  This should not happen.  I thought Coleman made better stuff, this was like a piece of cheap Chinese-made junk.",2.0
cheap,2.0
Came broken in the box. Felt cheap so returned and didn't repurchase.,2.0
Very light and low quality but price was right.,2.0
The lid closes/will not stay open.  Very annoying when you are trying to load it or keep it open to air out.  We have never had issues forgetting to close a cooler so this is not a useful feature.,2.0
I'm giving it 2 stars because the lid doesn't stay up. Hits me on the head once I get it opened. It's suction is way to tight. I've broken nails on this cooler ladies.,2.0
"Spacious.  Didn't seems to keep items as cold as I'd like over several hours (lots of melted ice).  Drain works well.

Handle design is good in theory, but while moving an empty cooler, one handle broke.",2.0
"Size is good, it's lighter than my last one. That's were my good review ends. It's cheaper, handles don't feel like they will last long. Lid is hard to open, small finger hold to open, and the lid won't stay open for loading and unloading. The hinge looks cheap so I am afraid to bend it back too far. Glad it wasn't too expensive because it won't last long.",2.0
"pros: spacious, nice handles, it's a cooler.
Cons: I kept this in the shade, temp didn't get above75 outside and the ice melted in 5 hours. Didn't keep my food or drinks cold on our camping trip.",2.0
It is not the quality I expected. the hinges are plastic and I should have sent it back.,2.0
"Impossible to open, falls over. Spend a little more and get a good one.",2.0
"I know that this is a relatively inexpensive cooler but the hinges on this thin are very cheap. Upon opening the lid the very first time, the hinges were tight and almost ripped out of the back of the cooler.",2.0
"Bought this to go camping down in the keys. Loaded it up with food/beverages and full of ice and put it in the back of the truck. By the time we got down there, approximately six hours, most of the ice had melted. The cooler was in a covered truck bed out of direct sunlight and the temperature never was hotter that low 80's. Used it for the remaining four days of the trip and twice a day we would have to fill it up with ice. Was always under some sort of shade, never left the lid open for extended length of time, and temp never rose above 85. Really disappointed in the cooler. Was expecting a little more. Even one refill of ice a day would have been an improvement.",2.0
"KEEPS ICE FOR 24(read 6) hours! Totally false advertising.

One day we even left it closed and I had a sun reflector on it blocking any sun from heating it up, while it was under a free in 70 degree weather. Ice gone in less than 8 hours and we didn't open it once because we were hiking. My trader joe's freezer bag would have kept stuff frozen longer.",2.0
"Cooler ok, but the rivets for the handles pop out. I had to put a rod through to keep the handles on. PIA",2.0
It arrived with broken handles.  I needed to use it immediately and it's too bulky to bother trying to return anyway so I guess I'll just use rope or something.,2.0
Nice cooler but the handle Broke the second time I used it with ice and beer.,2.0
Almost impossible to open and lid won't stay open. A cheap product.,2.0
"I purchased a pair of these to transport eggs in standard cartons to my clients. The selling point was the fact that the description in the Amazon ad states some very specific internal measurements, that should have been ample for my purposes. Sadly, the items I received had even smaller internal dimensions than the older coolers that I was already using. These are probably just fine for the average camper/picnic-er person, it just wasn't described accurately and isn't suitable for my purposes.",2.0
so so  quality fair,2.0
"all I can say is we gave it away , we tried it and lost all our ice in one day and it was kept in the shade",2.0
Priced a little high.,2.0
"Received this cooler today and right out of the box I could see that it was cheaply made.  I'm surprised that its a Coleman as I've had Coleman's in the past and they've been great.  My cooler has insulation oozing out of the seams between the red exterior and white interior as well as on the seams on the handles.  Haven't loaded it up yet but I'm expecting that when the insulation hanging out of the seams gets wet, mold will follow.  Probably isn't worth the shipping and hassle to send it back.  Wouldn't recommend this model.

November 18, 2014 - Also, Coleman coolers I've had in the past have had hinges that allow the lid to stay in the open position.  This cooler has 2 pieces of plastic screwed into the lid at both ends and attached to the cooler itself so that the lid just snaps back closed unless you hold it up.",2.0
"Not a bad little cooler. Up until today used it mainly to house raw oysters during get togethers with friends.  Lid doesn't always want to stay open, but no big deal.  However, today I picked it up to remove it from the car. With a bag of half melted ice and just a few bottles of water, the handle broke. It has to plastic pins that hold it in place, but the hole that retains the pin in the handle itself cracked. Fortunately, the other end of the handle is the same, so I just reversed it.  But when that one cracks, the cooler won't be easy to move around. Very disappointed!",2.0
the size of this cooler is not the dementions they say it is. it suppossed to be 25Lx14Wx13.5 deep. it is not. it is 23 3/4 X13 3/16 X14 1/8. way smaller than it says on line.,2.0
"It's a cooler and at the end of the day, it's just going to be painted but the fact that it looked like the handles were held on there with some gorilla glue. Then the back hinged don't really bend back, they kind of bounce back and close on their own really sucks. Overall, just go to Wal*Mart to get your coolers. That way you can see if they look like they were glued together. The only reason I'm not returning it is because the shipping on it would be INSANE (like $13) and I'm just covering it in paint and it will be more a decorative item.",2.0
"The commercial makes this look so easy but if you have bad knees, forget it.  I'm 54, arthritic and out of shape.  I could not use this machine for longer than 3 minutes at a time.  It was a waste of my money and I gave it to my daughter who is using it.  The bottom line is, you have to be in decent shape to use this or else it just sits on the floor gathering dust.",2.0
"This is not as easy as it looks on tv.  Thats fine and I don't mind the challenge.  However, the motion is not as smooth as they make it seem on tv.  Im pretty coordinated and don't have difficulty find a rhythm but the motion seems jerky and like it sticks.  I oiled the places it suggestied in the guidbook but I don't think it helped at all.  It definitely doesnt look or feel like it would hold up to daily use for even a few months.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!  I saw a lot of negative reviews about customer service however I haven't dealt with them so my review is soley based on the product.",2.0
"Just wanted to echo what I have read here and experienced myself:  I'm a trucker and had this piece of equipment for a couple years before I started using it and it was great!  Except after only a couple of months now, indeed it has broken down, the squeaking was bothersome but I lived with it, and the tension bar did fail.  But I still had a great workout until yesterday when the actual metal bar beneath the pedal literally began splitting in two and it's now a piece of junk.  I'm not abnormally overweight, just 145lbs or so when I started using the LTT.  I loved what it did for me all the way until the thing completely broke down, and the workouts were only 35 minutes a day.  So I have to echo the other remarks of poor quality for a product with a great initial idea behind it.  I won't be buying another one.",2.0
"When I first bought this product I lost about 15 pounds in two months, but a few months after, the chain broke.  I bought another one because the first had worked so well (and I thought I had done something to make the thing break) but then that one broke as well!  About a year later my boyfriend surprised me with another, more compact one, but, ok course, this one is right at the brink of breaking down!  This worked, but it was definatly not worth the $250 all together!",2.0
"I bought my LTT about a year ago to help get rid of the baby fat I had gained from my pregnancy. I used it 6 days a week for 30 min. and also used 5 lb. free weights while using the machine. It started squeking about three months after I bought it but it wasn't too much of an annoyance with the TV on however, the chain has broken four times already and the hook that connects the chain has now broken. I only weigh 156 pounds, so I can't be the problem. My husband has fixed it everytime that it has broke but when the hook that connects the chain broke last night, my husband suggested buying something else because it is becoming time consuming and costly to fix this machine every other day (literally).<br />
I would say spend your money on something else, although heavy, the gears and chain construction is not good.",2.0
"My boyfriend and I have only had the Lateral Thigh Trainer for about 2 weeks now.  I bought it from a Target store so I didn't have to deal with shipping, good thing cause it's very heavy.  So this is what we've found:<br />
1) I don't really feel like I've exercised, even after doing 500-1000 steps non-stop.  There's a small feeling of exercising my calfs and thighs, but I get a better workout going up the 40 stairs to my office at work.  And there's no way it's working my abs.<br />
<br />
2) Machine puts you in horrible positions.  Your feet are asked to stand in a pigeon-toed position which is very unnatural and it makes my ankles hurt.  Definitely not recommended for a person with joint problems.  Plus when standing on it, I find myself swaybacked trying to keep my balance and gain a sense of standing in a stable position, so it puts a ton of pressure on my lower back.<br />
<br />
3) Machine's tension settings aren't challenging.  The pedal positions are too awkward for you to safely go at a fast pace, and the ""slow burn"" setting is hardly challenging.  Even if I put it all the way to that setting, only after doing 50-100 step the lever has creeped its way to the easy setting.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, the motion is simple enough that you can do it while watching TV or playing video games.<br />
<br />
I guess this maching is ok if you don't have a bad back or joint problems, but I think your money would be better invested in a standard stepper.  <br />",2.0

Its not a good bat. Played with it against a hard tennis ball and handle came out easily after 3 weeks. I won't recommend to buy unless you are playing with a light tennis ball..,2.0
"The bat arrived on time in perfect condition. However, this bat is too heavy to be used for tennis ball cricket, and the grip hurts if used with bare hands. The weight is more close to what a leather ball bat should be. I have not tried using it on a leather ball but if you are looking for a tennis ball bat, look elsewhere.",2.0
"My daughter haaaad to have this toy, bugged us for daaaays, so I finally ordered it an think I paid about $12 plus shipping. first I put air in it, and it did nothing cool like you see on the commercial. so we took it to the store and had them put helium in it. That's the only thing that makes this toy fun, and she does like it. But I was just picking up the house (the things lying in my living room, where ya gonna store a 3 ft inflated Mylar disc?)and noticed the edges of the toy are all worn and the ring in poking out in several places. The thing is no different from the Mylar balloons you get at the grocery store, it's just bigger and flatter, and has a ring in it. We've had it about 2 weeks, maybe she's played with it 4 times. Bottom line, the toys not worth 12 bucks (plus shipping!). If they were selling these at wal-mart for 5 buck maybe it'd be alright. But they need to make the thing more durable if they want to sell them on the net, otherwise they will keep getting ""junk"" reviews.",2.0
"Lasted about an hour of normal play.  While it was alive, kids had a ball, er. disk, with it.  If only it was made out of one of those high-tech materials from NASA that they use to survive re-entry.  Now, that would be a good toy.",2.0
"My daughter bought this with her own money. We brought it home, filled it up and it was torn within the first 2 tosses. It tore just a little at the edge, but it was just enough to let the air leak out. I contacted the company and got no response. She loved it and was upset when it ripped. Don't waste your money.",2.0

"This version ""Two"" ruined the great design that made the original Tusa Liberator Plus uniquely great. The original had a very wide top of nose pocket so the mask would not dig into your forehead or nose. Version ""Two"" changed this unique feature so the nose pocket is narrow at the top like all other masks and I can't wear it.

There is a huge market opportunity to sell masks that are _not_ low profile, for snorkling not scuba. After all, not many snorklers do scuba too and scuba folks can buy specialized low profile masks that are very uncomfortable in pressing into forehead or nose. No sense in having low profile masks for snorkelers who don't go below 10 feet deep.",2.0
"The mask was very big.  I have a normal size face, oval.  The bottom part of the mask was almost touching my upper lip.  However, the rubber part was very soft and comfortable.  The mask was not new as described.  It was clearly used and returned because the lens were foggy, not clear, as if someone had spit in it and swished their spit around with their finger or used a solution with their fingers to defog the mask.  I suggest NOT ordering from GearUpGuide / Lancaster Scuba Storefront which is who I ordered the mask from.",2.0
I bought while they were priced at about $18. These are way too expensive for the quality you get. The socks were kind of thin and loose on my foot. Costco has some wool socks that come to be like $5/pair and they are way nicer. I won't buy these again.,2.0
"Tried both medium and large sizes with different shoes, and it still hurts!
This product may be great for others, but it hurts my leg.",2.0
"I purchased three of these for my night diving lights.  They seem to be heavy duty construction. But, there is a lot of inconsistency in the production quality of the brass snap bolts.  Two of the three had sharp edges, one of which cut my thumb when I first tried to open the snap.  One of the snaps took a lot of working to get it to slide easily.  I had to file down the sharp edges to make them safe for use in the water.  The manufacturer should have checked these parts before assembly, or at least before shipping to customers, which makes me suspicious about the long term durability of the product, specifically where the phone cord is mounted to the nylon strap (which looks kind of cheezy).  As expensive as dive lights are, I'm not sure I'm willing to risk losing one with these lanyards.  The lanyards aren't worth the price.",2.0
"When i went to use these magnifiers, one of the lenses was out of its storage pocket and was crimped by the lid of the storage box.  As a result that lens would not mount to the dive mask.  My error was assuming they would be properly packaged.  I would suggest inspecting the lenses upon receipt.",2.0
"The lenses themselves are fine, it's the adhesion to the mask that's a problem.  I washed both mask and lenses with soapy water as directed, rinsed both and positioned lenses on the inside surface of mask, dried with a towel and allowed to dry for 24 hours.  I took them to Jamaica and went diving via Sandals and as soon as I put the defogger in and rinsed them in the rinse tank, the lenses came loose and started sliding around the glass.  I positioned them properly before the dive but as water got into the mask, the lenses began floating around the glass face plate.  After rinsing my mask again in the rinse tank, I noticed they had dislodged from the glass and were now floating in the rinse tank.  I did not recover them.  The adhesive method needs to be improved drastically.",2.0
"This product said it had a ""Corrosion Resistant Spring Loaded Gate Clip"" but it looks like it is just a regular type clip like a dog leash has.  I can see this clip coming open if you rub up against something while snorkeling and you could lose your underwater camera which is what I plan on using it for. It did arrive really fast.",2.0
Didn't stay in the mark even after following the directions and testing multiple times. Returned.,2.0
Might be premature to write this however I am STILL trying to get them to stick inside my mask. They may very well be going back for a refund. I'm pretty bummed...,2.0
"For the price I would say these are a ripoff. They didn't seem to work at all, after I properly applied them to my dive mask. In two separate dives, they were not at all helpful in my reading of my dive computer, which was the sole reason I wanted them. Once I took them off I could actually see better than with them on! I got the 2.0 diopter strength. I expected them to be optical glass but they were just very clear elastomeric plastic that effectively stuck to the inside of the dive mask. By the way, I am quite confident I had them installed correctly. If, down the road, I decide I need an Rx sort of dive mask correction I'll just pay the $50 for a custom one, since these are no great bargin at over 2/5ths of that cost.",2.0
Looses adhesion in Water?,2.0

"items was way too big for my leg, can not use it, it is a lot larger than it looks",2.0
"they are good, just overpriced

also - only about 60-70% wool. the rest synthetic. If I can ever find socks like these that are 90% wool, I'd spend extra",2.0
"The installation was as easy as advertised, but under water they became cloudy and obscured my vision. They also make the use of a soap defogger problematic, because of the way they slide around. If you have to use a corrective lens, then just use one of the pair, and mount it low in your field of vision of your dominant eye.",2.0
"When they stuck to the mask they worked well, but prior to my first dive I went to rinse my mask and noticed they became loose. One the second dive my wife rinsed my mask and when I put the mask on they were gone.",2.0
I did not use these.  After I received this and I inspected it I realized that the magnifier lenses were too thick and really not necessary for inside snorkeling mask which is what I was going to use them for.  Going to send them back.,2.0

"Definitely not as good as Darn Tough. While I enjoyed the SmartWool to begin with, they absolutely do not have the durability/longevity of Darn Tough socks. If you are going to spend in the $15-$20 range, just go with Darn Tough, which makes a better and more comfortable sock and it lasts longer.",2.0
"The first time I discovered Smartwool socks I thought that I had died and gone to heaven. The socks were so incredibly comfortable, fast drying and odor resistant I couldn't believe that I had worn and suffered through plain cotton socks for so many years years.

But something has changed. The socks barely lost 8 to 10 months before holes started appearing in either the toe or heel area. And I'm not just talking about one pair in five or one pair in six I'm talking about every pair I have bought, and maybe more importantly, YOU will buy.

You will absolutely love the socks the day that you receive them. You will love them even six months afterward. But before year is done I guarantee you you will have holes in them and you will not be happy.

I switched over to Darn Tough Socks. While I don't believe that they have the same odor resistance as pure 100% wool (DTS have some Nylon in them), these socks have an unconditional lifetime guarantee. They are also slightly more expensive, but I am enraged that I have lost upwards of 10 pairs of socks to various holes and thinning with Smartwool.

I am REALLY REALLY displeased as these are not cheap socks, and they should last! I am totally unhappy with whatever has been happening with this company and their production methods. Get your act together Smartwool, you had a great product and you need to go back to making these however you were before.",2.0
"I have a couple old pairs of Smartwool socks that have lasted ten or more years of traveling and hiking around the world. Multi-day hikes in a constant downpour in New Zealand - my feet were the only dry and comfortable part of me.

My most recent two pairs of Smartwools have multiple holes in them from less than one year of light use.

I have to conclude that like everything else, Smartwool is not what it used to be. While growing into a mass-market product, they've kept the price but taken out the quality.",2.0

"Researched for weeks before buying. Read a lot of reviews and several complained of the Pro mat being slippery. Read all about the salt break in, and that with use it will get better.

Considering the companys reputation and the positive review out numbered the slippery complaints Got a Manduka Pro Float.

First what I love, why I bought it. 1. The color/pattern. Float color reminds me of the ocean, when Im most at peace. 2. The padding, 6MM is wonderful for my knees. 3. The mat stays put, it not going to move, heavy and stable. 4. The length, 85 is wonderful!

What I don't like, and runis the mat for me. The mat is slippery, with sweat. Not just a little but, super slippery about 30 minuets In to a practice. I did the salt treatment 2x before I first use. i practice 6x a week for the last 4 weeks and clean it with Manduka mat wash. Still the same, slip. I don't want to be required to use a mat towel, Im not doing hot yoga. If this is the case it should come with a towel. This was an investment for me so Ill stick it out, until I can replace.

Knowing what I know today I would not buy this. I wish Manduka would exchange this for a eKo mat, I read they are thinner but have better wet grip. A refund would also work. Under their famous warranty the policy reads, no returns after you break in the mat. Seeing as I had to do this before use. The lifetime warranty is not really as comprehensive as they make it out to be.

If this changes, the mat gets grippy or I get an exchange Ill gladly update my review.",2.0
Extremely heavy and slippery,2.0
"I research a lot on which yoga mat to buy. I bought the Manduka PRO Yoga on Black Verve,  because I wanted to have better grip, but it was the slippery mat I could ever buy. I do everything as instructed, sea salt and 24 hours at the sun but it doesnt work at all. Now I have to use socks and gloves in order to prevent of falling.",2.0
It is a blue backing on a very green mat.  Nothing like the picture!,2.0
This thing weighs like 30lbs. Its a workout just carrying it!,2.0
Slippery. Even after it is worn in. Even after cleaning according to the instructions. Sweat and this mat do NOT go together. You sweat in yoga. Its a yoga mat.,2.0
The Harbor color is much brighter than pictured.  The mat is good thickness heaviness.  I agree with some other reviews- still slippery after pretreating with sea salt.  Think I will return and try something else.,2.0
"I own a liforme mat and I have been spoiled by its grippiness but thought I would give this a try since I needed a back up mat with more durability. Honestly should have listened to the complaints. I am constantly worried of injuring myself when on this mat, wishing I could return it but it's been 2 months. The pros: it's wide and cushiony and will last a lifetime. The cons: it's slippery",2.0
"I really wanted to like this mat... but I couldn't get over the slipperiness. After having a few conversations with classmates and teachers at the yoga studio, I think the problem is inherently with the material. Mats made from PVC tend to give a slippery grip when your hands and feet start to sweat, which, if you're reading this, you have probably already experienced on a cheap mat. This mat, fancy and suuuuuuper comfy as it is, has PVC as its primary material, which means it will *always* be prone to slipping. The closed-cell foam design, while excellent for hygiene and wear resistance, blocks any pathways for moisture on your limbs to transport away from the contact point... which means that grip is especially compromised in sweaty conditions. I read about the salt scrubs, the chemical degreasing treatments, and countless other methods for de-filming the surface and roughening it up a little, but the way I see it there is really no good way to ever get this properly broken in for yoga (if you're a nama-sweaty yogi like myself, that is...).

Outside of the few poses where grip is really important (e.g., lunges, warriors, down dogs), I must say that the feel of this mat is absolutely incredible. I found it to be exceptionally easy on my knees and really supportive during floor poses. For a practice heavy in balancing postures, for yin/restorative work, or maybe even for Pilates, this mat would be fantastic. Sadly, for my humble vinyasa flow practice, it would not do the job and had to make its way back to Amazon.

For what it's worth, I discovered that a rubber mat is way better suited for a sweaty yogi demanding of grip, such as myself. Unfortunately, these are hard to come by in extra-long sizes, which is a must for me at 6'5"". Two options exist to my knowledge at the time of this writing: the Jade Harmony XW (natural rubber) and Lululemon's The Reversible (Big) Mat (synthetic rubber). The Lulu clocks in at 84"", which beats Jade by 4""... so I went with the Lulu. For what it's worth, it is an amazing improvement in grip and actually absorbs sweat which makes it a dream for practice. My plan is to clean it regularly with the vinegar-water solution and dispose/replace at the first sign of ickiness. Maybe Manduka will have a lovely rubber version of the extra-long PRO by then?? :-)",2.0
I like the pad okay: it's secure both for my feet and for the chair I need to use. But it is HEAVY! By far the heaviest yoga mat anyone I know has ever seen. Hard to lug around.,2.0
I tried breaking the mat in with sea salt and usage but my hands and feet still slipped doing simple yoga poses in the home. Disappointed especially given the rave reviews by experienced yogis. Have to return it.,2.0
"As a moderate to heavy sweater, I don't recommend this mat for the like. It's just too slippery, even after putting it through the salt treatment prescribed by the manufacturer. Seems to me part of the problem is that the small ridges in the mat run vertically instead of horizontally, thus making slipping more likely. One's attention should be focused on yoga, NOT concerned about slipping and being injured.",2.0
I was so excited for this mat and wanted to love it but just can't.  For $117 I did not expect to be sliding all over the place to the point of where I was afraid I'd get injured.  I went back to class a few days later and wouldn't even use my brand new mat.  My teacher even tested it and felt it was too slippery. Really disappointed and am hoping I can return this mat!,2.0
"Good quality if you don't mind slipping all over. It feels like there's oil or lotion all over the mat. I slid and almost broke my neck in downward dog. I know people LOVE manduka mats but I needed more grip. Yes, I did the Salt treatment. But at these prices, can't they just do that before they sell them?!?  The Giaim Sol sticky is what I ended up with!",2.0
I loved the length and the cushioning of this mat but the slippage was so bad I couldn't properly practice.  I used all of Manduka's tips and tricks but nothing helped.  I am so disappointed that an expensive mat was so slippery.  Total waste of money.,2.0
So Its been about a month with two sessions a week and multiple home remedy washes to remove the film.. but Im still slipping. I cant help but see the jade mats in class and wish I went that route instead. I was hopeful that some of the negative reviews would just be a few exceptions but my Hands constantly slip and im not doing hot yoga or sweating a lot. HOWEVER- this mat has great cushion and I love the texture of the mat/color/width/ & weight. Just not the initial smell and the fat that I scrubbbed and salted it four plus times before using. The size and weight is comfortable to carry a few blocks to class with a sling. Keeping my fingers crossed that it just needs more breaking in... jade ones do not require this and lack the chemically smell when first buying it.,2.0
"Even after salting it twice, the mat is too slippery to use.",2.0
"I just started at yoga and wanted something eco-friendly that would last and that I could use in hot yoga. I didn't want the Jade as I'd read concerns about its strong smell, and while I've heard amazing things about Lululemon's mat, I didn't want to support that particular business.

Well, I slightly regret not getting the Lulu mat. This thing is SLIPPERY. I knew that would likely be an issue, but after SCRUBBING the heck out of this thing with kosher salt, it's like a slip & slide 20 minutes into hot yoga. I spoke to a friend in my yoga class with the same mat who's had his many months now (and thus had more time to break his in) and he said it's gotten a tad better, but really the thing is just a slippery mess.

It is a good mat otherwise and I will try the salt treatment again, and will use yogitoes or some other yoga towel on it during hot yoga, but I have just resigned myself to the fact I bought the wrong mat for my needs. :(",2.0
"to heavy,
slippery in some tips of yoga,",2.0
This mat is coated with what is probably a release agent used in making it. The coating makes the mat slippery. The cleaning procedure shown on the package will not remove it. Removing the coating requires repeated cleaning with a strong detergent and thorough rinsing. A mat at this price point should not require such preparation for use.,2.0
"Mat is slippery, especially when you have been working out and sweating.",2.0

"As a kid I loved my Slip-N-Slide. But for vinyasa yoga...

I waited to write this review. I waited over a year, to see if the mat would finally be broken in. It is not broken in. It's just as slippery as when I first tried it. Yoga is hard enough that you shouldn't have to worrying about injuring yourself because of the mat. (Injure yourself because you did a position incorrectly like you're supposed to.) I was cheap mat guy for years. This was to be my first adult, ""I can kinda do downward dog now""/not the sweatiest and most nervous guy in the room, mat. Now I often use one of my old cheap ones instead of this one. I kick myself for not getting a different, expensive mat. Guess I'll have to get a expensive mat (again).

I called Manduka when I first got it. They told me to check out the ""salt"" video (an athletic woman dumping coarse salt then sensually rubbing, coming back later and yoga-ing it all up). I did the coarse sea salt thing and the only result I got was my girlfriend suspiciously wondering (after she returned from a trip) why, for weeks, she kept stepping on sand or something in our apartment. The sea salt did nothing. Washing and scrubbing it in the tub--nothing. In the end, Manduka sent me a nice Manuka rag thing, for my hands to grip, and I have to use that when I do vinyasa. But I didn't want to pay that much for a rag: I wanted a reliable yoga mat.

Scrubbed it. Salted it. Let my cats bat at it. I sent all my energy and good vibes at it. Nothing. Based on other reviews, I'm not alone. It gets two stars because the customer service person at Manduka was super helpful. I'd give them another shot but not this particular product.",2.0
"I followed all of the instructions on how to break it in, I've been constantly practicing on it for a few months now, and its still super slippery!!! I'm not a sweaty person at all, and my feet and hands just slip away on it... I never had that problem before with any other mat! Practicing on it is a chore I make myself do since I spent so much money on it... And after all this time with no progress I just hate it. Even if at some point now it will change for the better, the overall experience with it is absolutely terrible for me. Only thing I like about it is the color, but that's the least of my concerns with a yoga mat and defiantly not worth the money and time I spent not enjoying my practice...",2.0
"I have seven Manduka mats and this one feels different. It's not as rigid as the others-- which have all had good use. This one feels like a 35 dollar 'excercise pad'. I am not sure if this is a knock off, but it sure feels like it. I'm only giving it two stars because of the length.
I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase as I have such a high standard for Manduka. I can't allow my students to use this because I'm afraid they will hurt themselves.",2.0
too slippery and it has a strong smell,2.0
This mat is so slippery that it is dangerous for me in Buti Yoga. Im slipping in poses and in transitions. I really wanted to like it and Ive given it several chances and tried salting it and scrubbing it with vinegar but still not change. I have a friend with the same mat that is having the exact issue as well. How is his rated so highly for non slip mats?!,2.0
"I was really excited to get this mat, sadly it hasn't lived up to expectations.

Pros: Thickness. Your knees and hip bones will be protected when you use this mat. Also, there are nice color choices.

Cons: Like other reviewers have noted, there is a film on the mat that needs to be ""worn"" off either through continual practice or through treating it with sea salt. Maybe if I was able to get the sticky, waxy film off the mat, it would love it, but I haven't been able to and the mat is nothing but disgusting. I live in a smallish NYC apartment with cats and don't have the luxury of letting my mat sit out in the sun covered in sea salt for a day, nor do I have an outdoor space to leave it as recommended. I tried scrubbing it with salt for a while then rinsing it but that didn't work. EVERYTHING sticks to the coating on this mat-- cat hair, human hair, dust, everything-- it feels like its coated in wax and has the most awful feeling to it. I have no problem with breaking/wearing things in, but this is gross. I've been practicing yoga for nearly 18 years and have never encountered a mat that feels so.... icky.

I think the coating on the mat becomes even more bothersome when you see the pricetag. For over $100, the mat should be usable right out of the package.",2.0
"Disappointed.  My hands slide.  Would return but past the ""return window"" by 3 days.",2.0
No one can seem to make a yoga mat that is truly slip proof except Jade. This is no exception. Hands slip all the time on this.,2.0

"This mat is soooooo slippery! even post salt bath overnight.  Maybe there's a better way to break it in, but so far I'm slipping and distracted during my hot yoga practice.  HALP!",2.0
"I am not a jock!  Just a 60ish woman in decent shape who has been taking Pilates for a few years.  My mat was getting old - so I decided to try this when it was featured on a 'daily deal' as the reviews were so good.  It is just not think enough or soft enough. I actually could not due some of the moves with this mat.  My bones hurt.  I definitely have a bit of extra padding myself so it is not that I am skin and bones. The mat is too heavy and bulky to mail back ( and I tossed the box) - so I now wrap it around my old ( thicker, softer, better) $30(!!) mat that I got from Dick's a few years ago.  Save your money!",2.0
"The mat itself was made of high quality material. I did not think that a mat that expensive should require ""Treating"" before using. This should be done at the factory so that you can use it immediately. I didn't want the hassle of buying sea salt and treating that was my reason for returning it.",2.0
"I used to borrow a friend's Manduka mat for yoga, and it was dense, grippy perfection. So when I got my own, I was surprised at how slippery it was at first. I followed instructions to wash it and hoped that a good break-in would solve the problem. Well, a few years later, after many, many yoga classes and regular maintenance to the mat, it STILL slips.
I finally got the Manduka towel to pair with it, and that makes it useable -- at least now my hands aren't slowly sliding out while in downward dog. Still, it's sad that I had to cough up even more money to make this already-expensive mat work like it's supposed to.

After reading other reviews, I'm convinced that there must be some issue with manufacturing. I KNOW that Manduka mats can be worth the money. I've used some that were. It just so happens that mine is not.",2.0
"Wish I could give a better review. Unfortunately, 5 months later, this mat is still slick and also turns into a slip and slide if any sweat drops on it.

"This is a very well made mat, with decent cushion for the thickness...however, it also happens to be the slipperiest non-slip yoga mat ever. I've tried salt, I've tried vinegar, I've practiced on it (almost) daily for several months, and yet my warrior ones inevitably turn into unplanned splits and my downward dogs migrate wider with every breath. After months of struggling with it, tonight I'd had enough and finished class on the floor. Anyone have any good mat recommendations?",2.0
"Instead, we had a miserable month-long tryst and then I returned it because it was still slippery as hell after putting in a TON of hard work trying to get the ""protective film"" off, and I don't have the patience to hate yoga for as long as you apparently have to in order to break it in.

I brought it home. I did the salt scrub. I used it 5-6x/week.

It was still slippery after a few weeks. So, I did the salt scrub again. And again. I used chemical sprays and homemade sprays and tried basically all of the suggestions that I could find in previous reviews for wearing it in. I even left the mat laying on the floor in my hallway in between uses and walked on it dozens of times throughout the day, hoping to get past the notorious slippery film that for some reason Manduka refuses to take off themselves. I ordered a yoga mat towel. No dice. Maybe the $60 mat towel would have worked better, but I had a real issue with having to spend $60 on a towel because my $80 mat sucks that bad.

Every yoga session with this mat was miserable. Instead of focusing on alignment or the poses or breathing, I spent every class feeling deep hatred for my mat and trying not to slip all over the place.

Maybe the protective film was extra thick on this one. I don't know. It's obviously a quality mat, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars. But, in the end I returned it and tried several others before settling on one from a company that starts with L and ends with ululemon and I feel wonderful about my decision. I feel stressed just thinking about my experiences with the Pro-Lite. It was not for me and honestly I'm a little resentful that Manduka doesn't fix this problem before they ship.",2.0
One drop of sweat turns this amazing mat into a slippery mess. You will need to find a good towel to put on top. With the right combination you will have a four star mat. For more $$$.,2.0
"I am very disappointed in the mat.  It varies between slippery and sticky.  I treated the mat with salt as per the directions.  My hands still slipped during my yoga practice.  I then cleaned the mat following the class.  After the cleaning, the mat became sticky.  My feet would stick to the mat and prohibit  movement during yoga and piyo classes.  My feet would actually lift the mat, so that I would be required to stop the class movements to straighten out the mat. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MAT.  IT IS NOT WORTH IT.  I HAD BETTER LUCK WITH MATS THAT I PURCHASED AT WALMART!",2.0
Super disappointed in this mat.  It's very nice and seems like good quality but it's so slippery. I about fell on my face because you can't hold a pose at all. I purchased this because I had been using a cheap crappy mat but honestly it was working better,2.0
"I used a friend's mat and I realized I should be expecting more out of my yoga mat. I started researching mats and Manduka kept popping up at the top of everyone's reviews. Also my yoga studio is a big advocate for Manduka. The PROlite is a little more travel friendly so I thought that would be perfect. I have been using the mat for about a month now (practicing ~3 times a week) and I am sooooo disappointed. It has poor wet AND dry traction. I was prepared for some amount of break-in period based on others' reviews, but I think I'm past that point and my mat is still a slip'n'slide. I did the salt scrub that was recommended by the manufacturer and I rub my sweaty body all over the mat during my practice to try to remove the ""manufacturing residue."" I noticed some improvement, but not enough to feel stable during vinyasa. I am going to try a rubber mat next as they are supposed to have better traction.",2.0
over rated and over priced.,2.0
"I am a regular yogi and do a lot power yoga. I decided to spring for a more expensive mat as I practice almost daily, and the lifetime guarantee got me. I just don't think this mat is that special. And for the price, I wanted something that feels great when I'm practicing. Hopefully it really will last a lifetime as I guess that could justify the price. But I wouldn't spend this much again on this mat.",2.0
"I want to love this mat so badly. However, I've had it for about 4 months now - and there is still so much slippage. Manduka's advice (in addition to the salt scrub, which I tried) is that it should get better over time, but I'm starting to wonder exactly how much.",2.0

"After ""treating"" myself to a Manduka Pro Extra Long mat, I have been so disappointed with this mat! It is so slippery, to the point of being dangerous. I have had this mat for seven months and use it 2-3 times a week, including two yoga retreats and I AM STILL SLIPPING. I read about the ""breaking-in"" and tried to be patient. I have put it in the sun. I have done the recommended salt scrubs- multiple times. I have spoken with Manduka on the phone twice. They just tell you that your ""sweat level"" must be high, and to try the salt scrub AGAIN. Or that I should use a towel on top of the mat. I'm sorry, but if I pay over $100 for a mat, I don't want to have to use a towel over it. They also said it could take a year for the slippery film to wear off!

I understand there is a breaking-in period, but this is ridiculous. Be forewarned, this is a very high-maintenance mat and you may not get regular use out of it until it is a year old. Such a shame, because it is a very nice length and thickness.",2.0
"After a month of solid use and several scrubbings with a bristle brush, this mat still is not sticky enough to hold a downward dog.  I am returning it.  I am giving it a star for the pretty color and it does seem to be a fairly sturdy mat.  If you are not planning to do yoga, it would probably work out just fine.",2.0
I really like the Manduka products however after reading lots of reviews I thought the PROlite would be a good fit but it was SO disappointing! It was extremely slippery and even after letting the mat air out over the weekend it still had a strong odor that stayed on my clothes and hair!  I got this mat because it had a good rating for a non slip grip well that wasn't the case! It was more slippery than the standard mat you can find in most retail stores! I was really disappointed with the quality of this product!,2.0
"I am very disappointed with this manduka yoga mat. The reviews were good and it was even ranked high on a yoga blog. I do not practice hot yoga and do not have sweaty hands or feet. But, I slide on this mat during poses downward dog. The directions for the mat stated to place sea salt all over the mat for 24 hours and then wipe with a wet cloth. I followed these directions and still slip. I hope it gets better with time. My friend, who practices hot tough, told me to buy the luluemon mat because it does not slip at all. I wish I went with her advice. I do like the thickness and support the mat gives my knees when balacing.",2.0
The mat is nice but its adversed as non slippery and its clearly not. It is slippery and likely will require that you purchase a yoga blanket to set on top of it. I don't recommend purchasing this or at least go and inspect one before you buy it. I tried to return it and once it was shipped Manduka Matsource LLC said that they have a no return policy so caveat emptor.,2.0
Bought this for our 7 year old who has long thick hair. Reviews said it would fit a youth but it's too big for her.  She lost 2 matches because it kept sliding down over her eyes and distracting her.  Very disappointed.  And this description says one size fits most.  Beware that the label actually says its size is ADULT.,2.0
"If you sweat buckets this is not the mat for you. Get something else. Don't waste your time trying to convince yourself it may work. It won't.  I did the sun, sea salt scrub down ritual and even gave a little hope that it would magically be different than all the others. It was not.

If you want to chop wood, you buy an axe, not a pocket knife.  Sure you can cut wood with a pocket knife but you'd be better off sticking that pocket knife in you eye and saving yourself some torment and frustration. The same goes for this mat. It is not a mat for sweaty people. period. All of us that have been disappointed in this mat are simply buying it expecting it to be different and having to change it to meet our demands. Manduka is partly to blame due to the marketing that is put behind the mat. It should not be marketed as a mat that stays sticky during sweaty yoga sessions. That is simply not accurate. Perhaps if you put a towel over it you don't slip but then that's the towel doing the work, not the mat, and we all know that is not the same.

Bottom Line: If you sweat a lot (dripping sweat) and don't want to practice on a towel. Save yourself the frustration and try another.",2.0
"As a die hard yoga person, I love the mat but it came with indentations along one side that I haven't been able to get out.  Like it had leaned up against something too long.  I thought after using it for a time they would go away naturally but they haven't.  Luckily it's at the end not in the middle of mat, it's just always in view.  Otherwise it has great grip factor, did NOT smell but was a bit sticky.  I washed with warm salt water and that resolved as company suggested.  The color and lightness is GREAT.  I'll contact the company with pictures now that I realize it's more defective and see what they recommend.",2.0

"Too slippery!  Like a slip n' slide especially when wet.  Admittedly, mine is brand new but I don't see the necessity of breaking in a yoga mat.

"I have been doing yoga going on 4 years now 2-3x's a week.  I have bought a few other cheaper mats that don't hold up very well.  I purchased this mat because I heard that I will not slide on it when I sweat.  That's simply not true!!  I wipe this mat down regularly and thought once my body oils got into the mat, the oils would  help the mat get sticky so I do not slide.  That has not been the case!!!  The mat is well made and heavy but I didn't buy it for that reason.  I spent a lot of money on this mat because it claimed you would not slip once it was worn in!!!  Well,  its worn in and I still slip and slide!!!  I have to have a large towel handy or I am unable to use this mat.  They should not have made the claim that you will not slide once you sweat on it.  A Big Expensive Disappointment!!!  I would never have spent $90 on this if I had known beforehand!!!!",2.0
"This mat is probably great for people who don't sweat much. I thought I was ordering the eko because of the high reviews of this mat. It's fine for a pretty basic practice but when playing with drop-backs, handstands and even something as basic as wheel, it's pretty scary when your feet slip out from under you and the next thing to hit is your head. I don't hate it after ""breaking it in"" but I still wish it provided more grip for an intense practice. I wouldn't dare try it in a heated room..",2.0
"I was very excited about purchasing this mat.  When it arrived, I tried it out, and the second it got wet, it was REALLY slippery.

I read online that the ""film"" can be taken off with salt, and that the ""break in is worth it"", but who wants to go through that after paying that price? This is my first time writing a product review, I wish I would have known before I bought this mat.  In the end, I got another Jade Mat.  I'm very happy with it.",2.0
Heavy duty with great padding but super slippery.  Rubbed it down with salt & let it sit in the sun several times but couldn't get rid of the slippery film on top of the mat forcing me to return it.,2.0
I heard such great things about this brand but it has taken over a year for the sheen to wear off. I still find my hands slip. Their website has a page dedicated to this issue if that tells you anything.,2.0
"I just used this for the first time & it is so slippery!! Uncomfortably, dangerously slippery! My yoga instructor suggested washing it on gentle w a small amount of soap. I did but it still feels slippery. I have always used fairly inexpensive mats & i have never had this problem. It's too bad because the mat is nice otherwise.",2.0
"I read a number of reviews before purchasing this mat.  I knew to expect a little slippage while breaking in the Manduka Black Mat Pro.  What I didn't expect was the degree of slipperiness I experienced with this mat.

What I Liked:
- 85 Inch length and generous width
- Weight...yes, the weight.  So many reviews listed the weight as a negative.  I liked the stability it provided.  If you can't lug around a 9lb mat, you are certainly going to be challenged with many yoga sessions being taught.
- Easy to keep clean (the slippery surface doesn't attract dirt!)

What I Couldn't Live With:
- THE SLIPPERINESS...period.  When I showed it off to a fellow yoga enthusiast, she said that she had ordered the same mat, and finally returned it for a Jade Harmony.  I replied, ""yes, but you just have to rub some sea salt on it, and use it a little, and it will break in just fine."" I was also thinking ""and let it dry in the sun, rub it with steel wool, get over it because if you use your core like you should, the slippery surface won't matter, use dish detergent to break down the factory film...""  And the list goes on.

What I Did (Bought a Jade Fusion):
I read more reviews and found that many people were never able to ""break in"" their Manduka Black Mat Pros, while to be fair, others seem to love theirs.  There are whole blogs on the subject.  So, I sent it back and ordered a Jade Fusion 74"".  This mat is wonderful.  It is sticky, sturdy, easy on the knees, and in my opinion, a much better choice (at least for me) than the Manduka Black Mat Pro.  I'll write a separate review on my Jade, but I am a now a loyal Jade fan and don't see ever buying another brand...unless of course someone produces an 85"" x 5/16"" mat made from natural rubber.  I wish Jade had an option for a slightly larger Fusion, but in the meantime, I LOVE MY JADE FUSION.",2.0
"Pros: thick and cushy, lovely colors, easy to clean, eco friendly.

Cons: mat surface pattern causes poor grip especially with sweaty hands. Small chunks of material began flaking off with six months of once or twice weekly usage. Grippy only with a damp towel over, which defeats the point of a non slip mat.

I purchased my PROLite mat almost a year ago because of the glowing Amazon reviews and followed Manduka's break in instructions to the letter (other than the sea salt thing. Couldn't see how destroying the mat's surface would make it grippier!). It's always been a bit slippery but as I don't sweat a lot, I attributed this to its newness and my inexperience. With months of improved technique, the mat is only slightly less slippery. Hot yoga and vinyasa are equally treacherous with this mat.

I finally got tired of wrenching my shoulder girdle in down dog and purchased a Jade Harmony mat. Had my first session with the Jade yesterday and found that it's not only truly sticky, but the surface pattern renders excellent grip. I got rid of my PROLite immediately and I'm not going back. Don't waste your money like I did!",2.0
"matt thickness is great as is the look and feel of it. Unfortunately they are coated with some resin that makes is very slippery.

i left it lying in the entrance of my apartment for 4 days and it made it a bit better but still not perfect.",2.0
"I wanted to love this mat but it's barely usable!  I loved the deep purple color and there was no overwhelming ""new"" mat smell.  The mat is thick but it's so dense that it doesn't provide much cushioning.  That was slightly frustrating.  The most frustrating thing is that I've had this mat since December 2014 and I still slip and slide everywhere.  I have at times a vigorous practice and have been practicing for 4+ years, but I would be sliding everywhere even when I was just warming up at home.  I can't even stay in down dog for a second without my hands sliding forward.  Using this mat in a class in the studio was definitely frustrating.  I would become embarrassed and distracted and couldn't perform poses correctly.  I know it takes time to break in, and I washed using the manufacturers specifications, but even then I slide.  I thought maybe it was the oils on my hands, but even washing and drying my hands thoroughly before practicing did not help.  I am very disappointed given the amazing reviews.  I know many people who love this brand, but I just can't use Manduka anymore.  They seem like a great company, but they just don't jive with what I need in a mat.  I had to give this to my husband.  He didn't slide but prefers his $20 mat from Target.  Go figure!",2.0
Returned because of slipping. I have an old Manduka mat that I love and is not slippery. I purchased this to keep one at home and one in the car but this one is too slippery for me. I bought a Jade mat for my partner and she loves it. I may go with that as my next choice.,2.0
"The word (Teal) has been added in the last 24 hrs.  The picture of the black yoga mat is deceiving because, apparently, the word 'Black' is a model name, not a color and the word 'Quest' just so you know, means 'Blue', even though the picture is of a Black yoga mat.  I had to contact Amazon to see about a return, the seller has yet to send me the return label.  So I'm not too happy right now.  I'm sure the yoga mat is fine, but the seller I'm not to keen on right now.  Where's my return label?  I'll give a better rating if I ever get my return label.  $100 is not a cheap yoga mat.",2.0
"I purchased this mat based on the excellent reviews.  As soon as I got it, I took it out and tried a 'downward dog' pose. My hands slipped, so I sent it back.  Didn't work for me.  But it appears to be a very high quality (although also quite heavy) mat.",2.0
should have bought it at REI for less money,2.0
"You pay extra b/c it's supposed to be non slip and more comfortable, but it's actually neither of those things.",2.0
"Although I know from friends and yoga teachers that this mat is superior, it was too heavy for me and a bit slippery so I exchanged it for a Jade Harmony brand mat and it is perfect for me.  Lighter weight and super grippy. No more sliding in downward dog!!  Yay!",2.0
Not worth your money...water in my daughters ears immediately! Looks great though! Save your money if you are looking for a cap to keep water out of ears,2.0
"as a 3-4 times a week swimmer, I wanted to protect my hair from further damages.
I love the design, but the cap slides up, and after 3 -4 laps finally off.
My hair still gets wet, and the cap needs to be pulled down every other lap - quite annoying.

And all of that with a regular, not big head size.....",2.0
"Jade Yoga has a much better mat.
This is OK",2.0
"So, this mat is great quality in many ways, BUT, it has remained very slippery.  It is, in fact, the most slippery mat I have owned.

I'm changing my review and writing this several months on after initially buying into the bit about ""the factory coating"".  I took their word for it that it would texturize over time, thereby becoming less slippery.

Sadly, I am now starting to believe this is just what the company says to explain away an obvious defect.  It's kinda' the perfect strategy.  It certainly seems to discredit a lot of negative reviews by implying that either the user doesn't practice enough  to break it in (oh, snap! yoga shade!), or the reviewer is just not ""in the know"" about how to prepare it in the right way (double yoga shade!).

Let me tell you, I've scrubbed it with salt, used it regularly for months, scrubbed it with a gosh darn brillo pad, soaked it in the sun, soaked it in vinegar, soaked it in the sun and vinegar, and the mat is still the slippiest mat there ever was.

As I said, I bet this thing will last forever in its infinite slippy-ness because in every other way it's great quality.  In other words, it's going to hang around and torment me for years to come because I'm too eco-neurotic to throw out a mat that is still in useable condition, technically speaking.",2.0
"I purchased two of these mats for my wife and I because of all the ""great"" reviews.  Unfortunately we were both disappointed.  These mats are very expensive, very heavy, very slippery even with simple poses with minimal palm sweat.  However, to be fair, the construction quality, foam quality, and padding thickness is great.  With that said, I am going to return these and go with a different product.",2.0
Too slippery.,2.0
"I am really hoping this mat will be a good long term investment because it has a lifetime warranty. I bought this this mat for my husband because of the size and thickness, he has a tendency to wear through mats too quickly. Unfortunately even after weeks of practice and salt scrubs per the instructions it is quite slippery. He even inqured his wrists. If you sweat at all during your practice it could be a potential issue due to the closed cells. Just plan on needing a towel.",2.0
"It's ok, I've had mats in great past that weren't that thick but then again it didn't cost me $90. 00.  It smells really strong of rubber,  kinda like the smell you get when you brake really hard with your car tires. I expected a more comfortable cushion that wouldn't cause discomfort with my tailbone but words around that it's a given no matter how thick your mat is. It's heavy and my fingers slip when I'm sweating or when my Palms are sweaty. This mat is nothing special I will not buy from this company Again.",2.0
Its too slippery! I scrubbed it with sea salt but it doesnt work! Plus it looks very cheap. Definitly not worth the money!!!,2.0
"I had high hopes for this one and gave it  a few weeks to break in. Scrubbed it with sea salt etc. etc. I do like the thickness but as soon as I started sweating a little, it became incredibly slippery. Will keep looking for the perfect yoga mat.",2.0
"This mat is very slippery to the point that it begins to feel unsafe.  I feel insecure thinking my hands or feet will slip and I will fall.  I heard this was the best mat for Yoga, but for me, this is not the case.  Very  disappointing.",2.0
I disappointed in this mat. It is very sticky/slippery and my hands and feet slip and make it very difficult to use this mat. I tried cleaning as the directions said to do but still the mat is very slippery. It is as though they put a layer of oil on the mat that won't come off. Very sorry I purchased this mat. I will go back to the Jade mat that I love.,2.0
"If you want for personal use, great, but otherwise like carrying a lead weight.  Seems ok otherwise, very expensive too",2.0
"I had purchased this mat as reward for having endured crappy/cheap yoga mats for years. So, I bought this one thinking I would be the happiest person ever. Nope. I have the same problems with this mat as I do with all mats. When you sweat you slide- you slide really bad actually. I have had this mat for almost three months now and it shows no sign of wearing in and isn't responding to the Manduka recommend ed break-in treatments. The color is nice- but this mat is not worth the price. Very,very  disappointed.",2.0
"I did a lot of research looking for a super grippy yoga mat, and this one came highly recommended. However, it isn't grippy at all. After several months of having to practice with a yoga towel, I finally went ahead and got a Lululemon one, which is fantastic.",2.0
"The thickness and texture of the mat is just fabulous which makes this review kind of bittersweet.  Basically after 6 months of using this mat, it is still too slippery for me to enjoy a practice with (~3-4 sessions, 60-75min).  If I am not sweating at all, the mat is sufficient but any moisture at all and it because a train wreck for me.  I tried adding a towel but the Manduka one might even compound the situation unless I'm sweating heavily, i don't like spraying it down before.

So there you have it.  I'll be looking for another mat soon.  So sad because with any different texture on the surface might have made this one perfect for me.",2.0
still quite slippery.  won't tighten up. i'll give a few more weeks to see. wash it with sea salt like it indicates in the directions. but still slippery. i thought this was supposed to be the better of most. my $30 mat is better,2.0
"I think I've had this for 4 months now, use it 2-3xs/week and I am still sliding on it. I love the regular heavy manduka pro, but it is quite heavy so I leave it at the other studio that I teach for, and use this one to carry with me. Not worth it. I should have just purchased another heavy manduka pro. There's no reason to spend upwards of $50 or $60 because this quality is more like a $30 mat.",2.0
"This mat is very slippery even when slightly damp.  In the dry it's fantastic but if you are in a warm climate as I am, then the slipping and sliding starts after about 30 minutes.

I experienced the same problem on a similar purchase (the Pro Lite) but even after contacting customer service and following their advice  there was no improvement.

If you mainly engage in restorative yoga, pilates and stretching this is a great mat.  For anything else, look at the Jade Yoga selection.  These mats only last about two years. However, they are not slippers.",2.0
"I don't  understand  why  this  expensive  mat  is  slippery which  makes  me really  not  like  it. I  read  reviews  to  find  out  how  you  can  make  it  not  slip. I  laid it out outside  to  get an  afternoon sun. I  have  used it about 2 weeks  and  still  slippery. I  used  towel  for  my  hands which  help a  bit.  On  the  warrior  stance,  my  feet would  slip.  So, I'm  still  waiting  for  it  to  work  for  me.  If I  had  known  this  was a  major  problem I  would  have  gone  to  Jade  Harmony or  Lululemon.  The  only  reason I  gave 2  stars  is  that  it  seems  solid  and  study  which  will  last long with a  lifetime  warranty.",2.0
Beautiful color but hazardously slippery. It is so disappointing to have expectations raised and then discover that this mat serves less well than the yucky mats the yoga studios generally provide.,2.0
Your hands slide when you do downward dog. It's nice & thick but it does no good when you keep sliding.,2.0
"I hate to sound negative but this mat is not what I expect.  I already have a Hugger Mugger rubber mat which give very good grip.  I order a Manduka because of the name, and understand the pro lite is lighter for traveling.  This mat is not giving half of the grip that Hugger Mugger has.  I practice yoga 6 times and pilate 3 time every week.  I found the Hugger Mugger more dependable.  Though it does not roll up as easy as the Manduka, I am going back to the Hugger Mugger rubber mat.",2.0
"I should've checked this out in a store before purchasing.  I ended up selling it on Craigslist and buying a softer one.
The mat is just too HARD for my taste.  I've been doing yoga for 30+ years (I'm 51) and my body needs a thick, cushy mat.  I bought a slightly cheaper (thicker) Manduka mat that is working just fine.",2.0
"Ordered because of the Manduka reputation and the bright color. The mat IS NOT slip resistant upon arrival so I followed the directions to sprinkle sea salt on the top surface of the mat, dampen with a cloth, and scrub it with a stiff scrub brush. Used the mat in approximately twenty-four Power Vinyasa 90 min classes but never felt stable in adho mukha shvanasana --hands and feet kept slipping. Very frustrating! Resorted to using my old Jade mat - slip resistant upon arrival although perhaps not as long lasting. Regardless, a practitioner should not have to break in a $80 yoga mat. Returned the Manduka for another Jade.",2.0
"Since I teach yoga, I'm on the go from studio to studio. This mat was simply too heavy to lug around.

Plus, after several weeks of daily use, it still hadn't ""broken in"", and was quite slippery. I tried the salt scrub & everything.

I found a cheap-o closed-cell foam mat from Nike at the thrift store for $4.99. It's super light weight & much stickier than this Manduka. A bummer, since I heard such great things about it. If I need extra cushioning for my knees during low lunges, I simply use a blanket.

Many people say this is a great mat, so just Buyer Beware for your own personal needs, I guess...",2.0
"I wish I had read the reviews here, because all I did was research ""best yoga mat"" and everyone raved about Manduka.  When I found it cheaper on Amazon, I just ordered it off the bat without reading further.

The mat itself feels great, it is thick and very durable, and at first when I started to use it I thought it was going to be really great.  Then we got into the flowy part of class and I warmed up (I don't sweat much at all), and suddenly my legs were sliding apart and I was almost in the splits doing triangle.  Not good.

I'm really disappointed and I hope they take it back.  It would be perfect if it weren't slippery.  And there is no way we should have to scrub and ""break in"" a yoga mat for three months, as the manufacturer suggests.  That is bizarre marketing if you ask me.  How 'bout they do all that before putting it out for sale?!",2.0
"Search online and you'll find a lot of discussion on how this $85 mat is slippery.  A yoga mat needs to do 2 things:  prevent you from sliding and cushion your body.  This mat is slippery and makes it difficult to maintain poses.  I searched Manduka's website and found some remedies.  One remedy is to buy their mat renew product which is outrageously priced at over $30 a bottle.  The other was to scrub it with sea salt and let it dry in the sun.  I had to step back for a moment:  why am I having to figure out how to get a brand new premium yoga mat to work ?  The absurdity of a yoga mat being slippery right out of the box and me having to research how to get it to function properly really struck me.

The Manduka FAQs say to use it for 3 months then it will become less slippery.  They also say to ""keep your energy towards your center of gravity"" as a method to prevent slipping.  Last, they say ""slipping can be handy for some poses"".  While there is some truth to these claims the 3 month break-in is silly and the rest could be interpreted as excuses for a mat poorly made.

The thing I like about the mat is it's appearance (color really).  Sometimes I like to leave the mat unrolled in the house and find the green/purple/blue one's ugly.  Because of its neutral brown color this mat has better aesthetics.

I haven't done a lot of kneeling poses on it but it does seem like it provides better padding than many of the cheaper mats because it is thicker.",2.0
"this mat is soooo overrated.  i love the thickness, but it's super heavy and bulky to carry around.  it also is extremely slippery.  i get very frustrated when i have to use the 'dookie'.",2.0
"The length is amazing on this mat as is the thickness of it but after all that there is nothing positive i can possibly say about it!!

I also bought the matching MatWare Sleeve which i had to return since i ended up sending this back as well.

I tried everything i read and heard about trying to ""break in"" a mat and to make it stop being slippery but nothing worked on this mat!!

Extremely disappointed i am just glad that i was able to return it and get a refund before i broke or cracked a bone or something!!

I would never buy again nor would i recommend it.",2.0
"My wife bought this mat and she thinks it is too slippery.  Her yoga instructor told her to wash it to give it more traction.  She has washed it twice, scrubbing it vigorously with a brush, and it is still slippery.  Maybe we can use it as a sled.",2.0
"In many ways this is a nice yoga mat.  It is built from a sturdy rubber.  You can tell it won't disintegrate over time like most of my mats have.  It has a nice weight and thickness providing good cushioning from any hard floor without being too spongy or floaty.

But my main reason for buying this mat was to reduce or eliminate slippage due to sweat.  I generally do a pretty hardcore yoga session for about 1.5 hours and produce a decent amount of sweat.  My hands and feet get sweaty and sweat drips off my torso onto the mat.  My cheapo Target yoga mat is decent.  It has a porous foam base to it and the sweat gets absorbed away from the surface.

The Manduka is clearly a closed pore rubber.  There's no where for the sweat to go.  It sits on top of the mat.  And thus, no surprise, it's incredibly slippery.  Ice skating rink slippery.  I simply cannot hold moves and I have almost slipped and fallen as I was prepping for the starts of moves. It's a complete non-starter.  Clearly others have run into this problem (just check out the 1 and 2 star reviews) but you also see it in some of the 5 star reviews if you look closely.  One lady who gave the mat 5 stars admitted it was slippery but rationalized that it would make the yoga workout that much better.

But what really annoys me about this mat is the 'break-in' instructions.  The mat, once shipped, needs to be cleaned of a film on the mat.  The company has some instructions on their site and other people have commented on various techniques they've used.  I followed the company's instruction.  FIVE times.  To no avail.  But I have to ask.  When I'm spending over $100 on a piece of rubber, why on earth am i, a Manduka mat novice, being asked to perform what obviously seems like a hit or miss break-in procedure of the mat?  Why isn't the company doing this?  The mat presumably lasts forever so what special property does this film have? It makes no sense.  The company even sells a cleaning fluid.  How about you just clean your mat before sending it to your customers.  Doesn't that make sense?

At any rate.  This is going back.",2.0
"I bought this mat because it had excellent reviews and it is supposed to last a lifetime.  At the beginning of my practice it does stick quite well but after only about 5 to 10 minutes my hands and feet have begun sweating and it doesn't stick at all.  It was not an exaggeration in the other review that it's like practicing on ice.  I have done 6 practices on it and cleaned it twice with no improvement.  So, if you're the kind of person that doesn't sweat then this mat will probably be great but if, like me, you sweat quite a bit then you will be better off with a $20 mat you can find at Target.",2.0
"I am still frustrated by how slippery my mat continues to be after 16 months of regular practice. I have cleaned it, let it set in the sun, cleaned it a different way, let it get sweaty, cleaned it yet another way. It is still slippery when I sweat a bit. I continue to be disappointed. Not worth the $90 I paid, even if it does last a lifetime.",2.0

"I recently started getting into yoga, and decided that I wanted to drop all the middle-of-the-road stuff and jump right to the high-end product.  I was also very interested in getting a thicker mat for my knees.

I think that for the average yoga practitioner, this product would be just fine.  My hands, however, sweat a little more than the average person and doing Adho Mukha Svanasana made me slip in a way that could only be characterized as dangerous.

The manufacturer recommended that I rub the mat down with sea salt, which I did many times.  I also used mild detergent scrubs and even left it in the sun for several hot days to degrade the ""film"" that comes as a ""part of the manufacturing process.""  Still no dice.

The last time that I called the manufacturer, they mentioned that Manduka mats use a ""closed cell"" technology which keeps water out of the mat (mitigating the need for periodic cleaning) but necessarily keeps water on the surface of mat. Translation: sweat stays between your hands and the mat.  Sliiiiiiiip....

The recommendation of Manduka is to buy one of their towels to rest on the mat, but my yoga instructor tells me that the towels shift and move when hopping into uttanasana from high chaturanga, a very common vinyasa transition.  Yikes!  That's a lot of trouble and uncertainty for now investing close to $130 into mats and towels.  (Not to mention that you now have to carry around 2 items, not just one.)  I recognize that a mat that has an open cell system will require periodic washing, but it also means that my back won't give out doing what should be a fairly simple pose.

I purchased the Jade Yoga Fusion mat just last week, and after only scrubbing it once, it is perfect.

I hope that this helps!  Yoga has been a great addition to my life, and now having the mat issue figured out, the sky's the limit!",2.0
"Hate to give this 2 stars unfortunately, here's why... It's the most slippery mat I've ever done yoga on. As nice as it is otherwise, this makes it almost completely unusable!

After quitting smoking and getting better and more regular at yoga classes, I decided to treat myself to a fancy new mat... the old one was a little slippery (a 20 $ Tapas)... got the black mat, boy was I disappointed! the rubber, though very firm and comfortable for knees, smells terrible for weeks besides the slipping (if your palms sweat even slightly). Instructions talk about some kind of invisible film you have to scrub off or give a few months to break in. I scrubbed it down 3 times without seeing any difference. Keep in mind too that after scrubbing a product, what if you realize you want to return it?!

Buy this mat only if you plan to buy a towel to put over it (to avoid slipping) and are ok with spending the $$ on what you could have for much less. A particularly embarrassing time in yoga class, after noticing what a hard time I was having holding down dog, the instructor gave me her tattered '$26' mat and I made it through class much better.

Final thought... if not for the slipping and scrubbing down issues... this mat would get 5 stars for comfort and not flapping around as you jumper step. Happy shopping!",2.0
"Slippery!!! Be careful!!!
I'm a Asthanga Vidyasa Yoga practicer and I sweat a lot during every practice. I bought the ""manduka blackmat pro"" to try ""the TajMahal of yoga mats"" thinking that it would be wonderful to practice with it. Unhappily, it's impossible to have a sweating practice because it slips a lot!! More than a regular mat.  Do not buy it if you sweat! I'm so disappointed that I will return it.",2.0
"Well-reviewed, used by my teachers and more experienced fellow students, well-cushioned, generously sized, but sadly, I have returned it.  It is most definitely not for someone who sweats as prodigiously as I.",2.0
"I've had this mat for 2+ years and agree with the previous reviews. This mat is not sweat-friendly, particularly if you practice vinyasa. And, once sweat absorbs in the mat, the odor starts brewing (even if you do clean with the special yoga mat cleaner, herbal concoctions or whatever else).

For profuse sweaters with a regular practice, this mat is not for you. For those who dare take an inversion with the Manduka, be sure to put a towel under your hands and/or wipe off your mat before moving into position.

On a positive note, this mat does offer more cushioning for the knees (but is by no means as plush as a Tapas Ultra...not suggesting you buy this either because it falls apart). Oh and the Manduka holds up under toe-digging, which is another plus.

Namaste!",2.0
"I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping, since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet. I was in for a big disappointment.  For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats, I was very disappointed.  Lesson learned, find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line.

For those of you who sweats alot, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT.",2.0
"I bought this mat because it was supposed to last a lifetime (or two). This is false. I used the mat for only 6 months 5 times a week to practice ashtanga and the surface started to peel off like the others mat I used before (but this one costs twice as much).

The purplelite is much heavier than a regular mat too, so realistically this is not a traveling mat. The ""lite"" in the name is just because it is lighter than the black mat.

However I still think this mat is superior to the 20 dollars mats",2.0
"I purchased the Manduka black pro mat a couple months ago and have practiced/taught at least 100+ hours (primarily vinyasa flow) with the mat.  I have naturally clammy, sweaty, moist hands at all times and I was hoping the Manduka would be a good solution to the constant slippage.  Unfortunately after breaking it in and using the Vermont organic mat wash (recommended by Manduka) my hands still slip a lot and require a towel or yogitoes at all times.  Evidentally, I'm purchasing the Jade Harmony mat as a replacement.  I compared the Jade and Manduka side by side and my hands didn't slip as much on the Jade due to the spongy texture which grips better.  Plus the Jade is all natural and biodegrades.

Manduka Pros: great cushion, mat stays in place, dries quickly after being washed, good size
Manduka Cons: sweaty hands slip easy, not environmentally friendly, 7 lb weight if using as a travel mat",2.0

My rating of the product reflects my frustration with the 45 minutes I spent getting the line from a loop onto my reel.  There may be a straight forward way to manage this process but after spending a considerable amount of time successfully tying a nail knot I was not happy with the huge birds nest I built. Yesssss I'm a fly fishing newbie. I'm soooo looking forward to leaders, tippets and flies and, of course, casting.",2.0
"Quality and design are perfect however size is wrong. I'm waist 36 and I ordered Size L, but It looks like a S. I will return.",2.0
The pants got wet after a 30 min playing in the snow. Would'n recommend this product.,2.0
Wrong order on my part; suppose to order adult size but somehow chose a youth one,2.0
Way too small. Seems well made but not helpful if you can't wear it!,2.0
"The quality of the pants are really nice however since there was no size sheet included, I had to go based off of comments and it still came in way too small. I am 5'4"" and I  ordered a large and the pants just barely reached my ankles to give you a little perspective on the pants. Now I'm stuck with a pair of snow pants that are too small on me and I have no idea what to do with them.",2.0
"If you are grown up women thinking of buying this because you are short, you better not. It was too tight for my hips and upper thighs.",2.0
"The quality of these seem ok with one exception. There is absolutely NO stretch in the waistband. Ive tried 2 sizes and neither one fit my daughters waist. Shes 7 and absolutely cannot fasten these on her own, as there is 0 give in the material.  Disappointed and will be returning.",2.0
"The pants are great quality material, however the sizing is not great at all. I am 50 and 114 lbs pretty tiny person. I ordered a size M and they fit well around the waste but wow are they short!! The reviews about the sizing is real.

I even followed the sizing charts that other consumers posted pictures of and still didn't work out. Pretty disappointed actually. This company really needs to figure it out. Hey, I guess you really do get what you pay for in life right?",2.0
Snap was already broken upon receiving pants in the mail. :-( TERRIBLE QUALITY.,2.0
too big for my 6 years old boy ...returned.,2.0
"I ordered these in bib form in a size S, but they were to small on my size 7/8 daughter. So I ordered these in a M and they were still too small. The buttons were also hard to snap. Wont be ordering from this brand anymore. Sizing definitely needs work.",2.0
"i'm 5'8 and 163 lbs, I got a medium as their chart states  a medium has a 30 inch waist. I got these pants today and they don't even go past my thighs, their medium is literally an extra small sized for dwarfs",2.0
Was WAY too small and had to return. The quality seemed fairly decent though.,2.0
Torn edges after one day of use. Too large of a fit.,2.0
Bought a large for my 11 yr son.  It was too small.  Returned it.  Bought a XL.  Still too small.,2.0
"I ordered a medium(10-12) size for my 10 year old daughter, she is pretty tall and weigh 88 lbs, but this pants is huge on her.",2.0
Too large for the age indicated. Have to return them.,2.0
Runs small.,2.0
These arrived with a slice in the butt area. Obviously quality control didn't do a good job of handling this without a knife or box cutter. Not happy when I needed these for a MT Hood trip the coming weekend.,2.0
way too big for my lean 9 year old ...I'll have to return (despite sizing chart which is misleading).  This almost looks like adult sizes. Be careful!,2.0
The sizing is wrong.  This is definitely sized for adults,2.0
Size doesn't fit as advertised :(,2.0
"These are not water resistant or waterproof.  They offer some wind protection, but my daughter wore fleece leggings and was still cold on a 34 day.  Was not what I expected.",2.0

"seemed very sturdy, however ripped in the crotch after just 2 uses.",2.0
"I don't ski nor snowboard. I purchased this item to keep me warm and dry when walking my dog in the snow. Yes we do have a lot snow in winter.
I am not really uning this pants for which it is designed for. This is why I was surprised to find the stitching on the inseam ripped for about 3 inches long.",2.0
I am a little disappointed in the mailbox. It flips over too easily.,2.0
"The color say fuschia however, it is a bubble gum pink. Fuschia for the color description of these pants is misleading",2.0
wrong size,2.0
"** I bought these a year ago however in our area it rarely snows so my son has only worn them three times and I just found a rip in the bottom ankle area of one of the pants legs .  Until this happened I had marked them with a five star review and actually bought myself a pair after being so pleased with the quality of his. However now I must come back and change my review .  For this price if you're like us and it snows rarely and your kids going to wear them once or twice a year it may be worth it to have some semi waterproof protection however I'm very disappointed that they are ripped on the bottom  after only a few wears.

After purchasing a smaller size that was unexpectedly too small for my 10-year-old the company was gracious enough to let me exchange them for these which fit perfect! They are a little small and a little snug so once we realize that it went up a size they fit my son perfect and kept him warm and dry during our most recent snowstorm.

Instead of having to come in and change out of wet pants and cycle them through our clothes dryer to dry them off, he played all day with these and never got wet! I love the bright colors it makes it easier for me to find him a boxed other children and they're nice and long for his tall legs. I would recommend these again it's a great quality product especially for the price, shipping was fast.

NOT GREAT,2.0
"While the pants are waterproof and  protective, and they were the right length, the waist is so large that my child ended up 'standing in them' rather than wearing them. When we pulled the waist in with the elastic, it was uncomfortable for her.",2.0
Got the size small after returning the ridiculously huge mediums.  These were also way too big in the waist but the length barely made it.  My daughter wears a size 12 slim pant.  Had to return these as well and go with a different brand.,2.0
"These will work fine if you're hiking pretty fast or it's windy and it's cool and you're standing up straight.  If you're sweating (which these will made you do if it's not windy), or bending over to work in the garden, etc, and staying in one place, FORGET IT.  When the netting contacts your skin for several seconds, mosquitos will bite you.  The netting contacts your skin when pulled against it by the position of your legs, enabling mosquitos to insert their proboscis right through.  I found this is worse when you're sweating.

If there's no strong breeze, it's cooler to wear jeans than these, and I've never had a mosquito bite me through jeans.  And my jeans don't require hand washing.

The only thing these are good for is shocking the neighbors.",2.0
"Too sloppy to wear, although I didn't get bit.",2.0
"Order larger because bugs can still bite your through the mesh and you don't want the mesh sticking to your skin!  Learned this the hard way.  You must wear a brimmed hat under the hood because the face mask will suffocate you!  Good in theory, but not so much in practice unless maybe you're allergic to butterflies. Everything else can still sting through.  I ordered both pieces of this suit (pants & top) and if you're wearing it in the summer it makes you extremely hot.  Heat attracts mosquitos. Convinced that Deep Woods Off with DEET is still the only way to keep the bugs away if you want to go outside in the summer!",2.0
"wayyyyyy too big...too wide and long
The sizes are for over the clothes.
I wish I had followed the instructions, but it didn't say that the sizes were for OVER the clothes.  I took a chance :/

6 foot, average weight",2.0
I had to return it ... I got the small one but it was still HUGE and not practical...,2.0
"Runs very large -- Oddly enough, the medium seemed smaller than the small....
Note that mosquitoes can bite through the mesh if it is lying on your skin -- also not a lot of help if you hate hearing or seeing the mosquitoes landing on you. Go for the Off Botanicals or the DEET if the mosquitoes are fierce.",2.0
"I'm not sure how these will hold up to cold weather and snow. I will update after my daughter has tried them out. For  now, they are just rather large.  Seems like the sizing is closer to adult than youth.  She's a skinny and tall girl for 10 yet, we have to roll them up and use suspenders to make them work.",2.0
"they work, but its very hot to wear, it will make you sweat.",2.0
One base ripped the first week and they are only tballers.,2.0
"it may provide some protection, but very uncomfortable as it does not breath well",2.0
These XS pants look great and like they'd be warm for an 8-9 year old!! Only issue is their size chart said XS was size 6. They are ridiculously big - they come up to her neck!!! I really regret this purchase and international shipping. :(,2.0
the product is awesome but none of the sizes fit my 10 and half year child. How have they designed it is beyond comprehension ...sad,2.0
Makes me sweat! Not very breathable.,2.0
"I bought a large for my daughter is is on the large side of 10/12 but the larges were way too large so I had to return them for a med which are a tad bit snug.
My other problem with these are they are not water resistant, first day playing out doors and my daughter is soaked when i picked her up from school.  The only reason I bought these is because I thought they would keep her more dry than some cheap ones from walmart or target.  I am no happy with them at all.  Do they make a snow pant that will keep kids dry????  Look else where if you want to have a dry kid.",2.0
"I have a thin boy and a husky girl.  Both kids tried the pants on.  The length was perfect.  The waist was way too big on both kids.  Although the waistband did adjust, it was only about 1-2 inches of adjustment, so it did little good overall.",2.0
Great material but way too big for a child size Large. Fits almost like a women's XL.,2.0
"Runs big & looks like boy pants.  My daughter hated that they look like boy pants.  She usually wears a 12 reg jean & the medium was slightly large on her.  The adjustable waist is a couple of Velcro tabs on the front waist, not much adjustment, they seem like nice thick snow pants.... We  Returned ours...",2.0
Got my 10 year old a medium but it was way too big on both the waist & length. I guess I'm gonna have to save it for next year or the year after that  all in all the pants look great just not true to size.,2.0
For this pants I need SIZE X-LARGE PLEASE,2.0
"have never had a brush tee break before, but the first two I used from this order broke after just a few drives, must be getting cheap in manufacturing",2.0

"If you're looking for powdered chalk, look elsewhere. The jar I got had some powdered chalk, but mostly it was chunks. The chunks range in size from almost 3"" across down to pea size. I'm used to powdered chalk, so maybe that's why I don't like it, but I have to crush the chunks in my chalk bag before I can get a good coat of chalk on my hands. Not what you want to do when you're on a route and your hands are getting greasy. My go-to chalk is Bison Competition Chalk, and it looks like I'm going back to it!

"The chalk does not collect well on your hands, and thus does not protect them and improve grip to the extent needed in heavy weightlifting.",2.0

"I don't know if i got a bad batch or what, but my chalk is, for lack of a better word.. stale. It feels like its old it doesn't stick to my hands and is super hard to break up. After I'm able to break it up it feels like sand when i try to rub in onto my hands, its hard, sharp and doesn't stick.",2.0
Very chunky. Had to put it through a food processor before using,2.0
"I bought these before and they were great. This most recent pack, I have had to throw away two of the balls after three uses because they keep coming apart at the staple. That makes them pointless.",2.0
"It's chalk....Not very good chalk, it has a tendency to slide off very easily, I am a rock climber and I have to use about 3 or 4 times as much of this than I did my last chalk, it also gets filmy and doesn't like to dry up or improve your sweaty grip very much.",2.0
"The very first chalk ball I used burst open after a couple of squeezes. Luckily it was in my chalk bag at the time, but I bought this product to avoid using loose chalk.  Evidently other reviewers have experienced this as well, so there are some quality control issues with this product.",2.0
"Very, very little yield through the sock. I actually wish it would rip. I have to pair it with liquid chalk for it to help my sweaty hands. Switching to loose chalk.",2.0
"The chalk works great. I've used this product before. Unfortunately, this time the chalk bag had a hold in it and chalk was all over the inside of the shipping box including the other two items that were included in the box/shipment. The total amount of chalk lost was minor and I was able to put tape over the hole to prevent further leaks but the chalk made a mess of my other two items.

Use caution when merging this product with other items in the same order..",2.0

I bought it because it said that it would work for the Imagine and it looked like the same key I had before. When I got it home it would not work. I was to big and would not even go in the slot. Just don't by it for the Imagine 10.0 cause it does not work.,2.0
"Not that great of a call, bought it for my son who likes to duck hunt, I myself am not too big on hunting.....rather be fishing!

We just got into the show and even the T-Shirt I bought isn't an ""original"" from Duck Dynasty but with it saying Hap-Pay, Hap-Pay, Hap-Pay and having ducks on it, she won't know that Phil signs the shirts. I found out after I ordered from Amazon and then went to the Duck Commander store. I am trying to pay less since I am on a fixed income but I am really upset about the duck call.

I don't like the dry molly as much as I like a wet Molly. Like STP and a good synthetic motor oil mixed.,2.0
"Again a problem with my order because of the picture quality. I purchased this for my daughter based on the color of blue and white.

"This thing was a disappointment big time. Very cheap for something over 20 bones. The head ""harness"" is just a velcro strap that wraps around your head. It doesn't stay tight and slips down over your ears which feels nice...I'm not too sure how sturdy this thing is and cover my face when using it in case it wants to snap and hit me in the eye.

"I was given a Spit'N Image as a present. I took it out one night in the late spring. I was fishing for striped bass along light lines in the Chesapeake Bay, under bridges. Third cast, I caught 3 stripers 18-23"". The fourth fish was coming to the boat and the middle hook pulled off. Not the split ring, but the actual hanger in the belly of the bait. That was disappointing. I reckon it's only good for freshwater usage, so keep that in mind when you use this bait. I myself won't use one again.",2.0
"I'm a bit puzzled by the overall positive reviews on this chrono.  Two poor design issues - 1.  The top info (Date/Day) or in Chrono (split time) are hard to see and partly hidden.  2.  The chrono split and Stop/Start buttons are very small so...if you running (or whatever) you really have to concentrate to hit them.  Not ideal.  Also, the watch is not all that 'bright' - hard to read.  I've had really good Timex in the past... not this one.",2.0
"It's very small, very tight.  If I knew it I wouldn't have bought it.",2.0
Way too thick and fuzzy.  I thought I was buying the Chelonia version.  Bad product description.,2.0

It is warm but slides off my head when I was it at a regular angle. I would literally have to put it to the top of my head to get it to stay but it looks dumb.,2.0
This product came looking great but I cannot catch anything with it. I have used it multiple times in active areas but has not worked out well. I have moved on more towards spinners and crawfish lures that have worked better.,2.0
"Like other reviewers mentioned, this headband fuzzed up really bad after only a couple of uses and it doesn't look good anymore. Wish I didn't buy 5 of them as presents and now return period already expired.",2.0
Fuzzed up after one use and looks like cheap fleece. It doesn't have much stretch to it. I have bought nicer ones at walmart. The only reason I bought one on here was because they were out of season in my area and we had an extra long winter this year and a late snow.,2.0
after few use it is broken,2.0
"Like another reviewer, I ordered the royal blue colored band and received a band that is bright turquoise. I am extremely disappointed because I really don't want this color. There were 2 choices of blue at the time and now there is only one, called Saffire. It's hard to tell what shade of blue Saffire truly is. I received the color called Atlantic and now it isn't even shown. Definitely NOT a color match to what I ordered. I'd probably have to pay to return this and pay shipping to receive another so this is why I decided on this rating.",2.0
"Although the headband is very soft and warm, the color (I got the lotus color) is at least two shades darker than it appears in the photo.  Instead of being a soft pink, it is more like a hot pink, which is definitely NOT the color that I was looking for.  Luckily, I can regift it to my mom who loves pink, but I'm not at all satisfied with the fact that the headband was not the color shown in the picture.  I would, however, purchase the product again due to its quality if and only if it was a color like white or black that cannot be messed up.",2.0
has no stretch,2.0
"The Rebel Crickhopper is a quality constructed and visually appealing lure, which is about as real looking as you could make a lure other than a tied fly.  It is the size of a large grasshopper so in that regard it is more than could fit in the mouth of a smaller trout or bluegill.  It probably would work best for largemouth bass. I can get trout and sunnies to follow it, but they never take it. I would not purchase again, but your experience may be better. When I hook my first fish on one of these, I'll change my review. Like a lot of artificial baits, this one catches fishermen, not fish!",2.0

The second shelf seems very flimsy!!
There needs to be a hole for a bolt between the upper and lower back portion for stability.

The only reason I give it two stars instead of One is due to the fact it looks good from a distance and is convenient.",2.0
"Does what it claims to do.  Annoying to put together and the metal scratches easily so assemble on a cloth or cardboard.  Some pieces came dented and already scratched, but by the time you open an find this out, it's too late and too much trouble to put back in box to return.",2.0

"The idea & the price were good.  The instructions were not detailed and after spending all the time to put it together, the last leg peg would not screw in because the threads inside the base where the leg goes is flawed. MADE IN CHINA",2.0
"Pretty cheap for the money I paid.  I hope it doesn't fall apart but I am skeptical about it staying together.  You almost need 2 people to put it together and it was done by myself, so it would have been put together much easier with 2 people.  I am a little disappointed in it but it looks nice and helps keep the garage organized.",2.0

"Was excited to use this thing to hold our clubs. Literally the last piece to finish building it didn't fit! I looked inside the screw hole and there was melted metal in the tread that was preventing the screw being able to be screwed in. I tried to use pliers to forced it in and no luck. I had to remove the pad to get it to sit evenly on the floor with the screw 1/4 in. I guess that solution works...

Bad QA!",2.0
Assembly not exactly easy. What made it harder was some pieces had the holes drilled in he wrong places. Had to contact Suncast to get replacement parts. Christmas gift spoiled as it had to be given in late January once assembly was finalized.,2.0

I returned it.",2.0
The pieces were not easy to assemble and I am missing a wall. Right now I have ghetto rigged one of the sides since in my package I received two middles. I am missing the right side wall that has a foot peg,2.0
item is cheaply made and was damaged in multiple places upon delivery.  Would not recommend!!!,2.0
I believe was a returned item because the box looked like it had been taped back up.  The mesh sides were dented and had holes and was missing a bracket that should have been welded to the metal to hold the shelf in place.  Luckily my husband is a bit of an engineer so he was able to drill a hole and add a peg to get the shelf to work.  You also need to 2 people to assemble this product.  It now works fine for a garage item but I think its was over priced.  We probably should have returned it for a new one but we didn't feel like dealing with the hassle.,2.0
"Sturdy and pretty easy to assemble. (Until the shelves) Not happy with the quality of welding on the shelves.
Two of the three shelves fit terrible because of poor positioning of the shelf mounts. Had to hammer and pliers to get them to fit.
They still didn't fit well after the tweeting. Plus...the nice paint finish took a beating from the pliers and hammer.",2.0
"Design is good, but product is crappy. Shipment came really quick.

Three shelves for shoe/ball storage on the right don't fit properly. Front left side is about 1cm lower than right side for all three shelves, so all three shelves are not levelled. Support bracket on top right is higher than it should be, so the decorative cover cannot be installed as the holes are not aligned properly.",2.0

Two Full size bags do not fit in space as poto shows. Only one bag can fit and my bags are average size. A lot more difficult to assemble than I expected. I was required to use a vice grip wrench to aline pieces in order to screw them together. Soldered piece to hold up shelf was broken off. Would not recommend. Cheap Chinese construction.,2.0
"The quality and measurements of materials isn't very good. Some pieces don't line up and either two of the feet or their holes weren't tapped well because I had to really crank down to get the feet screwed in. General assembly of the organizer can be a pain too. I sliced my thumb when a piece didn't stay put and it crashed down on my hand.

I give it a 2-star rating instead of a 1 because once you actually do get it assembled, it holds your golf bag like it says, it just doesn't look good doing it.",2.0
"Had to return mine.  Felt like I was looking through a straw.  And the optics off center had that wine glass / barrel distortion that was distracting, to me.  Finally , I spent much longer than normal with the diopter trying to get the reticle sharp.  Not sure I ever really did, which in itself says alot.  I'm sure it works fine.  And to be fair, I normally spend a bit more on my optics than this.  After seeing this one, I will go back to spending a bit more.",2.0

It can fit a cart bag and maybe a skinny carry bags but 3 or 4 more inches in width and the problem is solved. Does it really cost that much more to add those few inches to a cheap sheet metal?
I gave it 2 stars because it is still better than other organizers with individual compartments that don't even fit a single cart bag. Also, the holes were aligned correctly which is always a blessing! The assembly instructions were also good with adequate pictorials and plain english instead of the ridiculous translations that everybody has experienced at some point.
The top cubby is fully enclosed which is very convenient for loose golf balls, tees and other golf stuff.
Again, if you're hoping to fit 2 full size cart bags, keep looking.",2.0
"This unit can only handle  two very small bags, not the average size most golfers use. Had to remove the shelving units to accommodate both bags comfortably.",2.0
Mounted well to my Rossi 92.  But the angle of the mount is such that the scope I affixed could not be adjusted far enough down to achieve zero.  Bummer,2.0
"Should be more specific. Did not fit my 2004 Rossi single shot. Ended up giving it to someone I knew who had the ""correct"" model, however, it is a quality product. Just needs to be advertised better.",2.0

I work out of the country so throughout the year I do a lot of on-line shopping. Found this and thought it would help with keeping my closet clean (my wife uses my closet for a dumping ground including both sets of our golf clubs) while I'm away at work. Product arrived and my son attempted to put it together but wasn't very successful. My wife says the mesh netting at the back arrived with two (2) large holes in it.  Like the idea and design from the picture but this purchase doesn't seam to be working out. Will be sending it back as soon as my son can get it to fit back into the box it arrived in.,2.0
Elevation dial does not change reticle location.,2.0
"The instructions were very poorly written in order to assemble the product.  Secondly, the connection did not completely match up so you need to use a drill to adjust the spots to allow for the nuts to slide through the joints.",2.0
"This was my schooling that weaver rails are not picatinny. Who knew... The terms get swapped around it seams and the photo of the packaged part, rather than a close up fooled me. So now I know.

The part fits the gun great, but I will be replacing it with a PICATINNY rail regardless, because all of my scopes are PICATINNY, not weaver so they can be swapped around.

I'm giving this 2 stars because if the photo had been of the part, and not the nondescript plastic package, I might not have made the mistake",2.0
This item will scratch up your receiver and when it comes time to clean you have to remove it via two retaining pins.,2.0
"It shot a 2 foot pattern with Winchester slugs which were not too hot and a 4 foot pattern with hotter Herters slugs.
Took it off after 4 boxes of slugs and plan to use my 308 instead which shoots a 1/4 inch pattern at 100 yards.  The slug has tremendous knockdown power but you have to hit the target first.  I might have my 1100 drilled and tapped.  When you push up and down on the scope the mount gives.  It was something to play with and until you look at the target after using a great lead sled you just don't realize it is a waist of time.  I was using a Nicon 3 x 9  50mm scope.",2.0
They need modification or shimming to fit securely and not rattle around. The other problem I had with them is the fact that even though the package claims that they will fit a scope with a 40mm OBJ lens they did not allow enough clearance for my scope. Now I have to find another option for scope rings.,2.0
"Quality seems fine but these are too short to be considered medium.  I tried mounting a BSA sweet .22 scope to a ruger 10/22 with a bull barrel and had the scope contacting the bull barrel.  I tried another medium set of rings that gave the scope 3/8"" clearance from the bull barrel.  This may work fine with a stock 10/22 barrel.",2.0
"These are described as fitting up to 40mm scopes, but my 32mm scope was resting on the barrel of my 10/22.  Had to get high rings, and even then the 32mm scope barely cleared.  I also think the 4 bands are just an annoying gimmick -- you've got twice as many bands to index and keep straight while lapping and mounting your scope.  I don't see how the 4 bands, with 1 screw per side, is any improvement over 2 wide bands with 2 screws per side.",2.0
"cheaply made, marks up scope,and won""t hold zero on high powered rifle. had to purchase quality rings to satisfy my requirements. probably would be good for small caliber rifle.",2.0
These did NOT work on a Ruger LVT 10/22 with 40mm scope.  They are nice rings however.  I had to order the high ones.  I see on the high ones folks commented about this happening also.  Should have read that first.,2.0
Tops of the rings are not perfectly round. If you are not careful you might cross thread the screws. I intended to mount a Leupold vary x3 2.5 x 8. However with a 36mm objective lens I had light contact with the folded down rear sight on my Ruger American 17HMR. Had to mount a vari x1. 4 x28mm fixed power. I will replace these rings.  So pros are they were cheap. The cons are they are cheap.,2.0
It is not identical to the picture and is misleading and the scope will not fit my rifle. words words,2.0
"These are listed as medium profile but they are not, they are low profile and are useless for my application.if I needed low profile, they would probably fit the bill.",2.0
"Weaver base quality is great.  However, the front mounting screws were too long and need to be ground down when mounting on Savage 223 bolt rifle; but are not too long with use on the 308 Savage.  Caution: Package only containes one base and screws.  If mounting a scope you will need to purchase two.  Savage advises using these bases so i'm not sure why the screws were a problem on the 223.",2.0
"Ave quality, poor instructions, virtually no clearance.  Consumers have gotten used to the idea that an average product is somehow excellent.  There is nothing particularly strong about this product.  It meets my minimum expectation overall.  The clearance with a 40mm nikon rimfire scope on a ruger 10-22 takedown is almost zero.  It almost touches the barrell.  This is a terrible oversight.  The lens/dust cap will not fit (it is that close) so I have to cut and modify the lens protectors to get them on.  The instructions do not give guidance on recommended positioning of the scope, centering (or front or rear justified).  I did not buy and install a series of competitive products to see if and what might be better.  I can say that this product in its design and implementation falls short of what you should expect.",2.0
Like others have said the mount doesn't work with a Pardner Pump. Had to call to get new screws that should be longer. Still waiting for them to come in. Thinking about just returning it and getting something different.,2.0
hard to balance it so that all 8 bolts are screwed in correctly. My recommendation is get a mount that has less screw ports for you to manage and it would make things much easier. I guess in the same arguement you have more flexibility to choose how you want it mounted. Personally I don't like it,2.0
"I ordered a 92A for my Rossi matched set .22 single, because the ad impied it was made for that particular model. It was about .050"" too long to let the barrel lock shut and I had to remove it and machine one end off. Very disappointeed in Weaver.",2.0
One of screws was not true.,2.0
Arrived with 1 screw missing.,2.0
"I had higher holes for this scope. It's chrome like my 10/22, but on the side it says MANUFACTURED IN CHINA. Just ducky. I'm not a fan of Chinese products really, but to emblazon the text in English across the side of the scope? That sucks.

What else sucks are the rings. The seller did not include the rings in error but made right and I got them separately. They even had a shipping paper in it from Bushnell. That sounds like a fine optical company yes? Well the rings feel like they were made out of cast lead!  Yep,not even the quality of a home made wadcutter!

Well when you put this combo on a 10/22 it looks very pretty. When you get closer you see the imperfections. When you hold it, you feel the imperfections. When you use it, you feel like you got cheated.

Next time I'll spend the same on the scope as I spent on the rifle. I'm very disappointed in the quality of the scope. This may work for a kid's BB gun, airsoft, or just for looks on that rifle you want to hang over the fireplace. But if you want to use the thing on a 10/22, I';d say please pass and spend more. You will be glad that you did.

Who two stars? Well it does magnify and zero. But that's it's job, so one star for that. The quality of the scope, as bad as it is, runs circles around the quality of the rings. So I give them credit for that. To earn more stars I'd expect it to secure to the gun better, but that may be more a ring issue. And I'd want it to focus a bit closer. As it I am out of rail space and cannot move the scope any further from my eye and I can barely focus. it is pressed forward in the rings and the rings are forward on the rifle. Maybe they should include a stock extension.",2.0
"When I looked up the model and caliber ( 340 Savage 3030 Winchester ) this was the product recommended. When I received the product there were no instructions in the box, the stock had to be shaved off by 3/16"" midway from the rear forward from where the bracket attaches to the side mount screw ports on the receiver. After mounting the bracket, the scope rings do not quite center the barrel, they are offset by 3/8"" or better to the left side of the gun. Also the rings ride high. And after installing a fixed power scope, I find its 2 and 3/4"" from the bottom of the scope to the center of the barrel. Which is too much MOA for my taste. If the scope rings could adjust in or outward, I would probably keep it. As it is now I 'm gong to use it as an expensive fishing weight.",2.0
Nothing against the scope rings but they where not tall enough for .257 and I had to send them back.,2.0
"You get what you pay for. Honestly they aren't -bad-, they are innexpensive low profile rings that are good for a .22 or something, but they rattle to much with my .308 and my 5.56

the main reason it lost an extra start instead of being average rating, is they are not only low profile, but I cannot look UNDER them because of the bolt in the way and I bought them to use with a rail that allows both the scope and irons, but this bolt is in the way, even though it doesn't look like it in the pic.",2.0
You get what you pay for just throw the scope mounts away they are garbage. The scope is not bad for the money.,2.0
The scope quality is good. One of the screws were missing from the rings which is really ghetto. I had to use some other black rings I had that don't match the color. Lame.,2.0

"Ok for the price, but I have scopes that cost a little more that are much better optically.  Does the job on my AR, but next time I'll spend more.  It seems to adjust and hold zero okay, but it should on a .223.  Didn't expect much for $60, got exactly what I expected.",2.0
"The scope moves all over the paper when you adjust the power ,not good, not sure about returns.",2.0

"I order this item from Optics Planet and it came very quickly and professionally packaged.  Scope has a good bright clear image.  When I went to bore site the scope on the rifle I removed the turret covers and discovered that both the elevation and windage turret caps had not been tightened and both spun freely.

I pulled out an allen key and set the turret caps correctly which was confirmed by a rather non friendly customer service person at Tasco.  I offered the serial number on the scope but customer service explained to me ""it's not going to make any difference""

Scope may be good over time but factory support lousy.  Everyone should inspect their scope before mounting it.",2.0

"I bought this with the teak brightener.  I used the cleaner on 4 of my outdoor teak chairs. You need to use a lot of elbow grease and leave the cleaner on a bit longer than recommended. The brightener worked great. On my final two chairs, I had run out of both products, so used a mixture of laundry detergent, bleach, and tsp, equal parts, in a gallon of water. I think the results were exactly the same. The trick with both methods is to leave the stuff on at least a half hour, then scrub. I think the bleach in my method accomplishes the same as the brightener  The blogs I read said not to use steel wool, but I found it was best for removing the dirt as it loosened up.",3.0
"The cleaner really didn't make much of a lightening difference in the color of the teak shower stool i have.  After using the teak oil, I really can't say that there was that much of an improvement.

"I mention it, because they are showing photos of the newer boxes with ""Socker Boppers"" on it.
Then they have photos of the actual item, and it is the older versions called ""Sock'em Boppers"".

If you get the original ones, they are a lot of fun for kids.
We had twins, and had two sets of these.  When things got too heated, they were told to go out
in the backyard with these and ""work things out"".  They are inflatable plastic gloves. As long as they are
not inflated too hard, they don't really hurt anyone. Most of the time, the kids ended up laughing too much to
inflict any harm.

I was reading a few of the other reviews, and was amazed that someone said they had pulled a child's arm
out of the socket. I cannot even imagine how that could happen. Maybe if the child was way too young to use
these (or incredibly undernourished!) and the parents yanked like crazy people!  Your hands will sweat a little
when you use them - that's normal - it's plastic. But a simple way to get them off if they seem stuck is - wait for
it - open the air valve and let some air out!  Tah-dah! I hope I've saved a child's arm now.

The original toys were well-made. We were cleaning out old closets and found an original set. They still inflated
easily and worked just fine! We have a little newsprint on one of the gloves from being packed in a box of
whatever for almost a decade. Reading here, it would seem the newer ""socker boppers"" are not made as well, and
leak easily. I can't vouch for that, since I don't have a set of the new ones, only the older style ones.

Over all, these are a relatively harmless way for kids to get out some energy. Don't inflate them too hard, because
it could hurt a little if it is hard as a rock.  Most people are not going to do that - it'll be up to the parents
to check on how the kiddos are inflating/using them.
(For those of us who grew up in a non-PC (politically correct) world, isn't it amazing that we have survived
Sock'em Boppers, Duncan Yo-Yos (with a broken vase or two), Kabonkers (oh, the bruises I had on my arms!), and skates

"I have a pair of ""Sockem"" Boppers.  Then I ordered a pair of these ""Socker"" Boppers.

My ""Sockem"" Boppers never have this problem.  Cheap knock-offs!!  Try to find the old ""Sockem"" Boppers, not ""Socker"" Boppers.",3.0
"We love this Socker boppers. They are a lot of fun and provide a safe way to play ""rough"" without hurting. The only down side is that they de-inflate very easily.  And after a few months, they don't inflate to the max due to tiny holes. I probaly won't buy them again.",3.0

Bad:
1. With one bike it wobles a lot.  It should come with a couple of shims.
2. It doesn't come with the bolt and pin to attach it to your hitch.  (That was lame.)
Good:

"I generally like this ball because I can use it for it's intended function - to play basketball. The reason for the 3/5 stars is the ball's ability to hold air.  Not sure if I have a faulty pump, or the one I received was a bit flat, but with some pressure, it bounces okay, which explains the 3/5. All-in-all, it is a basketball and I will be using it to its full extent, which may or may not be a long time.",3.0
My two sons played with the ball the first day we got it and when they brought it back in it looked like a 10 year old ball!! I couldn't believe how much the pavement affected this ball. Maybe I should have bought a different type of ball?,3.0
I can't say whether I'd advise anyone to purchase this particular basketball or not. The reviews were that it came deflated somewhat so I was pre-warned AND yes it was deflated. It's still in our storage room with the thoughts of taking it to add more air and see if it will hold it. It truly is a disappointment if you're planning to use it upon opening.,3.0
"Its okay, Its very tube like rubber. I wanted something more close to leather. So that's why i think its an okay product.",3.0
"Bought this last Christmas, it made it through the summer, but by this point it no longer has any grip. So I got the kids another one this Christmas. At this price ($8.99) I believe we got our value out of it but feel it should have stood up to a little more abuse than it did.",3.0
Was a little disappointed in this.  It was large for a youth basketball and didn't retain it's bounce long.  A little hard to tell what you are getting.,3.0
"When these were rec'd they were deflated and since we don't have anything with that pin hole size to inflate it, we had to wait over a week to use them so I could get to the store and buy something. Which in turn cost me more money because I needed to go to a store and buy one for my son's basketball practices....Sigh! Once inflated the ball was great but to save myself time and money I shopped here, it ended up costing me extra time and money in the end.",3.0
"I liked this ball until about a week ago when it was poped when i shot a free throw. I mean this was mabey just a freak thing and i was just unlucky, but it did happen.",3.0
I actually thought it would be of better quality but I am happy with it. I mean it is what was advertised. The ball has the feel of a rubbery material instead of leather but you can't go wrong with the price. My son is 7 years old and this is a greatbstarter ball for him.,3.0
"I'm the guy down the street that likes to shoot a little hoops once in awhile.  I'm no pro, but I do like a decent ball.  This ball is probably worth the few bucks they're charging but my hopes were dashed when I received it the other day.  The product description clearly says ""..full grain leather cover"" then goes on to say ""ultimate INDOOR basketball"" while the amazon.com product description says ""rubber cover"".  So this is a case of confusing advertising.  Had I read that all before I quickly pressed ""buy it now"" and had I known it was a regular rubber basketball, I would have continued my search looking for an outdoor leather ball.

Like I said, it's probably worth the money, but if you are looking for a LEATHER BALL look elsewhere.",3.0
This has a definite rubber feel. The street ball has a better rubber cover. It is a good sized ball for the elementary kids to learn the game.,3.0
It was good.,3.0
Sled looks very cute & is made out of wood panels. One issue i have with it is that it sits so low to the ground & the panels are not nailed - they are tapled together; not sure how sturdy it is. I definetly suggest to get the pad for this sled - just to keep the snow out of it....,3.0

"I ordered this watch to use during my Army Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) 20 Nov-13 Dec 2001 class. My intent was to use it as my primary compass, just as I had the used my Suunto 'analong'wrist companss as my primary during IOBC and Ranger schools.  The Advizor failed me in that aspect.  Its North pointing arrow is a digital dot, opposed by a digital ""tail"" of three dots on the south side, making it a cool tool and a toy, but not a precision instrument.  Hence, I could not rely on such a civilian system to earn me my SF selection.  I ended up using the army issue compass to find my points on the STAR and the TREK. Since then, I use the compass when I am driving, or when I am lost in the underground road system in my city, where the Sun is not visible.
As for other elements, I use the heart rate monitor for my runs.  That is the most use that I get out of my watch.  But it is very very complicated, in that I have yet to learn how to opbtain the highest pulse, as well as the average pulse per workout..  The altimeter and barometer functions are useless to me, as the terrain in my area is so diverse, that terrain association alone can locate me within 50m of my location.
So for you soldiers out there, Suunto analog wrist compass (do not recall the actual name) that is available in AAFES clothing store is your best bet for compass.  This watch is useful only if you are out to get a heart rate monitor, but wouldn't mind paying a bit extra for a ""last minute back up compass"" that also shows time and air pressure.  Oh, it is water resistant only to 30 meters.. So you NAVY SEALs and SF Scuba dudes, stick to your G-Shocks.
Krusader, Out.",3.0
"I swear... I didn't push any buttons underwater.  If you're going to swim with this watch then don't buy it.  It was understood this watch was never meant for SCUBA or serious swimming, but even a few dips in the pool proved this watch is {garbage}.  Yes, the compass is handy.",3.0
"I received this product today and went to work putting it on the garage door.  My doors are, tack on, 8 feet each.  I unrolled the seal as I was tacking it on to the first door.  When I got to the edge I cut it off.  I moved to the second door and found out I had been shorted 5 inches of seal.  re-measuring I found the seal was only 15 feet, 7 in. long! Not the 16 feet advertised.
If the seal had been the proper length, I would have been delighted with it!  works great on goes on easy.  Nails with caps are proved for installation!
When you receive it, the first thing you should do is to measure the seal, before doing anything else, to make sure you have the correct length!

Watch out for this one!",3.0

"When ordering this one make sure its the one you need. There are many different type garage doors.
I'm sure its a great product if it will fit your door.",3.0
"PROS:  The price is VERY cheap & is actually pretty wide (other reviews complained about this)

CONS:  IF you actually use this as your only weather strip for the bottom of your garage door it provides little to no depth, thus water, wind, dirt, bugs and critters will still get in.  Unless your garage floor is extremely level and your garage door is closed with downward & sustained force (not likely) there will be gaps.

The strip is made of a rubber ""like"" material that has an almost spongy feel to it.  The supplied nails do NOT look like the picture, they include a black plastic type washer, because the nails along would rip through the rubber ""like strip.  NOTE that almost ALL garage door bottoms are metal these days - so the nail are useless.

I bought this NOT as a replacement for my current weather strip, but in the hopes of using a little of it as a CHEAP patch.  I have a two car garage with a single door.  On both ends there is a couple inch gap where my weather strip is short.  It has been that way since I bought the house from the previous owner.

I live in Florida & the other day I heard my wife yell - a snake was in our garage!  Snakes are ALL around in Florida, this like most was a harmless garter snake but still not something you want to see - even in a garage.  So as a quick/cheap fix I bought this.

I cut this to length of my gap & tried attaching it to the bottom of the door.  There was already on screw in the area I needed to patch so I started with that.  I quickly learned that I needed a washer because my first attempt ripped right through the strip.  My next problem was that I had to drill a starter hole in the bottom of the metal door plate which is quite thick.  My 18V battery operated drill (or maybe the little drill bit I had on the end of it) were NOT up to the task.  After 5 plus minutes of drilling with considerable pressure I barely put a mark in the door.

The next idea I had was to somehow glue the piece on the door bottom.  I tried just about everything.  Double sided heavy duty mounting tape, a whole tube of Crazy Glue and even Mighty Putty which you are suppose to be able to use on rubber.  Absolutely NOTHING will stick to this rubber ""like"" strip.

So I ended up just cutting 3 piece on each end to length, stacked them on top of each other, sate them on the floor where the gap was & closed the door.  On Monday I will just call in a garage door company and have them replace the whole thing.

I would have rated it lower except it is a good price & may work for a select FEW people.",3.0
I guess for replacement is OK . But they need to make it a little wider  . My older garage door has a wider one . I replaced the old one with this one and I wish the manufacturer of this gasket will think to make it wider .,3.0
We had one of these when my son was little...it held up for a whole summer tubing down the creek before it got a hole in it.  Purchased one just recently for my daughter to use the same way.  It got a whole in it the first trip down the creek.  I don't think they are made as well as they used to be.  This would be a great toy for the pool but isn't so great for our use.,3.0
"Pros: durable, cheap, easy to put together

Cons: inflating holes are the small style so deflating is a pain.

Happy with it considering the price but deflating both of them took me a while because of the small release valves.",3.0
"I don't love this as much as I wanted to. It takes about 30 solid minutes to pump it up with the manual hand pump included. Once in the water with it, you cant really sit up to row, I had to lay down and even then one side dips into the water and the other side goes into the air, making it uneven (and I am only 105 pounds). The oars are hard to use as well because they are not connected together. That might just be my mind not wanting to register the fact that you have to do two separate things at the same time.

It might be I didn't fully inflate it? But with that tiny hand pump its hard to do because it does not stay in the air hole while you are cranking the pump. I probably won't use it again. It was fun to just lay in and float for an hour though.",3.0
pump is a joke took 25 min to fill. so far looks ok for a kid no way you'd fit two people in it and with 210lb limit two smurfs maybe,3.0
Not bad if you use it as a secondary flotation device to hold additional items without them in the way of the main boat. For the price it's a quick alternative if you aren't expecting to use it more than a couple times.,3.0

It only last through the summer. It got a hole.  Be careful it's not that durable (not 2 layers).,3.0
"We only use it at the community swimming pool for one summer. It worked pretty well at first but then it gradually leaks air over time so sometimes my kid has to bring it up to pump! Still, he had good times with it.",3.0
"This product doesn't have a one-way valve to aid with blowing it up.  It only has a simple plug like you'd find on floaties, you know, where you blow it up and try and shove the attached plug in as fast as you can before the air rushes out.",3.0
"It was fun at the begainning, but broke in a few weeks:-(",3.0
The oars were hard to use but sturdy,3.0
"I like this thing alot. I have kayaked and canoed and bought this wanting to save money since I can't really afford to buy a kayak or a canoe. It's really awkward to paddle because you sit so far down in the boat and its an inflatable so the paddles rub against the side of the boat everytime you swing the paddle around. I love being on the water so its still worth it for me to continue to use this but it wasn't as enjoyable of an experience as I was hoping for. And my husband loves kayaking so he absolutely hated this boat and won't use it again in the future. But it seems extremely durable and its very easy to inflate, deflate, and put away in the box. and its EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE. Its squishy yet firm and you sit so far down in it- I thought I was going to fall asleep.",3.0
Very neat item but could be a bit wider and little more durable but other than that it was worth the price with 2 paddles and a air pump,3.0

"This boat was used for two days (one weekend). I didn't find any holes but it deflates much faster than can be enjoyed in the water.  Two or three toddlers got to sit in it while an adult walked on the shallow end of the lake hauling it. I expected the material to be a little on the stiff side, but it's really soft.  Probably won't buy another one again.",3.0
Took forever to inflate and deflate. You get what you pay for. It was perfect for our toddler and his little friends at the lake.,3.0
Not strong enough for young teenagers.,3.0

The boat itself is great but the loop to attach the rope thru lasted about 3 minutes before it split from the rubber and can not be repaired.  I would not buy again.,3.0
"This is a decent boat.  The only complaint that I have is that the oars do no sit nicely in the handles.  They come with oar ""stoppers"" to stop the oar from being pulled too far one way, but it should come with 2 sets of stoppers, one for each side of the oar. Otherwise, while rowing it gets a little cumbersome.  We've used this to pull a child behind us in the river while tubing.  Sturdy.  Fits an adult and small child easily.",3.0
"The float got me down the Bullhead City, AZ River Regatta just fine.  The oars fell apart though.",3.0
"Good for light use, but the bottom tore out of it after the second use.",3.0
"Great price, but not up to the wear and tear of a few eleven year old boys. I've purchased four over the last two years and within a few weeks, the bottom has ripped out of each one of them. To be fair, the kids jump into them from the side of the pool which shortly causes the rip. They'll work great if you just want to float around your pool calmly.",3.0
"The boat is great for kids.  I was hoping it was okay for me as a 6 foot tall guy.  I can fit in it fine, but there is a small leak somewhere and I have to reinflate it before each trip.

Later that night the repaired one popped again. We took them home repaired them again, all was good. 2 days later we took them out again and BOOM!  They both popped. These were 2 different lakes and used by 2 adults.  I'm usually very confident with Intex but a little Leary now.  We purchase a cheap raft from the Dollar General for our 10 and 4 yr old to share and theirs is still in great shape.",3.0
I bought this little boat and carried it to the beach for our family vacation.  It lasted 5 days before going flat.  I guess we got $20 worth of joy from it.,3.0
"Quick summary : kid sized boat, no leaks, susceptible to pokes, but does fine on pools and creeks.

Great ""disposable"" boat. We've owned three of the Intex Explorer boats. All three have holes due to pokes. Oddly enough all three met their demise on the way to the water. 2 through brush on the way to a river or creek and one on pavement on the way to the pool. They do fine in small creeks with slick or smooth rocks. Great in pools. Even floated them down calmer sections of the Colorado river. They struggle with pointy things though.

This boat is meant for kids. We can pack two 9yr olds and two 3yr olds in the pool. Going down a creek it will fit 2 9year olds and a 3yr old.

The air chamber on the floor is not ideal as it cannot be pushed back into the chamber so it protrudes from the bottom. Neither of the chambers are boston type valves so this means you've got to be quick when pulling out the pump and placing the cap back on.

Overall if you are in the market for a cheap inflatable that rides well in a river you can't beat this boat. Just be careful during transport and watch out for pokey things.",3.0

Girls (daughter and 10 yr. old friend) got a hold of it and thought it would be fun to drag each other over the waves breaking on the beach.  Quickly came to an end when got a hole in it :(  Tried to patch it with no success.  Don't know that I recommend or purchase again - as a bit expensive for one day's worth of fun.  Keep in mind... we go to a super soft, sandy white, ""Emerald Coast"" beach that is NOT full of shells, etc.  So, I would've thought it would be fine.",3.0
"Great boat but there is no easy way to deflate. You have to squeeze both the boat and plug to release. It takes forever. If you have room to leave air in this boat. Buy it, without hesitation.",3.0

"This is a toy, and a good one at that, but the oars work so poorly I can't give this better than 3 stars.  You can make the boat move, but just barely, and very uncomfortably. The paddle blades barely reach the water with any power unless they're almost vertical, no problem for me since I'm 6'3"" but even still it's very slow and uncomfortable. Since the paddles are so short, they're pretty much unusable by my six-year-old daughter too, it's really hard to get the blades in the water for her, and she's pretty coordinated. I think the ideal ages for this toy would be about 8 to 12 years old. Since none of us are that age, I can't rate this any higher, but I will say the plastic is strong and the kids still love goofing around in it, it's just too hard to use as an actual row boat.",3.0
"This has worked well for our grandchildren for playing in our creek but they cannot use the paddles, nor can I really, so they use their hands or drag each other by the rope we attached. It seems sturdy and the included pump works well.",3.0
Does not hold air well over a few days. Lots of fun and I use them in the pool mostly,3.0
I can only say I like it because I bought the tube to bring my dogs down the river and it wasn't sturdy enough to withstand the dog's nails. But it works well for people. :),3.0
It loses air very quickly.  size is great but not a long shelf-life!  Holds two big 10-year kids fine. Oars are good.,3.0
We have been enjoying this little boat.  The oars are fine and the size is great but there is a slow leak so we have to keep pumping it up.,3.0
The boat was for a good price and if your an adult then it fits one person just fine. the bottom lining of the boat isn't very tough so after using it just 4 or 5 times ive  already got a hole in it. that's why I gave only 3 stars. but other than that it works just fine just  as long as you don't have to go through shallow water.,3.0
it was good while it lasted but then it popped. its cheap. but I barely paid anything for it. it would have been great for just a few uses. its pretty handy but just not durable.,3.0
"It was fun for a bit, but you sit really low in it so it's hard to row.  We also kept having to put more air into the bottom portion.",3.0
"This boat is a toy, and should be expected to be used as such. It is very light, so if you take it anywhere with a current, you're pretty much at the mercy of the current. The oars are very flimsy and you won't get far unless you are on exceptionally calm water. For the price, however, it's a fun little boat.",3.0
"i am only 5'9 and it was small for me, the boat would be great for kids to practice using, the overall product was nice",3.0

"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour, 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.

Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.

It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.

So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However, if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too.",3.0
"I purchased this boat according to what it said, 2 person boat, but should of paid more attention to what other reviews were saying. It definitely is only
for one person unless you consider two toddlers would fit. The boat is very 'front' heavy so basically you cant sit in it the way you would expect to, you have
to sit backwards and row. I wanted it for fun at the lake for my 3 teen grandsons and sorry to say not one used it as it's too small and rather 'awkward'.",3.0
Purchased this for my daughter's birthday so we could use it on the lake.  It doesn't stay inflated very well.  Not that we sank but it did need to be blown up while we were out in it.  Fun for the price just don't expect too much! :),3.0
Don't plan on long usage as we have had to fill with air daily. Fun for kids in a pool. Would not use in any other situation like at the beach or any water that may get rough.,3.0
"I bought this boat for my grandson to use at the beach. The ocean was rough, but my granddaughter and two of her cousins rode in the boat at the same time and had an absolute blast riding breakers in to the beach. The bottom inflates separately, so don't forget to inflate it as well. The only thing I really did not like is the inflation valve. It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly. The valve on this boat (also an Intex product) you must squeeze together to let air out and it took a long, long time to deflate. If this boat had the same valve that comes on the River Rub tube I would give it 5 stars.",3.0
"This inflatable boat is a perfect toy for pools and shallow, calm lakes. It may also serve as a rescue boat for kids stranded too far out on a lake or pond.

The warnings on the boat will tell you not to use it as a flotation device, and rightly so. There are two good reasons for that.

First, the boat can slowly leak air. It won't sink with you in it, but the boat's structure is compromised with the loss of air, and this makes rowing difficult. If you're drifting away from shore and you need to row back, tough luck. You can do it, but it might take a while.

Second, it is very hard to keep the boat pointed straight. Think of it as a closed bottom inner tube. It has no rudder or stabilizing components. I can imagine the guy who rowed three miles in this thing must have come back pretty exhausted, because to row in a straight line you have to use a lot of hand strength and be willing to make quick corrections. He might have even had to blow a little extra air into the single chamber along the way to keep the structure intact. The only advantage I can think of is that it's wider than a kayak, so it's stable in boat wake.

Add this together and it's really more of a toy than a recreational boat.",3.0
had to buy a pump seperatly.,3.0

It wasn't 30 minutes of [hard] use until they were not round either.  There is a different model of wheel with a wider piece of hard plastic inside the rubber.  We ended up getting those and they wear better under our conditions.",3.0
"We bought this before our vacation this summer. It's made for 4 bikes but we could just BARELY load our 2adult bikes and 1 kids bike onto it. I have no idea how someone could put 4 bikes on this but I sure would like to see it!
If you are loading kids' bikes on the rack and have to attach a cross bar, good luck!! The bars that hold the bikes are fairly far apart making it difficult to load anything smaller than a full size bike. We could barely get our child's bike on and had to rig it.
Our rack came with no instructions for attaching this to your vehicle or instructions on how to best load your bikes. I had to resort to YouTube for suggestions from other bike rack owners.
With all that being said, it did keep our bikes safe and secure for 5 hours of highway driving. They didn't budge. And it didn't do any damage to our car.",3.0
"We just installed this rack and found a major error in the instructions.

Under the portion concerning how the straps are supposed to fit:

The instructions say to follow the picture on the left, not the right. But, look at the pictures. The one we are supposed to follow has the circle with a line through it (represents do NOT do this). If a person followed the written instructions, the straps would be too loose. We followed the photo instructions (and then tested for stability).",3.0

We wouldn't risk putting a fourth on there but then again, we're not risking because we don't know the exact weight of the bikes. Seems very sturdy. They've been using it since 2012 and much more frequently these past 2 years for 30min-2hour commutes on highways and downtown roads. The side hooks have definitely been scraping off the paint of the trunk and the kids said they would not use this rack on the newer cars.",3.0
"I have a Camry se 2014. Which says the product will fit fine. It does. Even though it was 4 places for 4 bikes,  I wouldn't travel with 4 bikes on it for a long term use bc with 3 bikes makes an indention in my bumper. My bike and my daughters bike have thicker frames & different design which makes it tough to get on. But if our bikes were like my husbands with the bar in the middle & skinny frame, then it would be easy. I can not buy the middle attachment bar (like some viewers have done) to make the bike easy to put on & off bc how the bike is designed. (They are Schwinn & Huffy beach-type bikes). Our sons bike is too small to put on. It will not fit.

 I also didn't know there wasn't a way to lock the bikes on so they wouldn't get stolen. I guess I didn't realize how easy it was to steal the bike rack either. There is a way to put the ropes inside the trunck but who wants to do that every time- it's not easy.

I'm 5'2 and I realized I had no muscle strength to raise the bikes over my head to load them up. They were so guava lifting up and down. Sigh I need to lift weights --note taken.

The metal clips will search your car from multiple uses. I suggest putting tennis tape on the inside of the clip.

4 bikes on it and watch your plastic number dent. My husband said it would help if I had towels under the cushioned pads to stabilize the shock. Sounds rational but I am over the bike rack. I shouldn't have to do that. The pads are thick and should do the job without extra support. Sigh.

Over all it's ok for now- but if I had to do it all over again- I would go to uhaul and have them put a hitch on my car for me so I can add a different bike carrier that would safely carry all four bikes & would be easier to load & unload.",3.0
"Obviously, those main bars stick WAAAAYYY out there. I've banged my head a few times.
It seems stable enough, even with four bikes loaded, but I always keep the heavies bikes mounted closest to the vehicle.
So far, I haven't noticed any damage to the car's deck lid or bumper. I have, however, gouged my aluminum bike frame pretty bad on the bolts holding the white end caps on the main bars. The bolts should have some sort of covering to keep this from happening. Good thing it wasn't a carbon-fiber frame, or it would require some costly repairs.",3.0
"I have three mountain bikes (two Mongoose and one DiamondBack) to mount on the back of my Sonata and while this was good to do so, that's all it could fit.  Had the poles been longer, then yes, I could put a 4th bike on the rack.  This should be considered for the types of bikes you have when you are looking for a car mount.

I bought this through the Amazon Warehouse to save money and I'm glad I did.  The bike mount for my Sonata works well for the three bikes I needed to haul for a ride a few weekends ago and you won't go wrong.  Regular bikes may work better but you may want to find this in a local store so you can size appropriately.",3.0

"we purchased this to take 4 bikes on vacation with us - 2 of the 4 bikes did not fit on the mount.  the child's bike was expected not to fit but an adult bike didn't fit either - the frame of the bike was too think to fit inside of the braces, and the bars of the mount were too far apart to fit inside the frame of the bike.

do not rush trhough the straps, be sure to tie the down even and tight.  if there is any wiggle room at all the whole mount will shift and bounce.",3.0
We bought this almost two years ago and just started using it.  It fits both our 2010 Prius and 2001 Town and Country.  If we were wanting to carry normal 20 speed adult bikes I would give this 5 stars but the kids bikes are a different story.  We have to fit 20 inch BMX bikes upside down (I really would not recommend this) and the 16 inch child's bike will not fit at all.  If anyone knows a trunk mounted bicycle rack that will hold 20 inch and smaller bikes please let us know.,3.0
"I am so happy to have it so that we can go places with our bikes.  However, you must know this -- it did seriously bend down the bumper (permanently) where all the weight of it rides when we had four bikes on it.

Also, if you have a woman's bike, or a kids bike, you will need to buy that bar that stretches across. And make sure you have a bunch of bungie cords as well.",3.0

Solution? I got myself a big tie wrap temporarily till I find a permanent solution all in all it's very sturdy u put 4 solid mountain bikes on it with no problems.... Just the makes me nervous while I'm driving tie wrap did the job just bring yourself a wire cutter or don't get to bike if you can't cut it. I still recommend to all straps no big deal I got tie giant tie wraps. Can't give it 5 stars coz of the short straps",3.0

"Well, it did what it was supposed too and it was as advertised, so in a way the product did not fail, but I am anxious about it in general. I can only comment about this particular version, here's my problem.

The four bike version has to hold, well four bikes, and that's a lot of bike to be giggling around hanging off the back of your car held on by just straps. No matter how many times I tightened the straps, the bikes wobbled around (since no road in America is totally smooth) and I was always afraid the whole thing would just fly off the back of the car onto the highway. I used extra chords and followed the installation instructions to the letter, but the total contraption together seems to teeter on the edge of it engineering boundary. Maybe its me. I think if the side to side foot print of the support frame was just a little wider for this four bike version, considering the four bike weight, it might be more stable over-all. OK, it did stay on and the bikes got there and back just fine, so lets say this one is me.

As much as I hate to admit this next one, if I was considering this rack, I would want to know this. The frame does stick out from the car pretty far - to hold the four bikes. I spent a lot of time putting this on and once we got there, I didn't want to take it off right away. Since it was new to the car of course I forgot it was there and smashed the top of my head closing the back hatch of my car to which it was attached, but so did my friend and so did my wife. It sticks out far enough to do some damage if you forget its there. Ouch! Anxiety and a lump on the trails X 3. Don't laugh, people almost never look up!

Last but not least, my wife forgot it was there (again) when she was backing up and broke the whole rear windshield as the supports looked for ""the path of least resistance"", that being the glass window (which the instructions do say is an installation option) although one I did not follow on my car specifically so I still do not know how she managed to do what she did.

I'm not a wimpy, cry in my soup kind of guy, and I admit some of what happened was stupid human error, but this thing made me nervous from start to finish. In the real world, with too much daily input, I just want to ride my bike for a while and not have to worry that I'm going to be responsible for killing a family on the highway because I put something on wrong - Its just a tick too much for me, personally.

Finally, it did do what it was supposed to do ( and more!) Allen designed it to meet a wide range of vehicles and a price point and I cannot argue about that. Please make sure you follow the directions carefully and make sure it will fit your car specifically, then don't look in the rear view mirror!",3.0
"We were going camping so we ordered this bike rack it hooks on the back of your minivan,it was realy fast shipping came the next day, my boyfriend took it out of the box which it came already to go so we were exited to get it on my van he finally got it on there and went to tieghten strap and it ripped right off, we had no time to return it or order a new one so we just used rope to help sacure it, onece he got the bikes on it was so flimsy did not hold 4 bikes very well so we used more rope to sacure it to the running rails on top of my car he was afraid when I was driving that the whole thing would brake off my car, so with all this extra effort it was so not worth it, on our way home we just through all the bikes in the back of his truck and contacted amazon once we got home , they were very friendly emailed me a return sticker and I dropped it off at ups store and by the next day got my full refund..NOTE"" if you are using this for just smaller kids bikes it might work better with less weight?""",3.0

The good news is that 4 bikes fit on the rack with very little  problem - I rotated the handlebars on bike #1 90 degress to help the puzzle fit but that was the only modification.  The bad news is, when we arrived at our destination there was some damage to the rear door of our vehicle, where the lower bar rests.  That is a lot of weight, and apparently that part of the door could not handle it.  There are a couple small dents, which are not exceedingly hideous but are noticable.  I am considering adding some kind of buffer to that area, something that can absorb / distrubute the weight without incurring further damage to the door.  Anybody have any suggestions?",3.0

He is avg height and can reach the pedals, but still cannot make it go. He has fun just making it go with his feet on the floor. He soon will be old enough to pedal by himself. This is an excellent beginners tricycle, and the seat extends for older kids. This is the trike to buy.",3.0
I think this is an adorable trike. However I was lead to beleive by the picture that you would be able to steer the trike using the push handle. This is not the case.

We bought a different Radio Flier for our son and we were able to steer it from the push handle so we beleived it would be the same.,3.0

However, on this particular model, the adult push bar is completely useless.  You cannot assist with steering, if you do, you will tip your child.  The adult push bar is only useful for a straight line ride.  I wish I had bought a more durable, sturdy trike!",3.0

"it generrally works at close range, but there are issues in slightly low light and the distance even in proper lighting does not record on the display.",3.0
"I bought the rangefinder to measure out driving range's flag distances.  Some of the distance are questionable because when I shoot a flag, it gives out 20 yards more then what it posted at the driving range.  When shooting at a yardage sign (which is a bigger target) the yardage is similar to the posted yardage (maybe 1-3 yards difference).  Also at night, it's very hard or impossible to get a reading unless the object you're shooting is white.

Con: Flimsy, almost toy type construction.  Not so good in dim lighting.  Need to have a big target and steady hands to operate it correctly.  May need to measure different targets to ensure you're getting the correct distance.

Pro: Light weight if you're carrying it on your waist belt and walking 18 holes.  No annual membership to pay for.  Great value for the price.  Good tool for a beginner golfer to practice his yardage.",3.0

"I have been playing golf for 50 yrs. on public (and some private, such as Pebble Beach) courses. Your buyer talked about the ""Rules of Golf."" First, they have so many rules--most of them stupid-- that the AVERAGE golfer can't possibly follow them. On a crowded public course do you really think you (or ANYONE) can take a ball back and hit another drive. There will already be at least one group ""behind"" you that you will be hitting into, and one on the tee wondering if you are insane to come back and slow down their game. The ""Rules"" are stupid enough (ask Craig Statler)for the pro players, but ARE SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN AVERAGE PLAYER ON A PUBLIC COURSE. By all means use a range finder if it will help your game. This is especially true if you travel and get a tee time on a course you have never seen before. HOW FAR IS IT TO THE DOG LEG? Don't know. For shame. Get out your range finder and find out what you need to hit. I have played many times where the slightest slow down will get a ball hit into you. I've cured that often if early in the round by taking a 7 iron and hitting the ball horizontally into the woods or water. It is an excellent training device in this era of greedy, uncaring pigs.",3.0

It was a very small contraption and I wanted to have more fun bouncing down memory lane so I got the adult version which is this model. It's built to last, very robust and with a tip that doesn't seem to erode over time. It's also taller so it's better for my 5'10"" frame. HOWEVER the central column is too wide and if you don't place your feet on the edges of the pedals just right, then you will bang your knees guaranteed. It's terrible, you get these painful bruises real quick. I read some other reviews that said that they used duct tape to protect themselves, which seems a little archaic. Just make a better product! Well of course, if you use the exterior of these pedals to avoid the knee pain, be careful not to fall off it while using it. I really hurt my shin the other day and it bled bad. Now I look at this toy with very wary eyes. I want to play with it, but I can't, because I know it'll hurt me ""sometime"" in the future.

That being said, it's hilarious watching blacked out people who have never pogo'd before get on it, and it's awesome watching chicks.

I guess my Super Pogo couldn't handle the pavement pounding we were giving it and the footrest eventually snapped off.

"I'm only 150-160lbs so I'm on the low end of the recommended weight for this stick.  However I was surprised how easy I could bottom out the compression/tension of the spring.  I was expecting that the primary limiting factor would be fear.  I was expecting a trampoline in a stick.  Part of me wishes I was only 80lbs (but then I would be severely anorexic) so that it would make it much harder to bottom out and thus obtain much higher heights.  I'm getting about 2.5ft. now.  Sure I know I could do more, but I'm disappointed and could not find a way to adjust the stick to prevent it from bottoming out.  I see this as an opening for an entrepreneur.

Coast effective for some uses but not  reliable  or study even  in near ideal condition  Buy a good patch kit at the same time,3.0
"It works as described. Somewhat time consuming to blow up and deflate, no carry case.",3.0
"Bought two of these, used them camping three times. On the third day one of them popped. great value, but quality lacking.",3.0
Comfortable and holds air.  Not very easy to inflate unless you have just the right attachment for your pump.,3.0
"I ordered this while on a camping trip after my old mattress deflated twice in one night. It was cheap and available with Prime so I ordered it hoping it would get me through one more trip this summer after which I'd look for something better.

I just inflated it in my livingroom to check comfort. The pillow is ridiculously firm. The only way to get it so my neck isn't at a painful angle is to let half the air out, but then my butt is hitting the floor which defeats the purpose.

I will never use this air matress but it doesn't pay to return it. I'm probably going to donate it to Goodwill or post it on Freecycle. Someone that likes superfirm pillows that you can't move may like it",3.0

"I ordered 2.  One works very well.  The other must have had a hole from the start.  I have not sent it back because I ordered it about 6 months ago, put it with the camping stuff still in its original packaging, and left it until our next camping trip.  Guess what? I ended up sleeping on the ground.  You get what you pay for",3.0
Uncomfortable and loud to move around on. Would not buy again.. but it was cheap so what do you expect?,3.0
Can't complain for the price. It's good if you have access to an inflator. Blowing it up is no fun. I don't recommend for backpack camping since it's not self inflating.,3.0
Reminded me of a laying down float that you could get around the same price or maybe cheaper. I wasn't too impressed but I laid on it while camping and eh for the price it was alright.,3.0
Fine to sleep on if you are really tired or don't roll around a lot during the night. Kept air in it the whole night,3.0
extremely long to inflate and deflate. Otherwise hapy,3.0
Broke not long after use,3.0
"Actual packed dimensions are 9""w x 8""l x 3""h. The weight is accurate at 3 lbs.
I am leaving for on international trip in a couple of days. This is larger than described so it may exceed my allowance. I purchased it as a backup. I haven't decided if I will return it if I'm over my limit.
I haven't inflated it and tested it yet, so this review is based only on the size issue.
The materials feel like pretty good quality, better than anything else at this price!
I wish people would provide accurate dimensions on items that are going in your exped bag! Both ""in use"" and ""packed""! Anyone who doesn't care about these numbers is traveling in a category higher than I can afford.",3.0
Okay for kids but kind of low quality. Have to blow it up by mouth.,3.0
Very heavy and hard to blow up. This does not seem like it was designed from camping. It is surprisingly heavy and takes a long time to blow up.,3.0
Great matris for sleep over gusts .,3.0
"Its nice once its blown up, but it takes too long even with an electric pump.  It also takes way too long to get the air back out.  If it had a bigger valve it would be so much easier!  Its just not convenient when setting up and breaking down camp.",3.0
"This was a first for me. I've always been more of a foam mat or just the ground kind of camper, but age is creeping up on me. My back dislikes any sleeping scenario that isn't my own bed. I thought I'd give this a go to try and alleviate some of the post camping pain I've become familiar with.

This appears to be very well built and quite durable. In contrast to other mattresses my friends were using, I didn't have to re-air this up every day. The second night it needed just a couple more lungs-full.

The sleep on it was another matter. There was no centering it. It seemed to want to rock side to side. I'd made sure the ground was level and free of rocks and sticks prior to tent setup. It was firm enough, but just wouldn't hold still.

I ended up sleeping with my body from my ribs up on it and the rest of me on the floor of the tent.

If you're body isn't revolting against you like mine is, you might find this comfortable. For the price, you can't help but try it out. Had it not rocked back and forth, it kept me well above the hard ground.",3.0
"The blow up valve on the mattress is not very good. It only cost me 10 dollars, so I should have expected that. No leaks or slow air loss after sleeping in it two nights.",3.0
Bought 2. One after the first one quit holding air and the second one gave out shortly after using it,3.0
It's not very comfortable but it's meant for camping so fine for that purpose.,3.0
Worked great. Didn't have any issues with it deflating at night.  Forgot my pump at home so I had to inflated by mouth which was not too difficult but it took some time. Only issue I had with it was the pillow (useless and unfortunately if you use bring a pillow like I do )and the width of the bed!  Wish It had a couple more inches on each side.  I am 5'7 170 there was no room to turn. Was not the worst but definitely could be better,3.0
"When you are on it, it spreads weight unevenly. Your butt will sink. And eventually, for me, it started deflating every night.",3.0
"The built in pillow isn't a pillow, bring your own. It's also slightly too skinny for me so I felt like I couldn't roll over, causing me not to get a good sleep. Kind of hold air, but had to put a little more air in every night.",3.0
"Just got done testing this out for the night.  If all you are looking for is something to get you off the ground, this is a great buy.  It has plenty of loft to get you off the ground.  I weigh over 300 lbs and this kept me off the ground like champ, even on my side.  That being said, you pay for that loft by expelling the remainder of your lungs into the mat after long hikes.  Took me about 15 minutes to blow it up.  It has a bite valve that took me a minute to figure out, making inflating and deflating not as straight forward as I would have liked.  There is a strong, STRONG plastic smell on this thing.  You'll wake up with everything smelling like it.  Might want to wash it down before first use, but I'm not sure that would help.  Do not expect any R value coming out of this.  If you want R value, you need to pay more.  The ""built in pillow"" isn't really a pillow.  It's just a change in design from the rest of the mat.  If you need a pillow - you better bring one!

All in all, my night was comfortable on this.  Can't imagine spending a week smelling like plastic though.  The smell is so strong I could imagine some people of weaker constitutions having issues with it.",3.0
"So this is OK for it's proper use - like tent camping where you can setup w/ a pump and stay in 1 location for 2-3 nights.
Not very ideal for backpacking. NOT very light (1-2lbs). NOT very fast to inflate/deflate.",3.0
Lightweight but I myself am a small person and for some reason it leaked air overnight. Kind of a pain to inflate and deflate. Good for its price,3.0
"It was great, for about a week then it deflated! ",3.0
"It is what it is, feels like a raft for the lake.",3.0
"So, this was good quality for the money.  However, it does not have a quick deflate valve.  It has essentially the same valve for a water air mattress, so when my husband and I tried to deflate it, it took two of us nearly 15 minutes trying to get it to deflate for storage.  In our case, we are needing it for a trip where we have to inflate and deflate daily, so for us, it will not work as a compact solution to needing another bed.  The plus side was it inflated with a manual hand pump in only 3 minutes.",3.0
"Seemed sturdy, but lost air quickly. I weigh about 180, It wasn't wide enough for an average adult in my opinion. I purchased 4 and used 3. They all reacted the same and 2 were used by kids.",3.0
It's OK and better than sleeping on the ground.  But it's essentially a floating mattress for the pool.,3.0
"Good for the price, but don't move during the night, you'll roll off",3.0
"Not super comfortable, but it works for overnight guests okay. Probably more comfortable for little ones and light use. Deflated slowly overnight. It served its purpose for the night but I've yet to use it out camping.",3.0
"Didn't last long, but it served the purpose while it lasted.",3.0
"Would have been great, nice size would have fit the sleeping bags perfectly. Could not get them to inflate the pillow.",3.0
the valve should be on the side. Difficult to inflate,3.0
Placement of the plug to inflate is in an awkward location.,3.0
This is actually pretty bulky and heavy.,3.0
Takes forever to get the air out.,3.0
For the price it is great!,3.0
"Bought two and one came damaged (wouldn't stay filled).  Got a replacement, but that one doesn't stay filled either.",3.0
"I bought these because they fold flat and are lightweight for camping, and needed room in the footlocker on the plane. Would have been better had they held air better and the baffles ran horizontally, rather than vertically. The bottoms are way too slippery for a tent, particularly if you have to rotate, like I do. After a few days of camping, I figured out they were easier to wedge together in the back of the SUV side by side, so I could sleep on them with the baffles running the proper direction. I don't see where my son, or grand kids would have any issues with these, they are smaller and younger and probably wouldn't flatten them out so easily.",3.0
"Used the mattress this last week.  It supported my 250 lb. weight well enough.  It was difficult to fill.  The mouthpiece seemed a bit short, or it was stuck so it couldn't be extracted.  I left it full for the next time I need it.  Regardless, it is a hard to find size and I was glad to find it.",3.0
"I bought this to take on a camping trip after my coleman developed a leak.  I sat there trying to blow it up for like 10-15 mins before abandoning ship and just sleeping on the tent floor... it wasn't even halfway inflated.  If you want to use this, you're going to want to pack in a pump.",3.0
I got two for our recent camping trip in late August. I used a portable air pump because blowing it manually would take forever. It did its job of keeping us off the ground but I could never get it to fully inflate. It always felt like it could take more air and we ended up with an almost deflated mattress in the mornings. For the price though it was pretty good as we didn't have to sleep on a rocky floor.,3.0
Not very comfortable.  Though it seems to hold air.  A quailty I don't expect with intex products. I wish it we're a bit thicker.,3.0
Had to reinflate each morning so that was annoying but for $8 it wasn't the end of the world,3.0
Three arrived defective.  Once filled with air they didn't hold for too long.  All the others were excellent.,3.0
You need to inflate it every night. Using it on a cot while out in the field. The built in pilow is eh I would buy one without the pillow,3.0
"Comfy, but really difficult to inflate and deflate, even with a bellows or electric pump.",3.0
Just ok more suited for kids,3.0
"I purchased this air mattress when it was under $10, not sure why the price has gone up. I have 3 kids so wanted a cheap air mattress for our hotel stays so we didn't have to pay for a roll-away bed from the hotel. This air mattress was good for 3-4 nights and then kept deflating, I feel we took good care of it so it must be the quality. I gave a 3 star review because I felt I got what I paid for and should have spent more money to begin with, however I wasn't able to find contact information to the seller to tell them my complaint.",3.0
"Served it's purpose OK for a last minute need.  Was sufficiently comfortable to sleep on, but it's a bit narrow, several inches less than my sleeping bag.  Also fill nozzle is a pain as others have said, both for filling and then letting air out.  But for $8 and got it the next day, it was what I needed at the time.",3.0
"Bought this for a recent camping trip in which I needed to be able to put it in my carryon for a cross country airplane trip first, so it needed to be light enough.

Pros- arrived quickly and was fairly easy to inflate by mouth, also held its air well and seemed sturdy, was light enough to carry-on, relatively easy to deflate if you know how/use common sense.

Cons- gave me some serious back and neck ache, particularly the pillow part.  Might not bother others, but I couldn't handle it.  I will use this in the future for my kids sleeping surface when camping, and probably either go back to the double high queen mattress (have become such a wuss in my ""old age"") or invest in a good cot.",3.0
"Update After a Year:
This inflatable mattress does not hold up to prolonged use. I'm sick of tracking down seem leaks etc. I use this maybe one weekend or so a month and it seems to be more trouble than its worth now. I do like this but I have to say it does not last.

Original Review:

I wish there was no pillow portion to this camping mattress or at least a separate compartment from the main mattress. If it was a separate inflatable or nonexistent this would be a 5 star product. The problem is when your body is laying on the mattress the pillow area is very stiffly inflated because there is no separation from the main portion of the mattress. However, for what it is it works great. I keep it rolled up in a sleeping bag and in the back of my car. I have used this numerous times both on house floors and inside tents. It takes a while to blow up without any kind of compressor but it is possible. I have bought a second one of these since purchasing this first one. It comes with a patch in the box incase of small holes.",3.0
Not the most comfortable mattress I've ever sleapt on but does the job.,3.0
It's a nice air mattress. You definitely want some type of pump to use with it unless you want to give it to your kids to blow up to keep them busy for a while. I don't think I'll use it again for backpacking considering the weight (i'm going to switch to a hammock so that's beside the point) however I'm 220lbs and this thing stayed inflated all night long and was fairly comfortable. Good deal for the price.,3.0
I didn't get to use it personally but everyone else complained about constantly sliding off. Otherwise it served its purpose.,3.0
"Takes about 5-6 minutes to inflate. It holds the air fairly well (may contract or expand depending on temperature). It is fine for the casual camper but it does have some drawback: (1) it is too narrow, if you move even a little during sleep you will fall out of it, (2) it does not pack back to a small size, the best you can hope is to be able to get it back in the box but even that is difficult, (3) it won't provide any isolation from the floor temperature, definitely not recommended for cold environments.",3.0
deflated while on coral beach.,3.0
It's ok. Kept me comfy and warm.,3.0
"These were very difficult to inflate with the inflator I was using. We tried several times with the thin attachment and it didn't work as easily as expected. After several attempts, we finally got it to work and they performed well through the night. They stayed inflated well and provided good cushion.",3.0
"Well constructed but too narrow for an adult. I'm 6'2"" and 230 lbs so take my criticism with that in mind. It did keep me off the hard ground though and it was perfect for my child.",3.0
Good for kids,3.0
"This product is misrepresented by seller, it only has fabric on 1 side, I was hoping for both sides to be fabric. But it seems to be a nice quality mattress regardless. I just hope it will last for a while.",3.0
A little small for a tall person and quite difficult to get inflated but it works well for the price.,3.0
"We took our Boy Scouts on a camping trip recently where the first night they camped in tents in a state park and the second night, we camped inside a cave (I only came for the second night). Knowing the ground would be rocky in the cave, we purchased five of these inflatable mats for our family.

The first night the boys borrowed a pump to inflate the mats and there were no complaints. Deflating them in the morning was a different matter. There's no quick deflate valve or anything so it's a royal pain to get all the air out. We found the easiest thing was to have one person hold the air valve open while another person started rolling from the bottom of the mat to squeeze all the air out.

The second night, the boys inflated their mattresses themselves and there was much whining and complaining. Personally, I didn't think it was all that bad. I huffed and puffed for about 5 minutes, then took a break, then another 5 minutes and it was done.

I inflated my mattress about an hour before bed. When I got ready to lay down, it was noticeably flatter! I blew it up some more to get to a firmness I was comfortable with, but by morning, it was flat again. None of the boys complained about their mattresses leaking so maybe it was just mine.

I'm a big girl and I toss and turn a lot in my sleep so the mattress is a little narrow for my taste. I rolled off of it a couple of times during the night. I also wound up rolling up my husband's jacket to use under my head as a pillow because the pillow on this mattress is the same height as the mattress.

After the campout, we asked the boys if they wanted to keep these mattresses with their camping stuff and they all said no, it's too much trouble to use most of the time. At about $7 each, we were all glad to have these mats for sleeping on the rocky floor in the cave but I don't think any of us will use them on a regular basis.",3.0
"Portable size compared to standard size inflatable twin mattress. Pillow is more firm than I prefer, and the design of the rippled body section is a bit uncomfortable.",3.0
"It got me through about a week of camping, but then developed a slow leak (no visible puncture marks). I woke up on a deflated mattress several nights before throwing away. For the price, it got me through and provided adequate comfort for the time I needed it.",3.0
"I know this is a cheap mattress which is why I am even giving it three stars. I do like the fabric top, but that's about it as far as camping mattresses go. This is really heavy vinyl, which makes it durable, but it wouldn't be good for backpacking. It takes a while to blow up, so again if you're car camping that would probably be okay if you have an air pump you can plug into your car. It holds a lot of air, so if you are camping somewhere really cold like I was, it won't keep you very warm, the opposite actually. It's just okay.",3.0
"This is a cheap product.  It is a pain to inflate and deflate.  It is marginally more comfortable than sleeping on the ground I suppose.  With some man-handling, it can be compressed into a small space for backpacking or camping.  I stopped carrying it in my 72 hour pack in lieu of a standard military green roll up mat which sits on top of my pack.  For the price it isn't bad.  I wouldn't buy it again though.",3.0
It is really small and thin.,3.0
"I really like these mats, and bought 4 of these for a kids sleepover.  3 were perfect and one had a hole, it deflated before we could use it.  It is too much trouble to return, and the mats come with a repair kit, so we might try to patch the defective mat.  I would have given 4 stars if all mats were perfect.  They are a great price and the kids slept well on them.",3.0
"Long enough, but not wide enough. Laying on my back, my hands and arms would fall off the sides. Laying on my side, I would roll off during the course of the night.",3.0
"Not a bad mattress for the price, got me through my first backpacking adventure.  However, it is nearly impossible to inflate by mouth and most certainly requires a pump which I also purchased.  I found it to be really firm but that could be remedied by deflating slightly.  Overall it doesn't weigh very much but coupled with the pump occupies a fair amount of pack space and takes forever to deflate.  But let's be honest, it can be had for about $8, good solution for the frugal buyers out there willing to accept some trade-offs.",3.0
"I am 6 foot tall, and this is actually long enough for me.  The thing I didn't like about it is that is all too easy to roll off of this mattress.  One wrong move and it dumps you right out!",3.0
"It was extremely difficult to air up.  The valve did not want to allow much air to pass through.  We spent approx 15 min pinching the valve trying to find the ""happy spot"" but nothing seemed to improve the quantity of air it would allow.  It did not loose any air after 3 days however.",3.0
So far I've slept on it at home to test it out and it works fine.  And despite the fact that I've read all the other reviews talking about what a pain it is to inflate because of the pinch valve... I was still allured by the low price.  And I will be one more reviewer that complains about what a pain it is to blow up.  I need a valve attachment to my battery powered pump that I use for my other inflatable mattress.  So that's not any fault of this product... just my own incompetence.,3.0
"Just like a heavier duty swimming pool float.  The valve takes air slowly and, more irritatingly, releases air slowly.  If you sleep in one position all night then this might be fine for you but it is way too narrow if you're a person that EVER rolls over.  Hard to roll over even on one side without falling off.  Quality seems good enough but I would not buy this again.",3.0
"It was relatively easy to inflate it by blowing air through mouth, took around 20 min. However, it feels very uncomfortable to sleep on. The width is less making it difficult to roll over or move side to side. The mattress tends to tilt / tip over if you change sides. Also it doesn't feel very comfortabelto sleep on, stiffness is high. Overall a decent product but there are certainly better out there.",3.0
"I finally got around to needing to use this air mattress and my initial impression was good.  It inflated easily with an electric pump and held air well.  It kept me off the ground and seemed very comfortable,  Then my trouble started.  The built in pillow is too large for a side sleeper like me.  I typically put my arm under my head and sleep on my side.  With this giant inflated pillow, my arm almost immediately went numb and it made it impossible to get comfortable.  If you sleep on your back with a normal pillow, this would be great, but for me it just doesn't work.  I may try it with the pillow at the foot end just to try to get some use out of it, but otherwise, I'll be looking for something else to use for camping.",3.0
"After a couple of uses, I'm giving up and switching to self-inflatable. I bought this with the Intex bellows foot pump, but the pump wasn't as speedy as I'd hoped. It had a fair amount of air loss, so it wasn't much faster than inflating by mouth (10-15 m each).  I slept fine on it once it was inflated and the vinyl seems to be sturdy and good quality, but both inflating and deflating would be MUCH faster on a pad with self-inflatable valves.",3.0
"ok for the price, but you'd better be damn near exhausted when you lay down, or else you may not get to sleep.",3.0
well made,3.0
"I liked it, however it was hard to inflate .",3.0
crinkles when sleeping on it. Makes a lot of noise.,3.0
"Havn't camped with it yet but it looks like what I want for car camping.  I blew it up with a compressor and it has stayed firm for about a month so no leaks.  Plus side- inexpensive, negative- it looks like it could be punctured fairly easy.  Worth a go though.",3.0
"This made it MUCH more comfortable than a bare sleeping bag on the tent floor. Best feature is it didn't deflate during the night. Only reason I gave 3 stars is it took a while to blow up manually and when using it for extra ""beds"" on a trip, kids ditched them for the floor as it wasn't comfortable.",3.0
"Well, i've bought these a couple times over the years and used on a variety of camping and backpacking trips (bought from walmart, thats why not verified). They do take a really long time to inflate. however, They are very comfy....when they stay inflated. But, i have found out the hard way that they don't last long. All 4 I have purchased eventually start leaking air mainly around the seam that connects the pillow part to the rest. Not fun at all to wake up in the middle of the night with a flat matress.  If you are just looking for something cheap for a camping weekend then these would suffice. If you do a lot of camping like we do invest in something that will last longer.",3.0
Was so hard to inflate!  I went to the mountains in the snow and camped in a tent. Not sure if the weather and elevation had to do something with it. It inflated within around 10 minutes and I slept well. I love that it comes with a built in pillow ,3.0
dogs like it,3.0
"Product is fairly comfortable, however if you plan on using this for backpacking or otherwise just value packing lightweight, I would suggest paying the extra $$ and getting a pad from a better brand (Big Agnes has great/light weight stuff).  If you are frugal and just want something to get you off the ground, this is probably the product for you.",3.0
The ripples in this made it uncomfortable for me.,3.0
"I have ordered 4, and one of them was defective, so I returned.  But the others held air all night, whole week in a cabin.",3.0
My 5 year old loves these but they fog up like crazy so he can't see. Every 2 minutes I'm having to fix them.,3.0
It's a fine air mattress but it's really noisy.  My plain vinyl one is is not noisy at all.,3.0
Haven't put it to the test yet. The event I originally bought I for got canceled.,3.0
"I bought two of these for my daughters.  It was a bit narrower than I would have liked, and the hole where you blow it up with is rather small.

It is not a bad air mattress though, and works for what it is needed.",3.0
"This air mattress is adequate.  It loses a significant proportion of its air overnight, to the point that your rear will be resting on the ground while your back and thighs will be supported.  I'll wait until this mattress is no longer adequate, but I certainly won't be buying this same one again.",3.0
"Certainly more comfortable than thin foam mats.

A better valve would be nice, a bit of an effort to blow up by mouth.
Not good for children (or people) who scroggle around a lot in their sleep!",3.0
It works for a while but I always seem to wake up half on the ground because it slowly deflates overnight.  Thought maybe the air getting colder overnight had something to do with it but not sure.  Still better than not having a mat at all though.,3.0
"I  purchased one last summer, it worked great and still works great.  I like the first one so well I bought another for a recent camping trip.  The second one, deflated completely the first night I used it. It would slowly lose all of its air in 7-8hours, so I could fall asleep but I would be sleeping on the ground by morning:(  The first one still works great I'm not sure what's wrong with the second.",3.0
"I bought this as an improvement from sleeping bags for my frequent camping trips. The plastic seems pretty durable, but I wouldn't be doing MMA on it either. It is not very wide, but it still beats sleeping on hard ground. I recommend buying a manual pump with it as well, blowing air into it will take a ton of time and energy.",3.0
Good small mattress for camping. It always deflated during the nigh a little bit but it was still comfortable since I like a soft mattress. It only last one season though.,3.0
It is ok went flat by morning- but it helped my grandchild go to sleep- think not for an adult's weight,3.0
It is a mattress and works as such.  However very had to blow up almost impossible to blow up manually even with a pump takes a long time to infalate.,3.0
"The Camping Mattress was relatively inexpensive. My girlfriend and I bought two of these. We used them when camping in Idaho this summer. They were both used in a tent on flat ground and aired up to specification. One of the two began to lose air suddenly on the second day. We couldn't find the source of the leak, and I felt that the plug wasn't staying sealed. Regardless of our efforts, the one mattress would not stay inflated for very long. The other mattress was fine, but seemed to have lost some air by the end of the third day. The good mattress never deflated completely like the bad one did. Perhaps there is inconsistent manufacturing of the product, or a lack of quality controls.",3.0
"I bought this mattress for my 4 year old son to use for camping. The 3 nights we've used it - held up fine not loosing air. BUT the top was completely damp as was the underside of his sleeping bag??? I am assuming from perspiration, but the inside of his sleeping bag was dry. So the plastic of the air mattress is sweating!! NOT GOOD when you are camping in colder climates to have a wet sleeping bag outside. The photo looks like the top is fabric as it says Fabric Camping Mattress as the product name, BUT it is only a molded plastic look, not fabric top. I'm confused by that. Anyway we won't be using it anymore for camping and will donate it. Bummer.",3.0
"Very firm mattress, but held air for three days. Would recommend for anyone tired of waking up on a flat mattress.",3.0
"Me and my wife have a small Coleman two person pop up tent and we wanted some air mattresses to pack down with us. These are ""ok"", your not sleeping on the ground but they're not super lightweight. If your into minimal camping, these are probably gonna be a little more weight than you wanna add but I was carrying two so it's personal preference.
They get the job done and weren't too expensive so take it for what it worth.

"Hey, if you need a cheap air mattress for a quick camping trip, this product would be great.  But make sure you aren't tall and don't move around a lot when you sleep.  My 10 year old kept falling off this at night and ending up on the floor of the tent instead.  We had to buy her a replacement mattress.",3.0
We used this for camping and although the mattress held air well it wasn't wide enough. My husband myself and both of our kids all woke up in the morning on the floor next to the mattress. I definitely feel like I wasted my money,3.0
"I'd have to say, this works, so that's good. It's long enough for a man of average height but, not much longer than that. It's quite narrow, however; if you're thinking of rolling over during the night, forget about it, you'll go right off the side. I've picked up much larger air mattresses for less at a local store. Of course, they don't deliver.

The mattress also lacks a large opening for quick inflation and deflation, having only the tiny little nozzle you might find on a beach ball. If you're hoping to use a pump to inflate it, let's hope you've got an appropriate adapter. Fortunately, it's small enough that you can reasonably expect to inflate it without a pump, it'll just take a bit.",3.0
The valve stem check valve had to be cut with a knife in order to blow up and it was still very difficult to add or remove air.,3.0
"If you have plans for car camping, it will work.  You should have a pump that plugs into the cigarette lighter,, it will take 2 min.  If you don't, it will take forever and you will get a headache from having use the air that you breath to blow it up.",3.0

"Very comfortable mattress,  easy to inflate and deflate.  A little bulky when packing.  A little heavy to carry on long trips",3.0
"I just received this product and though the quality seems good the size stated on the box is WAY off.  Inflated it measures 21 inches wide (instead of 26) and it is 5 1/4 inches high (instead of 6 3/4) It is also hard to release the valve to deflate it, you might want to take along tweezers or pliers to pull it out.",3.0
"Mattress seems to be plenty sturdy, and thick enough to keep you off the ground, but is too heavy to be good for backpacking.  In addition, it is too long to fit in my 1-person tent.  On the plus side, the built-in pillow is bigger than it looks in the photos, so you do not have to carry one.",3.0
"I got this matteress for two purposes: for camping and as a swimming mat.  My first experience with it might be extreme, but I used it for swimming on the Connecticut River, when water was a bit high and current was strong.  I didn't have a pump so I blew it up from scratch.  You have to sort of ""bite"" the opening in order to get air in, or you can put some kind of stick through.  Then push it inwards.  When I got it in water I was pleased with effect, it's narrow enough so I can lay on top and use my arms for paddling and controlling direction.  Though after a mile when I went ashore again, it was a bit deflated.  At least it kept me out of freezing water and I enjoyed the floating.

The thing is, this thing stinks!  The pic is misleading, the bottom is the worst kind of PVC vinyl and smells just like gasoline fumes!  I don't know if I could stand to have it inside a tent all night.  I'm trying to hang it out a few days and see if that helps.

As I say, the main reason I got it is because of that extreme narrowness; twin size is too wide for what I wanted to do for swimming.  It works, but let's face it, this is a cheap item and you get what you pay for here.",3.0
"well, we love this little air mattress. It's great for camping for our 9 year old son to sleep on! We bought it and got it in time for our 3 night camping trip. We set it up..he slept on it and by morning it was  flat!!! Very disapointed. Going to file a complaint and hopefully get a new one, I hope that this one has no hole...if so I will write another review advising not to purchase this mattress. Other then the hole, it is a perfect small one person camping mattress.",3.0

"For the price, these were awesome for 6 days in the Boundary Waters. I know they weigh more than a ThermaRest, but I thought this comfort was worth forgoing a pair of jeans. I bought two, one did seem to have a slight leak after a few days, but nothing that put either of us adults on the ground during the night. Each inflates in about 5 min of steady breathing. The built-in pillow is nice & shoving a packed rain suit under it helped feel like I was sleeping on one normal-sized pillow. They also worked better when putting the bottom side up as the sleeping bag was a little slippery on the fabric side. For sizing & comfort - I am 5'8"" 170 lbs & my husband is 6'2"" 200 lbs.",3.0
Comfortable. Holds air well. Could be wider. Valve must be pinched just right to inflate or deflate. This is a bit of a pain.,3.0

"My two year old daughter and I used the ""Ultimate Trike"" for a week until one of the steering cables broke. (I could turn only to the right). Big disappointment to spend $80 in a tricycle from Radio Flyer that last one week.

I visited the RadioFlyer customer service web site ([...]) and filled out a ""part replacement"" form. The next day a Customer Service Representative (Anshu Aul) contacted me and informed me that she will send me a replacement cable for free. She also explained that RadioFlyer made an improvement on the cable to make it more robust.

In summary:

Great product (when it work), but shame on RadioFlyer to introduce a fragile product to the market that doesn't represent the brand image (Good, robust, quality products almost indestructible). I hope that the improvement on the cable save the reputation and the performance of this tricycle.",3.0

My granddaughter loves it; she is 1 1/2. Assembly was fairly easy except that the three holes where you attach the handlebars to the vertical wooden piece simply didn't line up. I had to use a drill to enlarge the holes in the vertical wooden piece to allow the handlebar to be attached. Poor quality control.,3.0
"Hard to assemble.  Was a little disappointed with the unit.  I was able to assemble it but was the second one.  The first had problems with the steering yoke.

In terms of assembly it is PROBLEMATIC. We will end up having to super glue the seat on, because there are two screws that come with it. The one in the front penetrated the seat because the screw that came with it was too long, and the other screw in the back of the seat we cannot screw in because a standard screw driver is not long enough!",3.0
I thought you got 3 rings very deceiving...and cant pick the color :(,3.0
"After assembly, the toy is great. The wood and finish are the quality we would expect. That said, the assembly is considerable. There are 4 pre-drilled holes which were too small for the screws provided. Easy enough to fix with a drill - assuming your have one handy. The handle bar assembly is also not correctly designed and/or manufactured. There are 3 bolt/nuts but only 2 of 3 metal holes line up.",3.0

"When I received the disc I thought WOW, this is really cool.  I tried it in the back yard and it ""flew"" great - smooth, etc.  What I didn't count on was that my puppy/dog (50 lb. 8 month old) would destroy it within 10 minutes.  Obviously, it doesn't fly right now.  Shame on me - it was a bit pricey for a toy for my dog that was destroyed in 10 minutes.

If you don't plan to let your dog use it - it works nicely!",3.0
"These frisbees work well. It stinks that we weren't able to pick a color, we ended up getting a pink one delivered for our two boys to play with. It's not a huge deal because it is just a frisbee, but still, it would be nice to be able to pick your color.",3.0
"The chassis on mine was misaligned and the steering stop nub didn't align with the steering axle slot. This resulted in a very unsafe toy for my child. I caught the issue upon full assembly, so I was keen enough NOT to allow my child to use it. I worry that some parents might not even notice the issue. Please note that the steering should NOT allow for turning more than about 15 in each direction. If you can turn the steering wheel completing around or so that the front axle is parallel to the frame, then yours is also manufactured wrong. The only redeeming thing was that Radio Flyer quickly shipped me out a replacement chasis (frame) that had the proper alignment. Not sure i'd purchase any more of this brands products though.....",3.0
"My 18 month old average-size grandson was too tall for the trike.  He was disappointed as he got on it immediately. The seat height should be adjustable.  Luckily, he has a baby brother who will use it soon.",3.0
"I bought two Tiny Trikes for my twins about 10 months ago for their first birthday. The kids instantly loved their new trikes, and used them primarily indoors in a large room with hardwood floors. The trikes are very stable, and glide smoothly.  Everything was perfect until one broke; the shaft that attaches the handle bars to the trike (""upper bracket"" according to the Radio Flyer website) dislodged because the winglets that hold it in place became severed with only light usage.

The Radio Flyer website offerres replacement parts, which is great, but I am extremely disappointed that after light usage in a relatively short amount of time, it broke.  Even more disappointing is that Radio Flyer lists the part as being out of stock.

I'll just have to hide both trikes until I can get it fixed since 2 boys and one trike makes for an unpleasant afternoon...",3.0
"These discs are amazing and really easy to toss, however the big one is far superior to this smaller one.",3.0
"This toy was given to my daughter when she was little and she liked it.  Then this year we purchased one for my niece, but when my husband was putting it together, one of the parts was too short, so my husband had to disassemble my daughters old scooter and use parts from it.  We would have sent it back, but we got the scooter in the mail the day before the party so we didn't have time to send it back.  We just improvised.  I have to say we were not impressed.",3.0
"I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.

It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually.",3.0

"I was so excited to give my 1 year old her first ""bike.""  I spent 2 hours putting it together and set it out for her to play with in the morning.  Unfortunately, the only thing she's interested in is the bell.  She hasn't shown any interest in riding it, steering it or using it at all. Every time I put her on it, she climbs right off.  I'm hoping that she'll want to use it more as time passes, especially since it's so cute.",3.0
"Wonderful toy in my 15 month old's opinion.  Screws holding top of frame (with handle bars) will not stay in wood, causing numerous repairs in the first day.  Nuisance for the parents, but obviously my daughter doesn't care.  It's her favorite gift.",3.0
"I think my son was already too old or tall (at 14 months) when he got this because he's never been able to stretch out his legs and go.  He creeps along like an inch worm on it because there's no room for his legs, and his feet are always catching on the rear wheels.  He loves it though and doesn't want to ride the larger bike that I got for him.  :)",3.0
My son received this for X-mas and he really enjoys the bike.  The only problem is either the fact that the bike is very low to the ground or the handles are not high enough.  I know the bike is low for safety issues from potential tumbles but because it is so low and he is rather tall for 1 1/2 his knees are in the way when he tries to move around.  He loves to ring the bell and probably would have enjoyed even more at 1 when he was a bit shorter or if the handles were a bit higher and more out of the way.,3.0

After waiting far too long to contact the seller about the defective product, they quickly responded by sending me an entirely new set of lights without needing me to ship back my defective ones.

"I purchased 3 of these for my 5 year old triplets.
2 are still intact.  The other busted when the bike got dropped down to the ground.  It's got a rubber insert that's supposed to help make it ""hug"" the bar when you tighten it on, but sometimes it wants to squeeze right out of there and then the light starts flipping around loose.  I don't think you can get it tight enough with out this little thing.  luckily we found the one tha popped out.

"Headlight was great - until it broke. The button pushes on a little circuit that switches between the various light modes - xenon high/low and LED solid/blinking. The little circuit died, and now the only way to stop the light is to pull the batteries out. Starting it sometimes works, sometimes doesnt.

The rear light was great - until the clip broke. Just a little too flimsy.

All in all- great light, but not very great execution. Mine lasted about 8 months, I ride about 3-4 times a week.",3.0
"Headlight unit: The main bulb eats the batteries quickly, and causes the unit to fall back on the dull bulbs. You might as well immediately switch to the flickering bulbs/mode and allow the vehicles to see you that way, as the main  mode is not strong enough to satisfy your vision anyway. If you're going into a ""rural"" setting, this is NOT the unit for you. The plastic is not so strong, so one drop could be the end of the unit.

Rear light unit: has about 5 modes in which most I can't make any sense of use of them all. To turn off, you must switch through them until to you manage to get the off mode. This has taught me a lesson to buy cheaper and just get something that has one or two settings that will do the job of allowing vehicles to see you. Furthermore, the pivot/neck of the unit that allows you to adjust the unit higher or lower loses its grip quick, so you will just have to settle for the lower angle, in which the unit points down and the vehicles actually see LESS of the lights. No matter how many times I spin that knob to tighten the neck to hold still, it just loses its grip and points the unit down again. As another reviewer stated, the button is so small that you can forget about trying to hit it with gloves on.

This set does the job for city cycling, but it's much better to pay a little more or the same for one headlight and then buy a cheaper rear light that's NOT so fancy.",3.0
"The white headlight requires 4 AA batteries, and the red taillight requires 2 AAA batteries.  Batteries are not included in the package.
The plastic construction is somewhat feeble but satisfactory.  Headlight is bright enough not just to be seen, but also to see the roadway.  Headlight and taillight have various settings for brightness and blinking.
Note: When mounting, make sure to slide the headlamp or taillamp all the way in past the clicking lever on the mounting bracket, otherwise it will not be secure and will probably fall off.  Mounting the rear light upside-down works well.
The cover of the headlight is difficult to remove and replace to change/charge batteries.
Overall, I'm satisfied.  I would revise my star rating to 4 if I knew how.",3.0
"The functions for both lights are great. However, I have a hard time to put them on my new bike. Managed to do it but after a few rides, I end up having a useless headlight and lost tail light. This is due to:

1) head light only have 22 - 26 mm mounting clamp, which is good for my old road bike. My new Marin mountain bike comes with 31.8mm handle bar. Which makes it impossible to mount the head light on.

2) tail light has really bad housing design -- very easy to come apart. I lost my tail light during the last outdoor trip. This is why I am writing this review -- I am in the moment of buying another light and for sure I am not buying this one again.",3.0
"These lights work well. The brightest headlight mode will let you see well enough for night riding slowely. Not sure how long batteries will last on this mode. I use the led mode and it works fine for me at night. I see well in the dark. Some people don't. The led flashing mode is great at dusk.... Get's those drivers attention for sure. Now if they'd just watch the dam rode.....

 The rear led light works great. Bright and battery life is good.

Neither is waterproof. I put a thin plastic sandwich bag over them for riding in the rain and secure that with a ponytail tie so the rain can't enter.

 The headlight one is built very cheep so be carefull when changing batteries..... follow the directions to open it. DON'T FORCE THIS THING!! It is CHEEP.......

 I am happy with these to date, but have only had them for a few weeks.",3.0
"We use Ni-MH rechargeables, but the headlight does not play well with them. The batteries fit in the housing, but the upper, plastic cover has two ridges to help secure the batteries down; this is engineered for disposable alkaline batteries. I had to shave down the housing to create enough space for the slightly bigger rechargeable batteries.

However, the light itself is pretty good, and seems to hold up fairly well to abuse. In my urban, well lighted area, the LEDs are enough to see by and be seen by, so I can get a lot of use out of one charge. I pop the light off when I put the bike on the bus rack so that it doesn't get lost, but the holder is pretty strong.

Bell would do well to re-engineer this for Ni-MH/Ni-CD batteries.",3.0
"I used over half the bottle on my Mizuno glove, let it sit overnight, and when I used it the next day, I found that it was much softer, but still not broken in.

It just floats through the air better with less effort.",3.0
"This is a good soccer trainer that lets your kids spend more time on their footwork, and less time chasing the ball around, with the ball in a net w a leash to the waist. It's is a great concept, and there is a nice instruction book with 12 exercises suggested to improve your game, using this trainer. The belt is sturdy, with a velcro closure, which should be easy, but the plastic tab you need to pull the end through is very tight, and curiously has the leash cord permanently strung through it as well, making it tough to thread due to lack of space. Also, the belt is meant for avg. sized people- I measured the closed waistband, and it will fit a 27"" waist at the most, so just be aware of that- might be tough if you have a ""husky"" child. The primary sticking point for me on this, and one I really thought was just an incredibly poor design overall, was the small plastic piece which allows you to open and close up the netting to get your ball in and out. My kids had a hard time doing this themselves.

If you have extra balls, i'd just keep one in this net permanently and use it as the practice trainer ball set. Getting the ball in and out of the net is a time consuming effort where you have to use fine motor skills and some amount of finger strength in order to loosen the cord out of it's tight ""S"" shaped curve around the plastic columns. This would not normally be so bad, but the entire plastic piece is small, and there are two ""S"" shaped curves going in opposing directions (one for each side of the cord coming out of the ends of the net closure) packed tightly right next to each other. This certainly will prevent your ball from accidentally slipping out of the net, but you also won't easily get it out even when you want to. You almost have to be a sailor with strong tiny fingers to get these cords loose- luckily, I fit this description (just kidding). If the manufacturer could just remedy these few issues by switching out the plastic parts with more child-friendly closures, this would be a 5 star item for sure.",3.0
"Not as well made as I'd have liked, but it serves it's purpose. Instructions are not that detailed. That said,it stretches to 5 feet, fits any size ball and easily attaches to the waist. Skills it teaches include dribbling,trapping,shooting , and advanced drills. For the price it's OK.",3.0
"I bought 3 of these so my kids can practice in the yard without having to chase their balls into the street. They really enjoying them, however have a couple reasons why I'm not 100% satisfied.
1. The instructions are not as detailed as they should be. It took me quite some time to figure out how to open the net so we could put their soccer balls in. It was easy after the first one.
2. The cord keeps twisting up onto itself.  It is frustrating to have to frequently stop their practice to unwind the string.

I got what I paid for, and my kiddos will enjoy them while they last.",3.0
"We only paid $5 for this at walmart but I still wouldn't recommend.  Not easy at all to put ball in.  I bought it for my 12 year old and I think I will use an old soccer ball to keep in it because it is not an easy, quick switch to take it out or put it in.  Look for one with velcro, is what I would recommend.",3.0
A nice novelty if you never had it before....I would order it again,3.0

Is so good! but is always in 100 pieces in the package,3.0

"The ice cream was an amusing part of my daughter's space themed birthday party treats, but almost every package was full of crumbled, crushed powdery mess.  I was disappointed, but not by the quality of the product - just its fragility.",3.0
"This kind of tastes like ice cream.  Unfortunately the similarities end there.

The creamy texture that makes REAL ice cream feel good in your mouth must have been sucked out of the package along with the moisture back at the factory.

Biting down on this stuff is like biting into a hardened piece of neopolitan-flavored insulating foam.  I found it to be a pretty gross sensation and had a hard time finishing the bar.

Still, it's worth trying once!",3.0
"Bought this from Amazon for my out of state guest. They liked it a lot. only problem it does not come with home charger. charger only can hook up with car. i had to get a battery pump to pump air in it

it feels comfy when u have full air.",3.0
"Okay, first some tough love for the nubie campers: if you recall the consequences of the Ideal Gas Law from your high school physics, air volume decreases when it is cooled.  This bed holds a lot of air.  Be prepared to add some more when you wake up in the night to visit the outhouse.  Please, folks, this **does not** mean that your bed is leaking!  If you can't find a leak by submerging the mattress, you probably don't have one.

After using this product both in the woods and on the family room floor, I can say that it is competently designed.  While wiggling may disturb your partner a little, you'll both get used to it in short order.  The material is thick and won't be easily punctured.  The upper surface has a soft texture that prevents you and your mate from sliding off.  If you are careful to observe how the bed is folded as you set it up, re-rolling it will be a cinch.  The directions are printed indelibly on the pump pocket, instead of on a piece of paper that gets lost.

The pump is used for both inflating and deflating the bed.  The pump's head reattaches to the opposite pump hole when you want to reverse direction.  Powered by four D batteries, the pump does these jobs quickly without draining the batteries after one or two uses.  The bed itself is double valved, one external push-in type, and a second internal that you push the mattress nozzle against--which really helps you keep the air in when you're attempting inflation.  When you first buy the mattress, you may want to fill it up a few times and air it out so the vinyl smell dies down a bit.

The best news is that there are tents that are large enough to hold this and still not fill up the trunk of your car.  Just check tent dimensions before purchase.

Small downsides: I personally would like a more slender profile on the bed.  It is not quite large enough to naturally hold a queen size fitted sheet, so I don't see the point of making it so thick.  Less air and more internal structure would be better for camping.  Also the shipping box falls apart rather quickly--the product should come with a durable storage sack, but you'll have to supply your own.

------------------------------
Update December 2012: we've owned ours for a couple years, and it gave out one night in foul weather while camping.  We drove a long ways to buy another to replace it, but that one leaked.  We exchanged that one for a third, but that one leaked.  We have patched several holes on the first one, but can't find or plug all the leaks.  If you can visualize how hard it is to force an inflated queen-size pad into a shower stall and underwater you'll have a better notion of the frustration.  The second and third ones were bought in Canada, so they may be off of a different manufacturing line.  I presume most of the issues are from manufacturing flaws and degradation of the material over time.  The bottom line is I am downgrading this from four stars to three, and was tempted to go to two stars given the limited life span.  We've now switched to Alps Mountaineering pads.",3.0
"For the price this is a decent mattress.  The pump works great and is fast- minutes.
The flocked covering makes it nice so the sheets don't slide off and it is quiet. I think the air chambers make it more supportive than other air mattresses.  It did not leak. But it still is an air mattress, it's more comfortable for one. When two people are on it feels like the sides are pushing up, maybe it would be better with less air in it.  Also with all air beds if you toss and turn the bed bounces, can't get around that.
Overall it was good",3.0
"Within 8 hours of sleeping, the brand-new bed was deflated by 10%-20% - a very noticeable amount.  I don't think it has a manufacturing defect.  I think the seal just isn't very good.

Also, even with fresh batteries, the battery-pump can't make the bed super-firm.  I would advice getting an extra plug-in pump for use when you're at home because the battery-pump just isn't strong enough.

Other than that, it's a comfortable bed, and it stores easily and nicely in the built in bag.",3.0
"This is a good mattress for an over-nighter at someone's house or a 1-2 day camping excursion, but that's it. If you plan on using it for a longer period than that, you may experience back pain. With two adults, you'll definitely loose air; kids might fair better. I also own the double high version of this matress -- and I highly recommend that version instead. It's a little bit more money, but I sleep better on that than my Cal King at home. From an economic stand point this queen-sized quickbed is a good deal, but spend the extra $30-$40 if you've got it for a much better night sleep.",3.0
"This is a nice, inexpensive solution when you have excess guests and need an extra bed. The pump isn't quite strong enough to inflate it so that the mattress is firm, and it requires 4 D batteries (sold separately). As is, with two adults on the somewhat under-inflated mattress, it can be a little wobbly if you get too close to the edge. The 4D pump does a nice job of deflating it when it's time to put it away. Rolls up nicely into an attached case with ties for storage.

3 stars because of comfort & pump strength. I would imagine that the plug-in version of the pump might have the power to inflate the mattress better.",3.0
"I purchased this for many reasons, one being that this was an ""all in one"" with the pump and ""wrap n roll"" storage, etc... which I could not find on the shelf at the stores.  This was an ""ok"" purchase.  But I would spend more on a better bed and purchase the pump separately... just to not have to be re-filling the bed with air consistently.  I sent the first one back (my friends had to wake up in the middle of the night to re-fill the bed with air) and the replacement was better, but it leaked too (but you can't hear the leak... it just goes flat... the replacement would last a day rather than needing overnight refills).  I've never been disappointed with ANYTHING Coleman prior to this purchase.  I wish I could say it is better than it is, but it's just ""ok"" for the product and the price.  Probably worth paying more or checking another product line (I also thought this would be a better purchase based on other reviews... everyone else seemed to have better luck with this than I did... maybe a 3rd try would have been a charm?).",3.0
"This product works fine.  The pump is great.  But like any air-mattress, it deflates after laying on it for a while.  I usually just fill it up once a day and that is sufficient.  So far, no problems.  I am a satisfied customer.  Love the roll-up case that it has built in.",3.0
"I works, but you know, it is a lot louder than the one I had (battery failed)...plus, I prefer black, red looks a little toy-like.  Oh well, it pumps and sucks, so cant complain.",3.0
"Good pump, but has issues.  Others have mentioned that the battery, after a while, will no longer take a charge.  In my case, I didn't even get that far:  the electrical receptacle in the back of the pump, into which one inserts the AC adapter, became loose disappeared into the pump.  It could no longer be charged and, therefore, died forever soon after.  I couldn't find a way to open it to repair it, so the rather high price of this model became a loss after not much time.  I replaced it with the much less expensive Quick Pump, to which the AC cord is permanently attached.",3.0
Worked well in the beginning. After a while it stopped charging.,3.0
It works fine.  Just don't misplace the charger.  Be prepared for the noise.  Fills an air mattress in just a couple seconds.  I wouldn't have bought it if I had known that the hand pump I had would work.  In filling the Coleman air mattress I have the entire air valve has to be pulled out or it won't inflate.,3.0
"At the beginning it was not charging. It took way over the 10 hours advertised in the box. I am thinking the battery was somewhat so drained that it took WAAAAY longer to charge it.
It inflates one queen mattress barely. I needed to inflate 2. Luckily I have a manual pump as well.",3.0
"I bought this after our last pump died. It is a great pump that last long on one charge. BUT it only lasted us one season as we left it in the garage for the winter and the rechargeable battery (cannot be taken out and replaced) was shot from the cold. (Odd because we have a Coleman rechargeable lantern that has spent 10 winters in the garage and still works.) It can only be plugged in to AC outlet to recharge - would've preferred a car charger adapter model, but it wasn't available at the time.",3.0

Based on the other reviews here, I'm wondering if mine is defective.  If you care to watch the review video, you can see what the product is like and hear what mine sounds like.  Some reviews talk about this pump being quiet; to me this pump is quite loud, at least as loud as my mid-size shopvac.  I was very pleased with the units performance early on, but after using it for about 6 nights of camping (filling an air mattress) it seems the battery now will only last about 4 minutes with a full charge.  Also the plug on the back of the unit seem to have broken off internally and it's difficult to connect the wall charger now because of how loose it is.  As you can see in the video, there is no external damage to the unit and I've been careful with it, I'm not sure that I did anything that could have caused this damage (it's never been dropped or banged around at all).",3.0
"The pump works well if it is fully charged.  However, it has a fatal design flaw: it works only by battery, even when plugged in to the wall.  That means if the pump has not been charged beforehand, your're sleeping on a hard surface, even if you have access to an outlet.",3.0
"I purchased one of these for my brother and one for myself.  We each have two sets of the Coleman 4 in 1 Quickbeds that we use for occasional guests in our home without a second bedroom set up.  Having a specialized pump like this makes the job of inflating 2-4 mattresses much quicker than doing it with a pool toy or bicycle pump and the added benefit of being able to use the pump to deflate the mattresses fully before rolling them up is also very nice.  I chose a Rechargeable for the convenience of being able to use it without an outlet close but I haven't had the pump long enough to comment on the durability of the battery.  For the price and my intended uses, I feel like I got a good deal.",3.0
"Purchased it 10 years ago, used it about once/year since, front plastic connector broke last year and completely today.  No response to on/off switch or charger.  Minimal ability to debug w/o taking it apart and inspecting electronics.  Will not buy again.",3.0
It serves the purpose I need it for and when I need it while camping on the beach. Rechargeable is great,3.0
"this blower is very loud,it works great,just very loud,i think it maybe defective,my nephew has 1 and its not this loud",3.0
I purchased this pump to replace one that I had purchased years ago.  This new one is much louder and seems to be made a little cheaper.  Works goods but is LOUD!,3.0
"This is the newest incarnation of Coleman's Rechargeable QuickPump. I've had two nearly identical models over the last 8 years. I was hoping they improved it to be quieter, but not at all. Maybe worse. (I checked. Wal-Mart has it.)

The noise level can be annoying in your back yard or home. More so at a campsite where people are trying to get away from noisy and rude. To me, its piercing whine screams ""careless design.""

Consider using a good quality foot pump (good ones can cost $40). They never run out of juice, although they're not as fast or easy.

I don't use the ""deflation feature."" Large-valve mattresses will self deflate in a few minutes.

PROs:

~~> Fast inflation of ""Boston valve"" type mattresses, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intex-Downy-Twin-Bed/dp/B000HBO4M2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intex Downy Twin Bed</a>
~~> You don't have to feed it batteries, like the D-cell version
~~> Coleman now sells replacement nozzles at their site. This bumps my review up to 3-stars

CONs:

~~> Noisy, rude.
~~> Limited capacity in wilderness (probably about 10-12 twin size mattress inflations)
~~> Manual asks you to ""recharge every 3-5 months, even if not used"" (Not convenient.)
~~> No case (cheap soft-sided cooler or lunch box works well)",3.0
"This pump is likely fine for Coleman beds, but I bought it for the ""fits other brands and items"".

Sadly,  every airbed manufacturer seems to design their own, custom fill-vent.  The Coleman was a full .5"" too small (diameter) to work with my Simmons and wouldn't fit my Aerobed either.

The battery is a lead one, and not light.  The quickpump running without a bed attached also seemed to be twice as noisy versus the 120V plug-in charger for the Simmons bed-- very much not quiet.

For my purposes, and because of the noise level, Not Recommended.  Coleman bed owners who don't mind the noise may be ok.",3.0
"I purchased this item some time ago, it works well and the charge stays with it a long time but it is a little weak; I use it for my inflatable kayak and always need to finish the job using the foot pump becasue this thing can't provide enough pressure. It does save a lot of leg work though!",3.0
"Generally satisfied. The deflating side works very well; much better than trying to squeeze the air out. Inflation is somewhat slower than I had hoped and the pointed attachment does not open some of the flapper valves, requiring squeezing them. Portability without extension cords is a big plus.",3.0

"The dartboard is very robust and I really love its quality. However, the darts that came with it are of bad quality. Within the first few throws, the plastic end of of the darts broke apart. Even for other darts, the openings to insert the detachable flaps are of bad quality too. They don't hold the flaps well making them come off on every throw. Overall, I'm left with bad experience because of these darts. Please try to improve their quality in future.",3.0
the darts broke so fast that I had to buy more in less than 5 hours of use. the actual board is not bad but is not the best either. the wires are rounded so darts tend to rebound from them.,3.0
All parts arrived perfect. After shooting darts two weekends in a row the darts fell apart. They are terrible and not good at all. They bounce back. The heads fly off causing inaccurate shots. Board is good. I had to readjust the wire and hammer in the staples. ....for the money i guess you get what you pay for...,3.0
"Not too bad. I agree with a few reviews on here... it's not the GREATEST quality. I've only played a few rounds with it and it looks prett beat up. Almost like it's not tight enough. A few times, darts will bounce out of the board and fly off to the side as if the board didn't grip the point of the dart. Also, it has three rubber feet to keep it from being wobbly. I needed to put some shims (bottle caps) behind it at four points to keep it from moving around. The darts already broke... from falling out if the board And hitting the floor. Seems like an ok first dart board.  If my family uses it a lot, I'll need to purchase a new/better one.",3.0
"The dart board is great; its very heavy and good quality, but the packaging was damaged which resulted in some broken dart shafts.",3.0
"It's a dart board.. Nothing really special about it.  One thing is for sure according to all the reviews I read, it definitely is NOT self healing... I wouldn't recommend a dart enthusiast to buy this one but the casual player like myself won't mind it",3.0
I see why it comes with a dart set. I like to use a more heavy gram dart set and they don't seem to want to stick. keep having them bounce out. Im not sure if its defective or thats just how this board works but i can tell you its not self healing. the pic below is after the first night of 301.,3.0
"The board is That said, they shouldn't have even bothered with the garbage darts. I've only played a handful of games and 5 of the 6 darts are broke already.",3.0

"As we read in the reviews, the darts they come with the set are not the best. Otherwise, weve been happy with the board.",3.0
"I like the product, but two of the darts broke in half during the first use.  Easy to buy more, but low quality darts.",3.0
"This dart board is great quality, however, there are WAY too many bounce outs. About 1 in every dozen throws results in a bounce out. Good for beginners, practice and at home use. Do not recommend for competition.",3.0
"The dart board is beefy and solid.  The darts are not.  The cheap plastic on 2 of the 6 darts snapped off on the first use.  If you're going to buy this board,  order sombre extra darts as well.",3.0
"At times the old adage ""You get what your pay For"".  In this Case for the price it is a good Dart Board.  After using it and trying to get back into competitive dart throwing I really need one that the separator wires are flat and not round.  When your darts hit on of the round wires it bounces back.  Thus loosing whatever points you were trying to get.  My next one will be the one with Flat separator wires.",3.0
"I would purchase this board w/much caution.  If you read the fine print carefully, it states staple free bulls eye to reduce bounce back and that is true.  HOWEVER, rest of the board causes/creates excessive bounce backs and the so-called ""self-healing"" material fails to deliver.  There are much better options out there in the same price range.  Good luck and Happy Throwing.",3.0

"The board itself is VERY nice, and I suppose I should write a review because really this is a ""board with FREE darts"".  Since this was intended to be a kit, I will also review the darts - which are crap.  3 of them broke in the first few rounds of using them and I've had to replace them.

So, board is fine, Darts suck",3.0
"Good board for the money, I guess.  Its a lower end bristle type board. We have used it a few times, and its already showing a lot of the holes.

"This was a last minute gift for a close guy friend, otherwise, I would've returned it flat out. When the product box got to me it had a 2 inch hole where something had pressed and dug into it. Like I said, as it was last minute and for a good friend, I gently felt around inside to make sure nothing else was damaged, taped the cardboard back down, and wrapped it up. However, upon receiving and opening the gift, the dartboard looked like it had been previously used. The black painted wood around the outer rim of the board had some dents and scratches and the playing area had pin hole marks and indentations where darts had been. I didn't read anywhere in the product description that this was, or potentially could be, a used board. Luckily, my guy friend was really good-natured and just excited to play darts. 3 stars because the product is well constructed, easy to use/assemble, looks good, and aside from basically giving someone a used gift, I would purchase it again -allowing for the time it would take to return should it come in the same condition.",3.0
"The darts that come with this dartboard are not good and not worth it.  For me they all broke within 3 weeks of average use and I had to buy higher quality replacement darts.  Also it does seems like the darts bounce off this board more than I've seen with other boards.  I'd say the quality is OK but not great.  The setup was easy at least.  Overall this is one of the lesser quality dartboards I've seen, but still a step up from a wood one.",3.0
"The dart board was good, about what you would expect.

The darts were awful.  Six darts came with the board, 2 showed up broken and three more broke during the first game of cricket.  I have played a lot of darts and looking closer into the dart, the plastic is very weak on the tail.  One bounce out with this dart and it will most likely snap the plastic where the steel case meets the plastic.",3.0
board is great. darts are great only it came with only 3 darts. so 3 stars on the review,3.0
It was a gift. It arrived on time. No complaints from the receiver. They already had one.,3.0
"The wiring that divides up the spaces is fairly thick. Even though this board is a lot of fun and well built, a little bit more than occasionally the darts will hit the wire and bounce back.",3.0
"Sometimes darts backfire, but majority of the time they'll stick in. The material could have been a tad denser.",3.0
"For only $22 this is a great board that comes with 2 sets of beginner darts. Not too much to complain about but I'll be sending it back for the Blade 4. I played for about an hour and had at least 10-15 bounce outs, if not more. One of em stuck in the ground about 6"" from my foot. For $40 more I think it's just worth it to get the Winmau if you're going to play more than once or twice a week. Besides, for the amount of time you're going to own the board, 40 bucks means nothing.

Other than the bounce outs the board seems fine but doesn't seem to heal too well so not too sure about longevity. If you're on a tight budget go for it but I'd recommend investing a little more and protecting your darts.",3.0
"Board arrived fast and seems to bw good quality unfortunately i received a defective one that has a damage spot on the 9, 19, and 1 spots.",3.0
Darts have held up. Holes are not self healing.,3.0
"This is a good beginner's board, worth about the $23 I paid for it. Yes, the holes do not heal and I've had more than usual bounce outs.
If you are a serious player then I would stay away and pay the extra $ for a blade 4 or a dart world board.",3.0
Overall I'm ok with the item. I ended up using my own screws to mount directly onto wall. The mounting screws that came with dart board were too short to grab onto the stud. Also one of the darts was unusable upon receipt. The plastic shaft too loose and does thread into metal tightly.,3.0

"I got the board as part of a package deal with one of Viper's cabinets.

I can't say it's particularly good quality. The paint job is bad with color overlaps and thicker/thinner areas of paint. The wires are very thick causing LOTS of bounceouts, and they also aren't all that evenly spaced. The double bull isn't centered in the bullseye. The sisal is not very good quality, doesn't heal very well, and shows lots of wear very quickly. I rotate the board 1-2x/week and it still shows far too much wear.

Not a very good board by any measure. It does the job if you're not serious about playing, but the wires are soooooo thick and the sisal gets worn/damaged very quickly. I play every day for 1-2 hours and I don't think the board will last more than month. It may be better for you, but not so good for me.",3.0
i love them but they were pretty big in size returned them and ordered a size 3 normally wear a 4,3.0
Some of the writing is faded and the bull's eye is missing some of the red paint/color which makes it hard to see. Very heavy.,3.0
I have yet to open the package. Upon receiving the package it was smashed and open already. This is a gift for my husband and it looks like garbage already. Let's hope the actual product is worth keeping.,3.0
It's as cheap as it is priced. one of the three rubber teats on the back broke off & the bracket was bent when it arrived. The darts are as cheap as the board with as much as 0.2 grams difference between them in weight. I wanted a cheap board for practicing at home & that's exactly what I got.,3.0
Skates were a great price but were marked like new. They were very dirty and had some scuff marks when we got them so they should not have been marked like new.,3.0

"These are just okay. My 4.5 year old is starting to get in to skating, so I ordered these for her. Compared to the brown rink skates, they are much harder to skate in and go much slower. They have really cheap wheels and bearings that don't spin freely, even when adjusted. I think my daughter is already better than the skates and she is only 4. I can't imagine that older kids would like them. I wish I had just saved the $$ and sprung for a better pair. Some of the other brands at a similar price point seem like they have better wheels.",3.0
The dartboard was very easy to setup and I started testing it out right afterwards. The only problem with this board is that healing is super slow and leaves marks all the time. The darts that come with this thing are useless and you have to purchase your own to get any good use out of them. If they included better darts and healing then this board would have gotten the full stars.,3.0
"Board is solid, but paint on siding chipped off before unpacked and one of the included darts broke into three pieces within one week of use.",3.0
"Title says it all.  Broke two (2) of six (6) darts where the plastic meets the stainless steel---the plastic simply cracked.  That was on first day of use/Christmas.  Plastic broke upon darts hitting floor.  Should this happen?  I think not.

Not worth the effort to try to get replacements....I'll just learn next time.  BUY COMPONENTS SEPARATELY.",3.0
"The board seems good and playable.  I would definitely buy it again for the price ($20-ish), but you need to be a little handy and not too finicky to appreciate it's value.
Packaging came dented and one dart broken (plastic threads stripped out).
Paint quality on the board OK, but not perfect--- a little was chipped off right out of the box, but not a significant issue.

Mounting--you are on your own to figure this out:
You should pilot-drill the back of the board since it is particle board (otherwise it would shatter or not hold the threads well). 3 rubber bumpers with 3 tiny nails also come with the kit --the rubber feet but are too large for the gap between the board and wall--I just used some (a few layers may be needed) single-sided-sticky foam tape to pad/shim the back of the board against the wall--worked fine.

LAST TIP: (not nice looking, just practical)--I got a large flattened cardoard box and used the dart board to draw a circle in the center, which I then cut out.  I just hung this flattened box over the board to protect the wall from stray darts.  After the first use it saved about 20 dart holes to the basement wall.  You can always use something nicer, but since you can just take this off easily and put it away when not in use, it's not a bad way to go for kids who really don't care what the wall looks.",3.0
"The set itself is a great deal, but I am slightly disappointed:
1) by the bounce outs. Not a ton, but frequently enough
2) by the quality of the darts. It came with 6, and I've broken 2 after a month of standard use

The board itself I can live with, but I'll need to purchase a couple sets of more permanent darts to replace those that were provided.",3.0
"Got this for my sons birthday. He was thrilled with it, but I didn't like the deep cracks in the board. My husband hung it up before I got a chance to return it. No one else is bothered by cracks and it works just fine.",3.0
"I have mine setup in my garage and we play almost every night.  I thought bounce outs were normal but after having so many happen I really needed a change.  What's even worse is this board seems to have more bounce outs on the bullseye than anything else.  Not to mention after the steel tip dart bounces out it continues on it's warpath of destruction to take a dent out on my concrete floor.  My darts have become dull and after purchasing new dart of better quality these bounce-outs are not exactly what you're looking for on $30+ set of darts.

A friend had purchased the Winmau Blade 4 after getting into the dart throwing game and that board is a dream.  It cost a little bit more but it is by far worth the money.  I have just purchased a Blade 4 to replace the shot king.

Again, this isn't a bad board but you'll get 8-10 bounce outs in a 30 minute throwing session which is basically unacceptable.  Especially after buying lighter darts ""which I like"" they tend to not stay in very well and just fall out sometimes.

Playing on my friends Winmau 4 you're lucky to get one bounce out in a hour of play.

Treat yourself and treat your floors, Buy the Winmau Blade 4, do not settle for the shot king if you are trying to be serious.",3.0
"The product definitely doesn't close the holes very well, as a matter of fact, if you throw the dart hard, to make sure it goes straight, it leaves a dent in the board. 3 darts broke within 30 minutes, one hit the metal and landed on the floor snapping the plastic fin, one hit another on the board and snapped the plastic fin, and another i don't remember. You have to screw the hanger on the back which i guess is a good thing, but I'd prefer it coming put together",3.0
The only issue I have is that the board doesnt seem to heal as well as it should.  This could be due to the fact that the bristles seem to be dried out.,3.0
The board is very heavy. The darts broke in couple of days. But the quality of board is very good.,3.0
"The wires will cause your darts to bounce out, its very annoying, especially the wire around the bulls eye.. I have thrown darts for years and I couldn't throw them as hard as usual, they would bounce right out, doesn't hold the steel tips very well. I didn't have to buy it, I play at a friends house but have used it more than enough to write an accurate review.",3.0
"Got some enjoyment out of this board before it wore out. Staples began popping out over time and the board material began cracking and pushing out into a convex shape (possibly due to warm dry air in the winter).

Would probably last longer in a better controlled environment but can't complain for the price.",3.0
"Price was great but after a month of playing just on weekends, we have a bent wire & the left side of board seems to be weaker cork. The dart tip goes in all the way",3.0
"I chose this dartboard because of the excellent reviews and low price. The colors, thickness and quality of the bristle is fine. Upon receipt, the bullseye area was compressed where the wires enter it, definitely a defect and a result of thick wires.

The wires are too thick and poorly anchored. Because the wire is rounded and thick, many bounce outs occur... especially when aiming for the bullseye, where there are many wires converging on a small area.

The bullseye is my biggest complaint. The wires are loose and have de-lodged from the bullseye. This happened within a few weeks of use!!! (see my photos)

I would not recommend this item, but for $25 it is hard to pass up.",3.0
"Board is nice Bristle Quality very good

but there are a lot of bounceouts

not sure if it is the wires or something else

still a VERY NICE BOARD",3.0
"SORRY I CANNOT PUT MORE THAN 3 STARS ON THIS TYPE OF DARTBOARD, SPECIALLY WHEN VIPER EVEN RATED THIS BOARD AS THEIR 3-STARS DARTBOARD... IT MIGHT BE A 3.5 STARS EVEN 4 BECAUSE OF THE PRICE I PAID, I HAVE IT ON SALE FOR (24.99+PRIME)AND THE SISAL BOARD QUALITY... IS JUST EXCELLENT... NOT TOO SOFT AND NOT TO HARD EITHER THEY ALSO SAID THAT YOU CAN USE A SOFT TIP DARTS ON IT... WHICH IS A GOOD FEATURES...

I PUT 3 STARS ONLY AT ONE THING... THE METAL FRAME THAT SEPARATES THE COLORS (DOUBLE/TRIPLE/BULLS AND CHERRY)... SOME OTHER PEOPLE'S REVIEWS SAY'S IT DOESN'T BOUNCE THAT MUCH AND SOME SAID IT IS... BUT THE TRUTH IS, THE ANSWER IS HIDDEN BEHIND THAT WIRES... TRY ZOOMING AND COMPARING THE THICKNESS OF THE WIRES FROM EACH DARTBOARD AVAILABLE ON AMAZON... AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS ONE IS ON THE TOP 3 DARTBOARDS THAT HAS A ROUND AND HAS A THICKER METAL FRAMING... NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE % OF HOW MUCH IT BOUNCE... THAT'S ALL DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD YOU ARE AND HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET YOUR DART PINS ON YOUR AIMING SHOTS... BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ALREADY A SHARP SHOOTER, MEANING IF UR AIMING SHOT IS ALWAYS INSIDE OF YOUR IMAGINARY 2 INCHES DIAMETER SPOT... THEN CHANCES OF HITTING THE METAL FRAME WOULD BE SKY HIGH SPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO HIT THE BULLS AND THE TRIPLES...EVEN THE CHERRY STAMPED FRAME  IS ALSO A LITTLE THICKER THAN OTHERS AND ITS STICKING OUT A LITTLE TOO, SO IF YOU THROW DARTS IN ANGLES MEANING MORE OR LESS THAN 90 DEGREE'S IN ANGLES... YOUR CHANCES OF HITTING THAT FRAME AGAIN WOULD BE HIGHER... AND ALL OF THESE DESCRIPTION IS APPLICABLE TO ANY OF ALL COMPARED DARTBOARD THAT HAS SAME OR SIMILAR THICKNESS AND ROUND METAL FRAMING, WHICH IS EVEN SOME OF IT THAT COST $49.99 DOLLAR ONES HAS ALMOST THE SAME THICKNESS AND ROUND METAL FRAMING (MEANING THEY WERE ALSO RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NO DIFFERENCE ON A $49 DOLLAR DARTBOARD) BECAUSE OF THAT METAL FRAMING...

PROS AND CONS...

IF YOU REGULARLY PRACTICE AND THROWING DARTS I SUGGEST THAT YOU GET THE SHARPER METAL FRAMING ONES POINTED METAL EDGES FRAME... OR SHARP EDGES FRAME... LIKE WINMAU BLADE IV OR A MUCH CHEAPER BANDIT DARTBOARD SUPER THIN WIRE AND STAMPED FREE FROM DMI... IM NOT A DEALER ON BOTH OF THOSE COMPANY'S BUT I FOUND THEIR DARTBOARD BETTER THAN THIS ONE... SORRY VIPER... I KNOW YOU'RE HIGHER END ONES ARE GREAT TOO... BUT WITH THE DIFFERENCE OF MAYBE $15-$20 BUCKS I RATHER PAY TO GET THOSE THIN OR SHARPER EDGE METAL FRAME ONES RATHER THAN PICKING UP MY HIGH END DART PINS ON THE FLOOR EVERY 2-3 MINUTES BECAUSE I BEEN HITTING THE FRAMES...

IN OVER ALL THESE BOARD IS NOT BAD AT ALL... NOT TIL YOU TURN PRO... THATS WHEN YOU GONNA NEED THOSE GOOD EDGES BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE MISS IS A COUNT...",3.0

"The skates are cute, but my 6 year old daughter hates them. The wheels are hard & barely turns. She said they aren't fast enough. I think they are great skates for a child that has never had skates before. I had to purchase big girl skates, a week later. So for me it was a waste of money ;(",3.0
"Skates are super cute with pink and periwinkle wheels. My daughter is 7 and skating lots- asked rink to loosen wheels so they go faster, said they can't go any looser...and that is why they are inexpensive. Good for beginner skaters but would not recommend for kids who will skate frequently. After a month I already feel she has outgrown the ""speed"" of them.",3.0
Had to return.,3.0
"Normally when I go roller skating at a rink I get a size 7 so I ordered a size 7. I wish I would have gotten a 6 though because they're pretty large on my foot. It's definitely something easy to deal with though, I just added a insole and two pairs of socks and I'm good to go. Also the insole I added was for arch support because without it I noticed my arches woul start cramping and with it the problem is solved. Wheels and bearings aren't too bad if you aren't looking to go fast anf you're just starting to learn. They worked for me at first, but now I feel I need something faster so I ordered new wheels and bearings. The rest of the boot is pretty substantial, not too much to complain about. So just somethings to keep in mind when purchasing.",3.0
The looked great. My kids were told by their instructor that these were not good quality skates so we returned them.,3.0

This is a good compass for someone like myself with no sense of direction.  It works well the second time around.  The first one I received was dead on arrival.

Broken within a couple months of using.  They were worn about 8 times.,3.0
When I first got them I was so excited about them but when I got them on the floor my right skate seem so roll off to the right more. My other skater friends told me I just had to break them in but one guy looked at them and found out that my barring's were bad. I was really upset because I did understand why because I hadn't skated in them long.,3.0
My advice is to change the wheels and bearing on these as soon as you get them. Feels like skating in mud right out of the box.,3.0
these run super huge and I ordered 2 sizes smaller then I usually am and they fit perfect. I don't like them for a roller rink because the wheels stuck. the customer service to return them was awesome though.,3.0

ONE OF THE GUY WORKING FOR ROLLER MAGIC  TOLD ME ABOUT THE SKATE WAS FALLING APART .. HE PUT IT BACK TOGETHER .. I COULD'VE GIVE THEM 4 STARS BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER COMPLAIN FROM MY OLDER DAUGHTER SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT UNSTABLE .. SO I THINK WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING CHEAP DON'T EXPECT TO BE PERFECT. I PAID ALMOST $45 FOR THEM THEY ARE CHEAP BUT NOT SO MUCH I THINK SO ...,3.0
"I bought these skates for my birthday skate night. I turned 35 and I like to skate once in a while and I was so tired of using rental skates. I also bought one size DOWN because the other reviews said to do so. They were right. I wear a 8 1/2 - 9 so I bought an 8 and it fit just right. The skates actually skated fine at the skate rink but I did notice that the wheels didn't give me the speed I wanted or the glide. I had to work harder to get the speed. While at the skating rink, I  met the guy that taught my MOM how to skate. My mom (55) skates better (and more often) than me. And the guy looked at my skates and said it's a good body, and after messing with my wheels, he said the wheels and barron (skate talk) are CRAP! So he suggested I get new wheels if I really want to skate like I do... but that is going to run me about $115!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I might save up for it because I love to skate and I want to get better. So, the skates are  nice, but I do  not get the speed I wanted.",3.0
"I ordered these rollerskates to skate on in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and they were great going down the smooth surface of Central Park West, but once the parade hit the rough asphalt of 42nd Street on our way to Herald Square the front two wheels on my right foot came loose! Luckily, they held on long enouch for me to do a few loops around Johnny Weir in front of Macy's but I'll need a wrench to repair them before their next performance. Very cute though and I thought the sizing was only a half size off.",3.0
"love the pink and white.  The breaks weren't rubber they were like this hard plastic.  When I had to used the breaks I wore down 1/4 of the tip.  Kinda scary.  I also read some one's review that the sizes were running big.  My shoe size is 8, however i really needed a size 6.  something to consider before purchasing.  I also found them cheaper at Big 5 Sporting Goods.  Sad about that too.",3.0
"The wheels are very slippery and I do not recommend them for indoor use.  As stated in previous reviews, order a size smaller than you usually wear. My shoe size is a 10 and I can almost wear an 8 in these skates.  Once I replace the wheels to a higher quality they will be great.",3.0
"The skates were pretty to look at but the boot and wheels were too plastic.  But i guess for the price i paid they would have to do.  Besides, the recipient enjoyed them, who happens to be a 9 year old girl that is just beginning to roll!",3.0

"My daughter squealed with delight as she opened these skates as a gift for her eighth birthday. Mission accomplished.

The construction is heavy. The design is retro, and resembles something from the Soviet Union or North Korea. The style is so basic, and even the packaging seems unimaginative. She wanted quad skates in a girlie color, so this is it.

"Good Volleyball for its price. It tends to be pretty hard, and not soft as some of the regular volleyballs. I've gotten consistent comments from friends that its a lot harder than normal volleyballs and hurts their arms. Also it is pretty well inflated if not a bit over inflated. Other than that, I'd say it is good for the price you pay. It'd be nicer if it were softer!",3.0
Cute but hard as a rock,3.0

"They are OK in a quick pinch, but would recommend something different for long term safety.  By all means I am not a locksmith, but have been known to pick a lock here and there, and thought that I would give these locks a quick try.  Opened them in less than 5 min with minimal effort.  My kids are 8 & 9 years old and I don't have to worry about them at this point; these locks should be sufficient for now.  I would not; however, recommend these on semi-automatic weapons as you can easily chamber a round with one of these locks applied, and with pulling hard enough on the lock backwards you can fire the weapon.  I cannot get this lock to install behind the trigger on my S&W M&P Shield 45, only in front.  I use a wire lock instead.",3.0
"They're solid and, if you put them on correctly, can definitely prevent someone from randomly picking up a weapon and using it.
I got them as a lock picking challenge and they serve that purpose readily as they've proven fun and instructional for various people to pick.
If you had kids around who can play with tools, hopefully, an actual weapon would be out of their reach but these shouldn't be your single line of defense.
Note: If you install them wrong, you can push on the lock to discharge the weapon! Read and follow the instructions.",3.0
"These locks are enormous and very rugged. From a manufacturing point of view they are quite well made, but from a functional point of view they are a bit of a failure. The bolt that goes through the lock is so thick it does not seem to fit behind most triggers, and putting the bolt in FRONT of the trigger is extremely dangerous! I was able to manipulate the lock into pulling on the trigger even while locked very tightly.",3.0
"Seems as though Master Lock quality has diminished over the years.  They may still meet their standards, but clearly not as good as the same as what I bought in the 1990's.  It was to the point of my wanting to write the company.  Key is much thinner and narrower, and the lock itself just does not seem as 'tight' of a product.  Once engaged in the trigger well, however, it performs as would be expected which is ultimately the critical aspect to its function.",3.0
"This set isn't bad - particularly given the low price. I don't have three firearms but plan to fill out a collection so I thought the 3-pack was a good deal. I'm guessing for a pistol or rifle this is a good device, but for a Remington 1100 shotgun it was tricky to lock up. Unlike some other locks this one ""clamps"" on ratchet-style - that's a good thing. It doesn't matter what thickness your receiver is, this will fit almost anything.

The trouble is its shape. It has these small plastic pins that seem designed to fit any curve in the trigger guard area, but also a rubber wedge-shaped piece that looks like it's meant to grab the edge of the trigger and keep the lock from being moved around. The way it's laid out I can see it working well on a pistol, but it was REALLY hard to get it aligned well on my Remi where a strong kid or determined adult couldn't move it around quite a bit. I don't think you could fire it easily with it on there, but it's not as secure as I'd like. I'm keeping it, but to be honest if I had known all this I might have kept looking at other options...",3.0

I got rid of them and switched back to cable locks, which actually prevent the weapon from being loaded, and I will be buying the Gun Vault dummy mag for my Stag.  With the trigger locks, you are still able to load the weapon, and if you want you can jam the trigger lock down hard won to fire the weapon.  None of my guns were able to fit the lock bar behind the trigger, as the space behind the trigger on all my guns is less than 1/4 inch, and the bar is thicker than that.  Hope you enjoy.",3.0

"The Master Gun Lock does secures most firearms very well but is a little hard to install on some.

Since every firearm should be mechanically secured this is am easy way to do this. Keys are always a problem and are small. Knowing kids, they will find keys and firearms so a combination safe is in my opinion the best primary security.

Keeping the individual firearm locked is a secondary safety feature and reminds the person handling the firearm of safety. A trigger lock is not recommended for use on any loaded firearm and may not prevent it from cycling or firing.",3.0

"This lock set is exactly what you need for child proofing or amateur thieves.  However, do not expect more than that.  Yes, they are built by a quality manufacturer, but if you are seeking greater protection, seek a more expensive, specialty lock.  For example, this lock will not secure firmly around a black rifle winter trigger guard - you only have to pivot the lock and push the pin out of the trigger guard to remove the lock (30 seconds) - in one piece, without harming the rifle.  This lock works better on shotguns.  I rated this as 3 stars only because the descriptions should have been more detailed on what type of trigger guards it protects.",3.0

"""The only problem I had was the tandem seat is actually smaller then the original seat I got with the Kettler Air Navigation Trike. Since the tandem seat is for the child that is in the front (typically the older child), I was a little concerned she wouldn't fit on the seat as well.""",3.0
"We bought this insert to go on an Air Navigator.  As other reviewers have mentioned, not all Kettler trikes can use this insert.  Check with the manufacturer's site, e.g. [...] to be sure.

My one complaint with this product is that it is too short.  This insert connects between your existing seat and your existing handlebars, so the red seat pictured here becomes the front seat.  The trouble is that the insert, when positioned for maximum leg length of the pedaler, is at a shorter distance then when the trike without the insert is set up for maximum leg length.

So imagine your older child, who needs to be in front because he/she can pedal, and the younger is in back.  It makes sense that the older child needs more leg room, so you would expect at least that the insert should give you the same maximum leg length to the front rider as the trike normally does when you remove the insert.  Sadly this is not the case.  Maybe it sets up differently on other Kettrikes, but on the Air Navigator, this is how it is.  I think this is a most unfortunate design flaw.

That said, it is not a show-stopper.  There is still enough room to pedal, but it is obviously suboptimal.  The kids love it.",3.0
"the sunnto observer provides a wealth of info for you outdoor adventures from a compass to a barometer even an altimeter, the only problem is it is difficult to read unless you're reading it from a specific angle, what you see on the picture is NOT how the display looks like when you have it on. other than that, it's a solid watch that should bring years of service, if only....",3.0
"This watch is really a great watch. I was issued this while in the military and it worked like a champ for the 5 years I owned it. The backlight is very unique in the sense that instead of the back of the face lighting up and the readings staying black it is the opposite which is something I really appreciated while out on missions. The compass was good enough to give you a good sense of direction and keep you going on the right vector, but I still relied on my pocket compass to do my land nav. I never really used the barometer or altimeter settings, so I can't really comment on those. The thermometer was really pretty accurate and if you look at temp reading while on your wrist I had to remember that it wasn't going to be spot on due to my body temp.

The worst thing about this watch was it's strap. I'm talking in the past tense because I just lost the watch yesterday. I have already replaced the strap (about a year and a half ago) and it broke again. The only problem is I don't know when/where and I can't find the watch anywhere. So my advice would be to inspect your strap about once a month or so to look for cracking, etc. The strap should last a good 2-5 years depending on how often you wear the watch. A new strap will run you in the neighborhood of $100, but as another commenter wrote there are no options for a full titanium or even stainless steel strap.",3.0
"I bought this in the Fall of 2003 to be able to have a quick compass/elevation check on unfamiliar trails.  It handles those tasks well.

However, the strap breaks too soon compared to other watches.  And band replacement is far too difficult compared to other watches.  A slightly shorter replacement pin (or slightly bending a replacement pin to make it shorter) may be the only practical solution to a replacement problem if you're trying to do this in the field.  Also, the back is difficult to remove (over the years) compared to other watches (a 1 Yuan coin seems to be the best fit for the slot on the back).

The alarm is useless as it simply cannot be heard. The product manual is poorly written, which is odd because the Finns have great language skills.

So, although I like the watch, the on-going maintenance issues make it less than highly recommended.",3.0
"Cool features. Hard to see in sunlight, band is not as comfortable as I had hoped. Compass is hard to set.",3.0
"I've used this watch for 5 years now and I like it very much.  But the band, either Titanium or SS ( practically the same ) is definitely unacceptable.  I've changed it 3 times and lost a watch to it.  There are no full metal alternatives in the market.
Other annoyances :
 + Watch is not full SS or Titanium.
 + Alarm is inaudible",3.0
"Bought this watch after my beloved (plastic case) highgear axis finally bit the dust.  I've only played with it for a couple of days, but here's my take:

Pros:

1. Really great looking.

The metal case is the perfect size (the other suunto watch-- the vector-- is way too big for me and looks ridiculous)  This one looked ""right"" ad soon as I put it on.

2. Some nice features.

I especially like the compass bearing tracking (keeps you on your bearing by showing the differential).  Sweet!  it will probably take some time to just learn everything.

3. The band is easily adjusted to fit

No jeweler necessary.  It also looks very nice.  However, see the caveats below regarding the band...

Cons:

1. No altimter/ barometric graph.

My highgear had a nifty graph which showed the trend over the past couple of hours.  No such luck here, only a  3 position arrow sign.  It's possible to see the historical barometric pressure, but not graphically.

2. Weather station is crude compared to highgear.

Again, my highgear has neat weather forecasting icons (which were amazingly accurate!).  No such luck with the suunto.

3. Don't make a mistake when trimming the band!

Adjusting to fit is quick and easy, but keep in mind you do it by CUTTING segments of the elastomer strap... don't cut too much because there is NO going back!  Also, leave some space if you plan to gain weight...

4. Stainless???? Not really.

As mentioned, the band is elastomer with a couple of metal plates on the top.  The back of the case is all plastic.  Also disturbing is the advice in the manual ""the buttons shall not be pressed if exposed to water in any circumstances""  Geez!

5. White on black display

Neat looking, but I have to admit, much harder to read than the standard black on white.

With all my whining, you'd think I'd return it... but believe it or not, the looks outweigh the drawbacks (I know, I'm shallow.)  Plus I do like the compass features.  So overall, I'm sticking with it!",3.0
"Having had my Suunto Observer for over a month now, I like the features this wrist computer offers. However they are the same functions the Vector offers with a few differences. I dislike the dark background with lighter characters/digits in an LCD display; it is harder to read compared to the Suunto Vector that has the light background and dark characters. The alarm is quieter than the Vector, but the Observer does have the lower profile. The Observer has a double clip closed loop wristband while the Vector has a standard buckle wrist strap closure.

Unless you want to be observed as fashionable while having a neat gadget, I would go with the less expensive Vector.",3.0
"This adaptor fits my handlebars fine but is not the best fit for the Suunto Ambit, the Ambit is bigger and so does not sit all the way down on it. So it works but is not a perfect fit. I imagine that it fit the other Suunto models better.",3.0

"I was very exicited to get this to my daughter before she gets too old for it(she is 22 months), I also thought of this one because I have a baby who is 5 months now and soon (4 more months) will be able to ride it.

My daughter liked it, I thought she would ride it a bit more, but was on it no more than 10 mins and it is the first time for her.  Usually a brand new toy gets a lots of use at least the first time if they like it.

She learned very quikly how to turn it on and off, the motor is a bit loud, the traks are quite loose, and the wheels don't turn all at the same time.

A good thing I guess, is that even though, it only goes in circles because the tires are fix that way, you can just use the car with out the tracks and it will ride the same, unless you have heavy carpet.

"I would say this toy is NOT worth the money! My 17 Month old son is a VERY active baby so I thought this toy would entertain him for a while well I was wrong. He went crazy over it for the  first 5 days. Now a month later he barely rides it I have to say I am very disapointed! The good thing about this toy is I do not have to have the tracks down so he could ride it, it will go in circles by it self. The battery compartment is unsafe he always opens it there are to many wires where he can hurt him self. There is a seatbelt but he will not let me put it on. There is a button for the music which is easy for olders infants/toddlers to press. My son gets board easy and you can only go in co many circles before it gets boring. I would NOT recommend buying this toy.",3.0

"The Good: The pedometer has a clock so there's no need to wear a watch, it shows distance walked in miles and steps taken in addition to calories burned.  It has a back light, should you be in the dark.

The Bad: It's not the most accurate pedometer ever.  You set your stride length in inches and you can slide a sensitivity bar to suit your needs, but it still tells me I'm walking 12 or 14 steps when I'm walking ten.  I went on a walk today and it told me that I had taken 3657 steps in thirty minutes.  I find that hard to believe, so I either need to change my stride length or this thing is defective/of poor quality.

I guess you shouldn't expect much for the low price!",3.0

Well now after 3 weeks of use it has stopped functioning right. It now overestimates my steps by around 30 to 40 percent. I am going to give it back.",3.0
I found the measurements to be pretty accurate but I have a lot of trouble opening and closing it.  I end up adding 10 steps just trying to get it open.  This is probably because the clasp is all plastic and there are some variaions in the plastic.  I hope that after using it a bit the clasp will loosen.,3.0
"This inexpensive pedometer does its job as long as you handle it correctly. It measure the steps very accurate after a very easy adjustment. The heartbeat rate works ok. At first, I press my finger to the two spots at the back, and the reading is not stable. But when I just put my finger in the loop and use this single finger hold it, the heartbeat reading is very accurate. I guess this is the right way to use it.",3.0
"Most pedometers I've tried haven't worked at all.  At least this one comes close.  I walked a couple of measured paths and this one came close some of the time to the measured distance on its most sensitive setting.  Like most pedometers I've tried, placement of the pedometer is critical.  Sometimes, it's around 95% right and sometimes it's around 75% right.  It seems as if companies could do better than this, but this is the best one of the four I've tried.",3.0

"This really is a very nice seat cover, only it is made for thin seats and did not fit the exercise bicycle seat that it was advertised with. I was a little shocked that it was so obviously too small for the wide exercise bicycle seat. No one could have even tried to fit this seat cover. I would suggest that Amazon have a real human try to fit these things before pairing a seat cover up with an advertised exercise bicyle.

Again, the exercise bicycle and the seat cover are really nice. The seat cover just does not fit over the seat that comes with the exercise bicycle.",3.0
"really helps cushion during spin class, but totally ripped apart at the seems on me.",3.0
"Bike seats that come with the bike just aren't made for comfort. This fits nicely on the seat and stays in place. It really is thinner than I hoped and only helped a little. But, it is worth what it costs or if you only need a little bit of added gel padding.",3.0
"I really do like this seat cover.  That is, I like sitting on it.  Everything else about it is kind of a hassle.

PROS (Or ""the pro,"" really, because there's only one): It's comfortable.  I wouldn't say it's like riding on air, but it does make my bike saddle about 50% more comfortable and my sit bones about 50% happier.

CONS:

1.  As other reviewers have noted, it tends to slip to the side, no matter how tight you pull the drawstring.  I eventually solved the problem by attaching it to my saddle with double-sided duct tape, but that solution only works if you want to leave your seat cover on all the time.

2.  The seam frays and the fabric runs easily.  Mine started to pull apart along the seam after only a couple of uses.  I held it together for a while by painting the seam and the runs with clear fingernail polish, but after a few months the seam gave way anyway and I had to resort to duct tape.

3.  When it gets wet, it takes hours to dry, and in the meantime, riding around on a wet seat is distinctly unpleasant.  Since my bike stays outside nearly all the time, I've started carrying a plastic grocery bag in my backpack and tying it over the seat whenever it looks the slightest bit like rain, but I've had a few wet rides all the same.

So, bottom line (no pun intended): if you're looking for an easy, relatively cheap way to make your bike more comfortable, this seat pad will work, but you have to be prepared to put up with its flaws.  If you don't want the extra hassle, you'll probably be happier if you spend a little more and get a whole new bike saddle.",3.0
"This is a seat pad meant to cover your existing bike seat to provide more comfort. I mistakenly ordered this thinking it was the Bell Gel Base Bicycle Relief Seat Cover which has an indenture in the center and the edges are raised. Doesn't matter as this one was half the price of the one I intended to buy and probably more comfortable after reading the reviews about the Relief seat cover. Both look the same on a computer screen so be careful and make sure you're buying the right seat cushion. Anyway, this adds a slight cushion if you already have a semi cushion in your standard bike seat, but could probably work wonders on a typical hard standard bike seat . The seat that originally came on my road bike is pretty big and this cover fits on tight (almost too small but it fits). This cover would probably work best on a narrow seat. And yes, like the other reviews have mentioned it does tend to slid a little and get off center. This could probably be fixed with a good sticky double sided tape. It doesn't bother me much and though it doesn't feel like sitting on a cloud, it adds a little bit of extra comfort.",3.0

"I would say this product is good for beginner or someone who cycles infrequently. It will help alleviate some bum discomfort, but it won't 100% reduce it. There is nothing that will do this.

Please note that bum issues are a common complaint of most biking newbies and it generally takes a bit of time to ""toughen up""  your bum - it just takes time as you get used to riding.  Ensure your bike is properly set up for you (e.g. right saddle size and type and right seat height) if you are experiencing prolonged issues.",3.0
"I was unaware how wide this seat was going to be. It's more for a fat cruiser seat. If you have a tiny bike seat this won't fit. It is very cushiony and comfortable, though.",3.0
"Item does what it advertises - cushions your rear from hard seats.  However, I've had mines about a month now, and it's already beginning to get ""compacted"" or flat.  It's no longer as soft as it originally was, and it now starts to get uncomfortable after about an hour or so.  But it's still not as bad as the seat without it.
I use it on average twice a week for about 1.5 hours at a time.
Also, unlike some of the other reviews here, thankfully it has not (as yet??) split and the gel start to leak out.  It also is a bit wider at the back than most bike seats, so it sometimes slides about and goes off center slightly, even if you tighten the drawstrings as much as you could.
Bottom line - it'll give your rear end some comfort, but if I could do it again I'll probably try for a comfy seat instead first.",3.0
"I bought one of these at Wal-Mart, worked great for a year, comfortable, easy to install, etc., but then it was simply removed & stolen by a passerby. I can't think of a good way to 'lock' it on so I'm just going with a comfortable seat that can't be taken off so easily. Be warned.",3.0

So far, after a few rides, it works great, very little vibration, etc. The only drawback: the convex mirror does distort distances quite a bit, but it does provide a very WIDE view of the road. Certainly worth the $4.39.",3.0

Third,  now it's all together, less a working computer, I'm using it and it's ok but... the foot platforms are made of plastic and the heels of my feet keep sliding inward going  off the step and I would have to stop to place them right so they wouldn't slide off.  The platforms should have been made of rubber so your sneakers or shoes wouldn't slide, now I have to go out and by some slip resistant sneakers to wear on this thing.

This is the third Gazell freesyle I have brought.  This gazelle gizes me a good arobic work out as I listen to my own music. I love the machine for my simple airobic workout.

"I love the no/low impact of the gazelle.  Had some problems with the grip for the foot pedals.

"About 8 years ago I bought a Tony Little Gazelle Freestyle after seeing an infomercial. I figured I would use it for one month for $14.95 and then return it for my money. Well, it weighed about 75 pounds and would have cost a fortune to return it. But, as it turned out, I loved it. It was effortless and the inches and pounds came off in a hurry. When one of the cables broke recently, I decided to buy a new one, so I ordered this Gazelle Freestyle off the internet. It is not a Tony Little, as I thought. It is smaller and less sturdy. One of the plastic pedals broke while I was putting the thing together. It still works, but the quality is not as good. Unfortunately it is still to heavy to mail back for a refund. I doubt it will last as long as the original Tony Little Gazelle did.",3.0
"Easy to put together but this is definitely not a movable item. The Gazelle folds up but is pretty heavy to move about. I work out about three times a week and it is difficult to get a real cardio workout with just the Gazelle so I mix it in with some regular cardio strides etc. The walker is realy easy on the knees which is an added benefit. Great for the price, so far no loose parts but NOT a serious cardio machine.",3.0
"After not much use the machine started squeaking. It has become a major anoyance. The ""pre-lubricated"" bar that the instructions said not to apply any additional lubrication to seemed a bit dry when I assembled it. However, what do I know? I will need to disassemble and regrease soon or it will drive everyone crazy. On the plus side, it does provide a good workout. Providing a small tube of grease to be applied during assembly will fix this problem.",3.0
"I can't say anything that hasn't already been covered. Assembly wasn't difficult, but is frustrating when the instructions throw your off. ""It's just putting a couple of pieces, how hard could it be? Oh wait, it goes the other way...not like the way it says on the instructions. Thank you, useless diagram, thank you!"" After a week, this bugger squeaks like crazy. Get some Vaseline and apply it before you put the whole thing together!

As far as performance, it isn't much. You get as much as you put into it. You're elevated off the ground, so your weight is the only resistance. Didn't think I had to say this, but this is an aerobic exercise (for those fitness buffs expecting something more, this ain't it). It's meant to get you moving about rather than sitting on the bloody couch all day.

The workout instructions are straightforward. Nothing complex - lean forward to work out arms more, lean back to work legs more. But to really get the most of this, you just need to sprint and flail about like a madman.

I did get some buyer's remorse - I bought a stationary bike and use that way more often.",3.0
I use it twice a day.  Its not designed as well as the original gazelle and makes funny sounds.,3.0
"The product was shipped in a timely fashion, and received in fine condition.  I was somewhat dissapointed with the lack of resistance and ability to adjust resistance in the pedals. The various exercises which can increase strenuousness aren't quite as challenging as I was looking for. However, for a light, fold-up, elliptical model it's very sturdy and economical.",3.0
"I purchased the Gazelle Freestyle about 3 weeks ago and I really enjoy it. It is a pretty fun exercise that one can do just watching tv. My mother has really bad joints and she enjoyed the Gazelle and said that it actually makes her joints feel better.

However, after using the machine for about 4-5 days, the squeak began (as many other reviewers have mentioned) and it can get very loud. Also, I noticed that the mechanism holding up the cord that sways the pedals back in forth was not moving like it should be and was very tight. Then my mother got on and it suddenly snapped and she nearly fell! It often gets very loose, and if I don't keep tightening it, it will pop again! So just beware of that happening!

Other than that, its a fun machine and does give cardio and leg workouts.",3.0
"I just bought the gazelle a month ago. Overall I like the product.  I haven't had it long enough to see big results, but I feel a little more fit.  I must admit I knew it was a low impact work out, but I thought I would sweat a little more.  You really have to get a fast pace going to feel like you are really doing something.  My only complaints are that it's not as compact and easy to fold-up as I thought and the product came with an instructional vcr tape instead of a dvd.  Who has a vcr anymore?!",3.0
"I bought a refurbished Total Gym 2000 from a company called Fitness Quest (which appeared to be the outlet for Total Gyms at the time), through an online auction site.  That was 7 or 8 years ago.  The seat only said ""Total Gym"", not ""Total Gym 2000"", but it looked like the same product.  It has served me well over the years.  Now it makes a lot of noise when I use it, which is only a problem during the summer when I have the windows open and I don't want to give the neighbors any weird ideas.  (It sounds almost like a bed squeaking.)  I have also progressed to the point where I have my Total Gym at it's highest setting, and I would like to purchase the optional weight bar attachment to add more weight.

I was unable to find the weight bar attachment for this model on the manufacturer's web site, so I clicked on their ""contact us"" link to inquire about the weight bar attachment, how much weight the Total Gym would support, and how I can lubricate the joints to reduce the noise.  After a week, the company did not reply.  I emailed them again, explaining that I had been recommending this product to all my friends and would start recommending people to *not* buy this product if they didn't have the decency to reply, even if it was only to say ""I don't know"".  It's been more than two months, and the company still hasn't replied.

At this point, my impression is that it's a good product while it works.  If it gets noisy over time, I guess you will have to live with it.  If you don't order the optional attachments at time of purchase, good luck finding them later.  If you need support from the company, forget it.  I read that some people have problems with the wheels under the seat wearing out.  I hope it doesn't happen to me, because I won't know where to get replacements.  As for the weight bar attachment, I guess I will have to make my own using tubular steel or aluminum and getting some barbell weights to attach to it.  As for the weight limit, I will have to search the house for the manual, which I didn't think I would need after all these years.

When my Total Gym finally breaks, I will not buy another one.  Some companies just don't understand that service after the sale is just as important as selling the product in the first place.  The commercials were impressive and the results of using the product were impressive, too.  I really loved it.  If you don't mind paying money for something you might need to replace later, go for it.  Until the company wakes up, I will rank them along the lines of the company that made the $50 plastic (Suncast) water hose reel that broke.  (To add insult to injury, it was relabeled as a ""trusty"" Sears Craftsman!)  I refuse to pay $50 every few years for a plastic hose reel or any kind of product that isn't going to last.

"It lights super quick and easy, but the range to control the size of the flame is tiny. The knob rotates nearly all the way around, however only the first 10 degrees (if that) actually make a difference in flame size. Beyond the first 10 degrees of rotation you're on full blast.",3.0
"For some reason this thing only had one setting, HIGH! We tried everything to try and turn it down but it would not, luckily we only needed it to boil water, did the trick for that.",3.0
"So I finally got to use my stove this weekend when I went camping.  What i discovered on first use is that the Med and High setting worked just fine, however the Low setting won't stay and goes right back to medium unless you hold it.  That of course lead to burnt food that wasn't completely warm because no body has time to hold a knob while cooking.  My hope is that over time the knob will loosen enough that the low will be easier to achieve, if not i will have to reconsider my camping meals so that they can handle that kind of heat.",3.0
"Gas valve cheap, kind of chincy.",3.0
"Lock isn't working well, came a bit damaged. Other than that, good size and easy to use.",3.0
"Bought this to use for times the power was out. Worked good but the temperature knobs are EXTREMELY touchy. Dangerously so. It's impossible to adjust the flame height/amount of gas coming through. That being said, when I finally got it adjusted it worked great. Heated quickly and was easy to assemble.",3.0
Purchased it right after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and power outages made my electric stove useless.  Very convenient size and weight; can easily transport it to any location.  Inexpensive 2 burner stove and propane tanks easily accessible; in addition purchased adapter in order to use bigger propane tanks as needed.  Dislikes:  1.  Temperature knobs are sensitive and sometimes difficult to select low flame / temperature.  2.  The space between the aluminium grill is two wide some small pots and specially for small stove top coffee makers / percolators.  Overall recommend to purchase at least one for emergency purposes if you normally use an electric stove; and very convenient to transport it to any site.,3.0
It's nice there are only two true settings: high and *very* high. We thought there was something wrong with ours because lack of low setting but it turns out that's just how they are. It does the job well though as long as you keep whatever it is you're cooking moving,3.0
"I wanted to like this but there are some things that made me give it a low score.  I took it out for the first time this weekend and after opening and closing about 2 times, the left corner of the grill came detached from the frame.  Now when I open the top it rubs against the the detached piece.  Also the I'm not sure if it was the wind or not but the burner on the right kept going out while I had no problems with the left.",3.0
works fine. the latch to close it doesn't always stay. the construction seems kind of cheap,3.0
"I used this for the first time on a canoe trip a couple weeks ago.

Setup is easy although the propone tank sits really odd next to stove. Wish it had a flexible hose instead of the ridgid pipe.

  It is impossible to adjust the flame with any accuracy. I read reviews about cleaning o-rings and adjusting screws and I have to admit I did not try. I would expect Coleman to do that at the factory!

  Overall the stove works fine, just don't expect to do a lot of simmering with it.",3.0
"This works as expected. I don't like where the propane hooks up because it is in my way of cooking. But it's Coleman, and that being said it works as expected. Definitely a must have for family/leisurely camping.",3.0
"Haven't used propane stove yet because it feel out of my car (less than 4 feet up), hit the ground, and the hinges broke away from the base.",3.0
"I have a classic one that is probably 15-20 years old. Still works but needs a seriously good cleaning. My wife bought me a new one to replace the old one. The old one has a piano hinge between the lid and base. Closes nice and solid. The new one has two small hinges that are a little loose. Why is this a problem? Because the lid won't close properly. It closes offset and the front latch either won't latch or easily unlatches. If you're careful, you can get it to close properly and latch properly. But, any solid bump to the lid and boom, loose again.",3.0
"I wanted to love this, as I've owned one before, but I have one complaint, which is why I gave it three stars. If that issue was fixed, this would be a five star review. That problem is the control valves. There's very little room for fine adjustment of the flame...it's either off, or nearly on full blast, with very little space to fine-tune the flame. I've had other propane stoves that allowed a wide range of adjustment, but these controls feel cheap and sloppy, and give me very little ability to turn down the flame to a simmer. Not what I expected from Coleman, as I've owned one of these before, and it didn't have this problem. It's still useable, which is why I didn't send it back, but the quality seems to have slipped a bit since I last owned one.",3.0
I returned after a bit of disappointment. Does not simmer well and used a lot of propane. Dependable and robust otherwise.,3.0
"This is not a bad grill for the money, but for a $100 more you can get a really great grill from Coleman with far better control.  This one will boil water and allow you to heat basic food, but it's essentially either on or off.  Trying to adjust temperature is ineffective.  On the positive side, it has very basic and robust construction and is easy to start.  It's also quite light and small when folded up.",3.0
You get what you pay for.  I wish I had listened to other reviews about the knobs.  It was high or off. Worked fine for coffee but too hot for anything else.  Will try the fix that someone else posted. Hope it works.  Bacon half raw half burnt.,3.0
"Just finished a two week camping trip through southern Utah with this stove.  Works really well for heating water for stuff like coffee or oatmeal.  We pre-made a few dinners to heat up and this stove doesn't work well for this at all.  I basically has two settings high and really high. There's no way to just slowly heat something without burning it.

The wind block works well to keep the flame from going out even in strong winds we experienced throughout the Utah desert.",3.0
"Light and easy to transport. Very powerful
Cons: the valves are very touchy. Didn't crank it past 5degrees and it heated all our things very well. Almost too well. Tough to adjust because of it.",3.0
Sticky knobs make it so it will only operate on high. Does not turn down to a lower setting :-/,3.0
"I receved the stove in an orderly fashion, the shipping was perfect no dents or dings on the package. It was as described on amazon exactly, new coleman classic propane stove.
Pros.
-The stove came fully assembled.
-Includes directions in multiple languages.
-Burners are fully adjustable.
-Folds down into a slim space.
-Easy propane hook up.
-Great output.
Cons.
-The flow adjustment valves are a little difficult to get exactly what you want out of them.
-The lid, or cover is stamped with ""coleman"" so it has a small flex to it.
-The Tabs that insert into either side to hold the lid up and block the wind on sides are a bit difficult to insert, and seem cheaply made.

Overall the stove is actually a great value if you go car camping, and want to be able yo have breakfast lunch or dinner without firing up a charcoal grill, or starting a fire. No good for backpack camping being about 10 lbs.",3.0
"Maybe I didn't read the description well enough, but there is no igniter built in.  Kind of a PITA.",3.0
okay.,3.0
"I would give it a '5', except I had issues with the latch.. Could not open it after a few uses and almost seemed like it was going to break off...
I finally got it free, but a rivet looks damaged..",3.0
"It's not as well made as my 20yr old unit but it works.

Pros: light, simple, provides good heat/flow.  Very easy to clean compared to old models, just wipe it out.

Cons: adjustment valve doesn't provide enough low volume range, very hard to get a low/simmer flame.  My old unit has excellent range on the low end.",3.0
We have trouble with controlling the flames.,3.0
"Preface: I am in the Army and work at Ft Polk and spend 1-3 weeks a month living out of the back of a humvee.  I cook mostly pork chops and eggs on this stove though occasionally other items.

My only complaints about this product is that the fuel control knob is WAY too touchy.  Full blast is 1/4 turn.  I end up doing 90% of my cooking on the absolute lowest setting possible and even sometimes that is too high.  If the knob had more control I would rate it a 4.5.

Also there is a not shown attachment valve that goes on and off easy enough but there isn't anywhere to store it.  You end up putting it between the burners and it sort of slides around.  Just a few clips would make storing it way easier.

This stove is amazing for boiling water as it gets really high super fast but for any type of heat controlled cooking it's challenging.",3.0
"The dials on this stove aren't as hardy as we'd like them to be. They ""over turned"" somehow (it must have somehow gotten jostled, we weren't yanking on them hard, so we don't know how they got this way) and now turning on and off the stove, one must turn the dials past their ""rest"" point, if that makes sense. It isn't a huge deal but it does affect the performance of the stove, thought it is still usable.",3.0
"I would have bought a better stove if I had known how temperamental the knob controls are.  Very uneven flow of gas when adjusting.  probably should have spent more money.  Also,  an ignitor would have been nice.",3.0
"As mentioned elsewhere, the knobs to control the flames are super sensitive.  Like super super super sensitive.  I might have to disassemble it and try the fix posted in another review.  Beyond that, the stove works pretty well.  Nothing fancy, but it cooks, so that's fine for me.  Make sure you have a grill lighter.",3.0
Great stove but mine came dented and have issues closing it now.,3.0
"I had high hopes for this grill but it was not to be.  When I hooked it up and tried to start it, it was almost impossible to regulate the flame.  It came on full blast and didn't want to turn down. Ruined my brand new skillet and breakfast didn't come out good either. I think the regulator is defective.  Now I have to try to get it replaced.  Big hassle.",3.0
"A little touchy, hard to adjust to a low flame",3.0
"I had an old one of these and feel that the new one is sleeker and built better!  The unfortunate part is that ""low"" heat is not very low.  you are not able to simmer or just keep something warm on it, it is always cooking or the gas shuts off if you move the dial to low.",3.0
Not much regulation in regards to temperature --- hot or hotter. There are better stoves available.,3.0
"Surely Coleman can come up with an igniter in this price point. Valves are cheesy plastic with little fine control. Make lighting difficult.
Works well when lit.",3.0
Just like what I remember from my childhood! Quality is the same.,3.0
"I had received a broken one which was quickly and efficiently replaced by Amazon. I quickly set up the new one to see if it was functioning properly and it seems to be. However, there is a lot of play in the regulators. You have to turn them nearly off to set the burners to low, and the burners are at full blast with just half a turn. Interestingly, you can continue to turn the regulator knobs almost two complete turns with no difference in flame after the initial half turn. Not an insurmountable issue, merely an annoying one.",3.0
"great except it doesn't have a self-starter. Those self-starters are dirt cheap to manufacture, there's no good reason to not make them standard... 3 stars due to the lack of the start button but otherwise a great product",3.0
"excellent stove, however, the gas control comes in high or turbo! no low medium or anything else, the knob deals rotate a long way, but the amount of gas it comes out is huge! if you want to cook on low, you almost have to keep the gas closed and if you go over it'll go out, so if you need to boil water on the quick this is your product, but if you want to cook an omelette you'll end up with a runny in the middle and black on the outside omelette.",3.0
"Sturdy product, but very difficult to control the heat. The controllable portion of the dial is about 10 degrees. The remaining portion of the dial is full heat.",3.0
"no igniter (probably safety issue).  The knobs don't have a gauge of high/low/off, so when adjusting the heat you have to be extremely careful not to turn off the stove. If you turn the gas too low obviously the fire goes out.. which makes having no igniter so much more painful, because you have to take off your food and reignite with a lighter.

Other than that.. great stove and well built.  I'm slowly adjusting to the knobs and lighting it isn't difficult for me.  Slowly turning down the gas while monitoring the flame level works fine for me",3.0
"Good stove in all respects except the grill has too much space between the bars. I have to be careful not to tip the pans or pots. Would be 5 star except for this.  Much better stove than the liquid fuel ones. I use regular size pans and coffee pot so nothing unique. Overall, I like the stove and it is a quality product. I have kept it and will use it.",3.0
hard to control the strength of the flame especiall when taming it down.,3.0
It's either full on or off there is no in between when cooking.,3.0
Works well. The burners are difficult to make operate on a very low heat setting.,3.0
"The burners on this stove are not tuned correctly.  They have no low setting.. its all high from the moment you light it.  Your food cooks really fast though but you sure do go through the cans of propane.  I didn't test the stove before my camping trip, and was forced to use it because this was all we had to cook on.  We've used it for the past 3 camping trips and we're making it work, but it's not like the other stoves in our group.",3.0
"Works great while camping. These stoves have been made for so long now, I think they should be able to figure out how to give me a good range of flame. It is very difficult to dial in anything between off and inferno.",3.0
"very good and must have item. The only thing is if this one exposed to hot sunlight, somehow the bottom warps and it is not stable.",3.0
Stove was packed correctly and there was no damage on the shipping package.  The stove itself iis not level.  The 4 legs are not equal.  A 1/4 inch shim is required on one corner to level the stove.  Very poor quality control.,3.0
"Its a Coleman so it should be awesome, but its not like the old Coleman days.  Works good, but the burner valves tend to slowly turn themselves off if you try to simmer.  Works perfect on higher levels.  Only use it twice so far.",3.0
It works. Mine came dented even tho it was in 3 boxes. The flames control tricky. 90% of the dial is full blast and the remaining 10% either jump to full blast or off. I eventually learned to work with it. Overall this is OK.,3.0
My brother bought a similar Coleman that came with extra stuff like a soft case for the same price I bought this Coleman I got for but with no extra stuff.. However it did get the job done.,3.0
"Eh, the stove works as advertised.  The quality is a little rough.  The metal is a bit weak and I had to use pliers to reattach the wind guards.  The burner knobs are very sensitive in that you have about a quarter turn between full blast and off.  The burners themselves work very well though, nice even heat distribution.  For the price I think it's decent.  I wouldn't do anything more rugged with it then car camping with it setup on a picnic table though",3.0
"Needs better adjusting  nozzles, better quality would feel safer with propane involved.",3.0
"Functional stove, made in China and it feels like it.  Cheap price, so that is what you get.",3.0
"Was a bit turned off. Years ago I bought a Walmart brand stove that had fold down legs, they weren't the best but they kept the stove off the surface it was sitting on. This sits directly on whatever you set it on.",3.0
"I have used this stove numerous times on camping trips....One burner, while both are on high burns hotter than the other....the burner the furthest away from the propane can. The perfect flows do not get heat up like the older propane stoves did...Takes a long time to make a pot of coffee while using the Coleman ( auto drip ) coffee pot....due to the lower heat from the perfect flow technology....",3.0
It works well but I find it difficult to assemble the tank and regulator and to adjust the flame.  I much prefer the single burner stove that attaches to the top of a propane tank.,3.0
flame adjustment is very sensitive,3.0
"Works just fine for the price, however one knob will not stay at a very low simmer setting. For $20 I can't really complain to much.",3.0
The fire power is good when use only one stove. But it goes weak when use both together....,3.0
"Like the stove but it would be nice to have automatic light on it.  Plus its really hard to control temp, its either way high or so low it turns off.",3.0
"So...bought this for our annual Cub Scouts camping trip. First off, I am glad I did because it was in the 20s the weekend we went and I needed all of the hot coffee and the scouts needed a lot of hot chocolate!

My biggest issue is with the burners (kind of important here). They work just fine but they only have two settings (ignore the dials - they do nothing). You can either have it off or on afterburners. It even sounds like you've turned on the afterburners.

Several of us brought stoves and because mine was either in jet engine mode or off we made all of the coffee and hot water on mine (worked fast) and actually cooked food on the other, more manageable stoves.",3.0
Not the best Coleman product I've ever owned.  It's hard to control the flame height.  It's usually too high a flame or too low,3.0
have not taken out of the box yet,3.0
"The burners may have to be burned in or maybe it was user error, but we kept turning it down and they kept going out.  Regulating the temp seemed difficult.  No low it seemed, just very hot-used it to cook breakfast and it did ok cause we like crispy bacon.",3.0
not bad for the price.,3.0
Coleman used to make better stuff. Tinny poor control with valves no where near is good as the one I bought 30 plus years ago. They must make this to sell at Walmart.,3.0
"I""m sure hundreds, perhaps thousands of reviews have been written about this fine classic.  But I have one complaint:  The rigid tube connecting the propane tank to the stock places a lot of stress on the brass fitting at the stove.  I have looked but can not find a flexible hose which has the correct fittings for these small tanks.",3.0
"Bought this for a recent camping trip and it worked like it should, but the quality is pretty much on par with most things that are made in China: mediocre. The burners work ok and are easy to light, but once they're lit the adjustments are not the most precise. One of the fold out flaps fell off and won't stay on. Came out of the box like that, but it's not worth sending back for a new stove so I'll just fix it myself. There is nowhere to store the propane pipe fitting when you're not using the stove other than just sticking it under the grill where it will rattle around while traveling. Overall I don't really think this stove is worth the price, but unfortunately this is the kind of cheaply made junk you get nowadays. If you can get it cheaper it might be worth it. It's definitely not the same Coleman quality camping stuff that my parents had when I was a kid!",3.0
"It is convenient and packs up well for car camping.  The stove gets very hot, and is great for boiling water.

The stove does not do 'simmer' particularly well.  Be careful with anything that needs lower heat settings.  Using a cast iron pan or high quality aluminum or copper clad pan helps.  Attempting pancakes, eggs or a side dish requires very close attention.

I would say that overall this is a good value, but there are better units available.

It does have good wind resistance to it, which is a definite plus outside.",3.0
I am happy enough with it but the burner controls could be better.........it is hard to regulate the flame and gets too hot for frying but boils water very quickly!,3.0
Would not recommend it because like other previous comments from other buyers it has poor adjustment on the flames. I will probably purchased a better one.,3.0
"This stove cannot be adjusted to a low flame setting. The adjustment knob lacks fine tactile feedback and springs back to ""high"". Good for certain uses, but not very practical for cooking. I sent it back, and the search is back on for a good camping stove.",3.0
"We purchased this to replace a similar stove that we had borrowed, and got the best price for it here.  It works precisely the way it says it does.  It's easy on fuel (one bottle for 4 meals and coffee over two and a half days) and it lights easily.  There is a difference in build quality and materials between the domestically produced one we had borrowed and this one and that's all I'm going to say about that.  If you're on a budget or just want something value-priced to stick in the camper this will do just fine and the price is hard to beat.",3.0
"I probably didn't read the description carefully enough, but I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't control the propane level, and therefore the flame. Stove is either on high or off. Also, it gets VERY hot (especially the grill).
Otherwise, it boiled water pretty darn quickly in my opinion.",3.0
Not all that wild about this stove.  Absolutely impossible to regulate flame to a low level.  I finally stuck a toothpick between adjustment knob and body of stove to get some degree of adjustment.  Ya gets whats ya pays for folk.,3.0
"I had bought this stove to replace my old one that finally failed big time (after many years of use, the last time I tried to use it there was a mini explosion - so MAKE SURE TO USE THIS ITEM OUTSIDE!!! Luckily no one was hurt).

Anyway, regarding the new stove, I am having the darnedest time trying to get a low simmer-able flame from it, each time I try to turn the heat down it either goes completely out, or the flame pops back up the high again as soon as I take my hand off the controller knob.  This is very annoying when you are trying to not burn your food.

I might take mine back and try the perfect flow one. I just want the ability to control my cooking temperatures as cooking everything on high isn't exactly what I thought I was buying.",3.0
The price is just about right for this stove.  It works but seems a bit flimsy in its construction.  The flame doesn't have as much range of control as I was hoping for.  You start turning it down and the flame just extinguishes.  The side wings are part of what feels flimsy.  So call it three stars.  It works but nothing to get excited about.,3.0
"The stove is a bit flimsy and the gas regulators are not very precise. The other reviews mentioning that the flame is hard to adjust precisely and that the adjustment easily changes is very true. However, that part was not a problem at all. Overall, it is a good buy for the money. Can you buy a better stove? Of course, but how much money do you want to spend? This one will satisfy the basic needs just fine.",3.0
I'm quite disappointed in my purchase. My father has an old old old Coleman stove that has worked extremely well over the years and I know these days everything is made cheaper and stuff doesn't last. But when I pulled this stove out I had high hopes and could tell it was made cheaply and won't last very long. I took it out on my last camping trip and it worked. Knobs are sloppy and hard to get set to a decent setting. Cooked a few dinners and breakfasts. I expect it to work for a while but overall this stove is garbage. Spend the extra money and find a better stove!!,3.0
"thought this would be a nice addition to my gear. until now did all of my cooking over a fire. good product for the money. I wish i would have gotten a 3 burner but for what i do, this works pretty well. controls were easy to use, heat settings were adjustable. I am happy with it.",3.0
"Other reviewers had the same problem with the control knobs (I thuoght it must have been just a fluke). It's a basic function- turn it on, light the burner and adjust the flame. Sounds simple, but it can't be done. Try to turn it down and the flame pops back up. Try to turn it up a little and it pops back down. Kept trying. Aha! I got it! Oops! It turned off.",3.0
"I've used this stove for one season now - so about 20 times.  It's OK.  It certainly functions well and seems well built.  I do not like the tray of this stove - it does not clean up easily.  The first time I used the stove, the tray became stained.  This is a big deal to me because I also have a Shepherd two-burner stove, purchased for significantly less than the Coleman, which has been used for 3 seasons and still looks new.  The tray on the Shepherd cleans up so much more easily than the Coleman.",3.0
"Not as good I was thinking it would be, very hard to get a steady low flame, needed to put a toothpick between the control knob and the stove base to get a low flame.

Even as I gave this only three stars, I hope this stove will last as long as the one it replaced.",3.0
"I bought this stove because it came highly recommended. When the stove arrived, I tested it out prior to going camping. It is very easy to set up. Good quality material. The biggest disappointment was the valve that controls the heat. It functions more like an On/Off switch. I exchanged the original one thinking I received a defect. The second one acted the same way. At that point, I didn't have time to get a new stove for my camping trip. I used the stove to cook just about every meal while camping. The problem with this stove is that the heat is always on high. When cooking I had to constantly stir the food to keep it from burning.

Overall, I think the stove is very easy to assemble and made of high quality material. It feels very solid. But the heat adjustment control is very disappointing.",3.0
"The stove is compact, light weight, easy to set up, and throws out a lot of heat. It's also a wonderful base for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coleman-5010D700T-Camp-Oven/dp/B0009PURJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coleman 5010D700T Camp Oven</a>. In our experience, the burner has basically two settings...high and higher...which is great if the main thing you want to do is boil water.  We like a little more sophistication in our camp cuisine, however, and it's almost impossible to get the flame low enough to simmer or simply keep things warm.  This is our second stove and we use it primarily to boil water for veggies, shrimp, etc. and heating the dishwater on one burner while the second burner runs the oven. So, it's great as a second stove but I'd be very frustrated if I had to rely on it for main cooking duties.",3.0
"This stove does a good job- as long as you want the flame on HIGH. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to turn down the flame to let food simmer. It is frustrating trying to lower the flame without turning the burner off. You can get it down pretty low, but as soon as you let go of the control knob, the flame jumps back up to a higher setting. Otherwise, the stove works fine.",3.0
"Just used it camping this last weekend.  Left burner worked.  Right burner did not.  Gas was flowing to it, but it would not light.  We are now in the process of returning it for replacement from Amazon.  They say it's currently out-of-stock, so we must wait for the new one to see if it works.
I'll update this review when we get the replacement.
Otherwise, we are usually happy with Coleman stoves.  Hopefully, the new one will work perfectly.
Happy camping!

9/23/2011 - The replacement process went well.  Amazon was great.  Even arranging for UPS to bring us the printed return label because our printer is broken.  Very helpful.  We received the new stove within 10 days of sending back the 1st one, even though they had said they were out-of-stock.  We set it up in the garage to see if it worked BEFORE we take it camping.  YES...both burners work!
Although, I can tell that subtle adjustments to the dial may not be possible.  To try to get a ""medium"" flame will take some luck and practice, I think.  The flame seems either ""high"" or near nothing/off.  But I've had that experience with most entry-level Coleman stoves.",3.0
"I always knew that Coleman was a good brand and ignored some of the reviews I read about the stove, but now I agree with one who wrote about the burner dials...he was right...there is no way to regulate the burners, they're either full blast or off.
Disappointed with that as it's tough if you only want to keep things warm.",3.0
"I've been through several types of these stoves / burners over the years. This one was a replacement for another that died. I'm not too hard on equipment but it is camping and things get used. Guess $$ doesn't buy too much any more.

Right out of the box it feels sturdy. The body of the stove itself isn't too bad and can handle typical abuse riding in the back of a truck, set up take down etc.

However....also right out of the box the two side wind block panels were just bouncing around disconnected. They are supposed to attach to a couple of poorly designed cheezy little metal clips. Good luck with these things. After a few minutes with a set of needle nose pliers I ""kinda"" got them to work. But they will not last long. Maybe a few set ups and take downs. A very poor design.

Also the knobs are made of the same cheap plastic that they have been for ever now. Though these do have a micro screw to keep them attached I still don't have much faith in them lasting too long.

It does cook OK. Heat is pretty adjustable. But I'd gladly pay a few bucks more for better quality parts and design.",3.0
"I could not open the stove when i received it.  I had to virtually pry it open and when i did i found the inside aluminum base where the burners were was badly warped thus interfering with the stove opening.  several other people had the same issue so buyer beware.  the instructions for using the stove were inside the stove.  I had to look up the instructions to be sure I wasn't doing something wrong.  Very poor place to put instructions when there clearly is a defect with this stove.

Update 8/11/11:  i returned the stove to amazon and found a store local to me that was selling the same exact model for a few more dollars. Opened the box and took the stove out.  It opened easily and with no issues.  If you buy one of these stoves from Amazon and it does not open easily (i.e. you need to pry it open) the stove is defective.  return it!  with the number of people saying they couldn't open theirs if you want this stove i would buy it locally.  I am using it to heat water for canning it the flame can be turned quite high and is very hot.  Heats up my water to a boil in probably 15 minutes or so.  I'm actually quite pleased with the stove now that i found one that opens easily.  You are better off buying it locally so you can be sure it opens easily.",3.0
Work OK but the burner control is some what touchy. Cant control the flame as good as my other Coleman stove.,3.0

I have used this a few times at the beach.  I love the size and how it folds up.  It's not the best build quality so don't expect it to hold up for years and years.  It's cheap.  Just buy a new one.,3.0
We used this once and as we were adjusting its position the outside seam ripped. We still use it but it's not the best quality.,3.0
It made it through our beach vacation but just.  At the end of the week we dropped it in the trash as we picked up.  It was falling apart. But as I said it was a week on the beach getting wet.  It was a great size and liked the way it folded for easy carrying till the handle broke. started falling apart day 3 or 4.,3.0
"A little disappointed. Its still usable but like many others said, the side came unraveled after the first use.  Not sure how long it will last as is. I suppose I can hand sew it but seems kinda dumb that I have to do that when I just got it.",3.0
"fell apart the first time a used it. doesn't clean off as easily as I hoped. still useful because it folds up so well and you can tuck small items in it, such as a book or napkins.",3.0
"The concept of this portable fold up mat is really great.  I thougth the material is good quality, but after one use on the beach laying coolers or just simply lying on it, the corners already ripped. I 'm giving it a three for the fact that it could have ripped due to the cooler, but it shouldn't have snagged so soon after one or two use. Perhaps an improvement on the material can help and i can probably change my mind to 4 stars.",3.0
"Its a great mat, I just love how it folds up with the carrying handle. The only negative I have is that its not waterproof. I use it a lot on grass and if its damp it comes through, so I have to layer on top with more blankets and that's a lot to carry to a park. I am going to have to look for a different ground mat that I can use on the grass.",3.0
"Nice product, gets the job done. Nothing fancy but the price was reasonable. Hope it'll last more than one season.",3.0
"The only reason that this is receiving a 3-star rating is because I did not receive the multi-color (blue, green, yellow & red) as was shown in the picture.  I received a Navy blue and while one.  This problem was brought up in other Amazon reviews that I read before I decided to purchase it, but thought ""maybe it was a fluke"".  No fluke!  If you have your heart set on a specific color, I don't know if you want to take the chance of ordering this mat.  The product, itself, seems ok, but ""darn it, people, can't you get the color correct?"".  Too much of a hassle to send it back, so I will be keeping it.  I guess that is the main problem with ordering on line...the bate and switch technique...which is illegal, by the way.",3.0
It's always disappointing when you buy something 5 years ago and buy it again in 2013 and find the product quality has gone down. I really liked these mats for camping when I purchased them 5 years ago and was happy when I found them again on Amazon in 2013. Figuring they would just keep making them the same way I bought another so I would have more coverage with my old mats and now my new one but the quality is bad comparatively. I would doubt that this new mat will outlast the old ones. I was actually afraid it would rip when I folded it.,3.0
"Came in black and white. I ordered two from Amazon. One on black and white. One in dark green and white from this place in Brooklyn, NY. I'll keep um . Gave one to one of my sons while in Arizona  visiting. Not worth the hassle of sending back.",3.0
The mat works great but it's not very wide.,3.0
"I ordered this from Walmart, great price, same mat in blue. It's firm and I needed that and not so thin. I've had it three days and the very noticeable odor has still not gone away!! I even put it outside for awhile. Not happy about that. Others have said no odor and one person said it took awhile to go away. I sure hope it does since I like the feel of the mat even if I haven't exercised on it yet much. Comments from others about this? Thank you.",3.0
what i expected,3.0
Thickness was not as expected.,3.0
"great product, however, I used it as a dog bed and they ate it.",3.0
"I almost gave this a 4 star... but I think I have a few too many complaints for that.  I wouldn't say don't get it, I'd just say consider it's uses more limited than you might expect.  I bought this for p90x.

Its convenient, it's great for any exercise where you'll be laying on your back if you, like me exercise at home and don't have a bench, but have learned how to do some weights (floor flys, a-frame, etc).

It's great for crunches and sit ups.

In my opinion, it's bad for push ups.  The mat is too soft for that much weight in such a small spot, causing the heel of my hand to sink deep, whereas the front of my hand, holding less body weight, pushes back because the mat isn't THAT soft.  This is a painful, carpel tunnel issues triggering position.  If part of you is on the mat, and not the rest of you, I've found it wants to slide, so it's no good for pushups, no good for downward dog, etc.  Keep a yoga mat handy for exercises needing a firmer surface- but that kind of ruins some of the convenience bonus.

Its also a lot narrower than I anticipated, so if you are a sizeable individual, you may find your movement feeling a little extra restricted.  Even as a fairly thin individual myself, there are some things in my routine (superman/banana anyone?) that make this mats width a bit of a nuisance.

The ""puzzle"" style exercise mats, in my opinion, for what I do is better all around- not too soft for pushups, not too hard for floor flys and sit ups.  Unfortunately, with those taking them apart and putting them back together is not only inconvenient, but damages them.  Unless you want to leave them out permanently, they aren't a good option.",3.0
"A little bulky, but good enough.  Too bad it's only offered in two colors",3.0
"Not bad, I don't feel the floor through it doing it while doing crunches but I wish it was a bit more dense like the ones at my gym",3.0
"Smaller than expected. Bought for my daughter to do gymnastics on, and it's way too small.",3.0
"I originally wanted Blue but, black was cheaper but, amazon didn't give me any choice but, to choose black.  I love the product hate the color. Amazon prime gets in the way of customers wanting to buy a product for a good price.",3.0
smaller than I thought,3.0
"It's a mat, thickness is OKAY for sit-ups and low intensity exercises.",3.0
"It is abit on the heavy side to carry; and you kind of stick to it when it is hot, but overall fine for the price.",3.0
Not nearly the quality I was hoping for.  But certainly as good as what could be expected in the price range.,3.0
"It's okay, smaller than thought but my girls seem to use what they can out of it...McNabb",3.0
"I got these to practice BJJ at home and friend's houses. I can't recommend them for that, at least if you are a heavy guy. I'm 150lbs and I find them just OK, however heavier friends find them way too soft. The material is also VERY loose, it is not firm at all. If you read the reviews, you will see people calling it very solid, then others years later mentioning the drop in quality. Good thing I got them on a special.",3.0
cheaper in walmart so can choose between,3.0
"First, I love these mats.  Better than a yoga mat for exercise, especially on hard floors.  However, the padding is very variable.  I just bought a second mat and it's much softer than my first.  Nearly too soft.  I don't like it as much as the first.  My first mat is 5 stars, this one maybe 4, but overall it gets a 3 star rating for being too variable.",3.0
"We use these in case the kids fall off the trampoline. The problem is whatever they are made of or chemicals or whatnot, my kids somehow got all these rashes and hives from being on it, rolling on it.  Maybe they are all allergic, but something sure seems wrong here. Not sure what chemicals they use in it, but whatever it is, we no longer roll on it.  I still keep it in case the kids fall off the trampoline, but it's only for emergency and for not a bad price.",3.0
okay mat,3.0
"Bought them to use for sleeping on for camping and my sons overnights with friends. A bit hard for my taste and a little bulky (as I knew) but still MUCH easier than blowing something up and having it leak. Cant complain for what I paid for them. As exercise mats, Im sure they're 4+ stars.",3.0
The mats are prone to punctures. Within a week of use they had several holes . The mat itself was of decent quality. The seller shipped quickly.,3.0
"Pad is ok and a good price, but did not work for hubby's back.  Too dense.  Good lenght for 6"" 2.",3.0
"wish it were wider that's all, otherwise it has a good cushion to keep you off the floor while you are exercising",3.0
"I like this mat - it is a perfect size for 1 person, good thickness, durable, easy to store.  I just hate that I can smell the PVC  when I use it.  I'm hoping that fades over time.",3.0
"For the price it's an okay mat. It's not as firm as other mats we have and it wrinkles easily. For yoga, children, pilates, it's fine, but I'd want a firmer mat for gymnastics or MMA, etc.",3.0
Not as big as I thought it would be....but a decent mat for our 4 year old.  We use it in our Karate Dojo for the kids as well.,3.0
"I bought one of these 6 or 7 years ago.  My then-new little puppy tore up one panel on it, but I've been using it ever since anyway, turning the torn up (and I mean torn up) panel down.

So I finally decided to get a new one.  It appears the quality has suffered.  Softer foam.  Somewhat ill-constructed cover, crooked seams, loose material.  Less mass.  Not the quality of the first one.  I'd have rather paid $20 more for high quality for a mat I hope to use for years.  Oh well.

Perhaps an Aeromat would have been a better choice.",3.0
CUTE BUT NOT 4 REAL CHILD SPARRING IN THE RING,3.0
"These are amazing quality and look awesome, but they are so small! My 7 year old couldn't get them on without us squishing his hands into them and he's a small boy. No chance for my 9 year old. These would be great for a kindergartener or 1st grader but not beyond that.",3.0
"Very hard to put all the way on, but makes my 3 year old somewhat happy.",3.0
These look awesome and was super excited to get these for my 8yr old son but they were way too small for him. More for younger kids or children with small hands... Will be returning and searching for larger size,3.0
"The quality is great, but so thick my 6 year old can't clasp his hand into a fist.",3.0
For cheap boxing gloves they do the job.  My 9 year old uses them in his boxing gloves but they can be hard to put on and I slipped part of my hand in and they definitely are not as comfortable as higher priced gloves (at least as comfortable as mine).  That being said they get the job done and kids grow quickly :),3.0
I thought when I purchased these it said Youth Large or XL... guess not... these won't even fit on my 2nd grad boys hands... they fit my 5 year old perfect though.,3.0
Ok gloves. Straps would have been better.,3.0
They have so much padding stuffed in there my kid can barely make a fist. Maybe that's more of your preference. I ended up having to buying a more muay thai based glove for kids that are better molded in the shape of a fist and she loves it.,3.0
To small for the kid,3.0
These were too small for my 8 year old,3.0
Flimsy design.  Kind of like a sweat pant for the hand without the belt.,3.0
used but not sized right for age group did not fit child size ordered for almost fit dad put away for older,3.0
"I also seem to have a problem with them being too small.  Using Everlast Evercool (a bit big but she will grow into them) instead.  Seem to be well made and inexpensive other than having a fit problem.  They should make them bigger with a lace up to make it easier to get them on/off and to avoid fit problems, in my opinion.",3.0
"My 10 year old likes it, seems very cheaply made for the price. I would not purchase it again, not worth it",3.0
"Ok I am on the hunt for a good pair of gloves for a young child.  These gloves are almost too big and bulky.  They are like having pillows on your hands.  Now the problem w these youth gloves is that if u have a young child the main thing that you can do with them to give them any kind of training is to have them hit pads or hit the bag. This glove is too big and bulky for them and it is hard for them to want to make a proper fist and deliver a good punch.  You need a glove that is lighter weight and hast good wrist support and probably velcro closure and good wrist support.  This glove is hard to get on, not good wrist support, is too bulky, like a big pillow.  It is not bad quality but just bad design for young athletes that you want to get into training.  You basically want a smaller bag glove that can provide wrist support.  young kids shouldnt really be competing in a boxing match or sparring  but they can hit the bag & hit pads.  I wouldnt even want to spar w these gloves.  The kid cant even get the idea in their head to make a good punch w these.  It is like if u were an adult and had 28oz gloves on it would look weird.  My advice would be to skip out on these and get something else.  At the moment I do not have an alternative but I am looking into Title youth training gloves with velcro strap that may be better.",3.0
I was suprised by how mis-shaped these were when we got them.  The stuffing was strange.  They're for my 6 year old and appear to fit him as expected (a little big).  They do what they're supposed to though.  Would only purchase these in person again.,3.0
"I purchased these gloves because they said ""Youth"".  There's no way my seven year old can wear these. I picked up a pair at a garage sale that were another brand but also said youth, and they are half the size of these.  I am a man and have large hands and I can get my hands in these gloves.",3.0
"There is a 60 pound weight limit on this pogo stick.  My son is almost 6 and he's tall so he's already at 60 pounds.  So far it works ok, but I don't know how long he'll be able to use it. Certainly not until he's 10, like the write up says.

The toy is also very noisy when used.  And after a few bounces my son gets tired of it.",3.0
"Just make sure your child is tall enough for their waist to be level with the handle otherwise they'll just keep falling backwards.
Very sturdy construction",3.0
"The quality of this item is great. The concept is great. The weight limit however is low (only 60lbs). My nephew is 5 and isn't heavy enough to make it go up and down, however my niece is 8 and is strong enough but is already over the weight limit already.  This toy will really only fit a small window of ages/weights as opposed to what the description says. The kid has to be heavy enough to compress the spring but not too heavy or it bottoms out when they land.",3.0
Grandchild loved it!,3.0
"I'm a little disappointed that I spent $30 each on these.  I bought two of them for my twin boys 5th birthday.  The round bottom is suppose to help stabilize the pogo until your child gets more skilled at using it, but instead I think it makes it more difficult to use.  The pogo is very stiff and hard to push down to get any springing action. I've tried several times to help my kids jump on these with that round support and they kept getting hurt and falling off.  I haven't tried it without round piece yet, that's why I'm giving this three stars instead of two because maybe, just maybe it will work better once I remove that stupid base from the bottom.",3.0
The kids are not too crazy about this because I can't remove the round disk on the bottom once they got the hang of the balancing.,3.0
Was difficult for my 5 year old grandson to balance on.,3.0
This was a gift for a 5 year old grandson. I have not heard anything that would suggest the item was not satisfactory.,3.0
got this pogo so that my 5 year old could jump along with older siblings. She is not thrilled with it. The jumparoo looks more exciting to her because it moves around.,3.0
I bought this for my 5 yr old son that wanted one for christmas. He will be 6 in February.  I read the description & it says for kids 5-8 & up to 100 lbs but when I got it it says max weight 60 lbs. My child is very tall & weighs 60lbs now.  I loved that it had a base so they can learn but I sent it back because he would not be able to play with it for very long & I paid $48 for it.  I am not sure if there is a 8 yr old out there that is under 60 lbs anyway.,3.0
"My daughter 'had' to have a pogo stick.  This was fun for about a day and then she was over it.  Maybe when she weighs more it will be more fun.  She is six and about forty pounds.
It seems to be just something kids 'want' at some point in their life.  Good price from amazon.",3.0
I purchased it for a 3 year old and she had a very hard time using it.  I think it will work better once she grows up and gets a little bit heavier.,3.0
"I purchased this for my 5 year old girl who weighs 44 Lbs. The Pogo stick was a little tough to use at first, I had to grease the springs and enclosure. It is a little smoother now. In my opinion, this pogo stick will be beneficial for kids over 50-60 lbs.",3.0
"The description states that this is for ages 5 and up and gives no weight limit.  The box, however, states that it is only for kids up to 60 lbs.  My daughter is 64 lbs. and she is too heavy for it.  She cannot bounce very well because the spring is not ""heavy duty"" enough to support her.  I will keep it only because my younger daughter can grow into it, but Amazon really needs to include this information in their product description.",3.0
"Bueno para mantener a los nios ocupados jugando en reas como parques o lugares adecuados para andar con seguridad, buena presentacin del embalaje",3.0
a bit high for the beginner to step up on.  age appropriate but child needs to have long legs. Good quality.,3.0
This was a present for my 4 year old. He was not able to bounce up and down on it at all. His older sisters age 7 and 8 were barely able to bounce on it and they are almost over the weight limit. The spring is just too stiff! It also made a terrible grinding noise when they tried to play with it. I would NOT recommend this product!,3.0
"My 3 1/2 yo wanted a pogo stick from Santa-that's all he wanted- A POGO STICK. I bought this one since I thought MAYBE he could do it since it had the wide base.  However, it's HUGE!  It's too tall for him to even get on, nevermind balance.  It's super durable, but I would recommend for not 5 and up like on the box, more like 8 and up!  Or your child might break their neck!",3.0
These tack balls are supposed to have better grid but this is slippery to the touch and doesn't give a good bounce unless over-pumped with air. It's a fraction larger than most other balls and you will notice it shooting and on the dribble. I would recommend the ZI/O as opposed to this one.,3.0
i should have bought a rubber ball for outdoor. Composite is not that good,3.0
Not good to play on the street it gets slippery,3.0
I would say this a OK outside ball but feels better inside. The main thing that I didn't like about it was the weird color it would change into when scuffed.,3.0
Good ball,3.0
Not sure what Tack Soft is supposed to mean but these balls were very slick and not easy to handle because of it.  Would not order again.,3.0
Pretty good ball but it seams a bit light and gets scratched up quickly. Good grip but gets slippery when you sweat.,3.0
"It's a decent ball for the price. The grip does wear over time, so you need to be cognizant of that. For a shootaround and casual game ball, I think it's good. Look elsewhere if you're wanting gripage.",3.0
"This is a decent ball.  The grip is good on it.  The only thing is that it is a bit small for a 29.5"" ball.  I compared it to a few other basketballs that have and this one isn't quite a big.  It is definitely not a ladies ball but is just shy of a man ball.",3.0
It had really good reviews so maybe I was expecting a lot out of a cheap basketball. The cushion and feel of the ball is great but the ball I received has a few issues. I have to pump the ball every few weeks (only casual play maybe twice a week) also the ball warped really fast. When I got the ball it seemed a little warped but after 2 days you could tell the ball wasn't round but it's not warped to the point where it's unplayable. instead of a circular it's slightly Elliptical,3.0
"Well, the first thing that turned me off was Amazon shipped this to me in a cardboard box without the original packaging. I'm assuming they did this to save money on a bigger box. The second issue is, in my opinion, his ball feels like a size 6 instead of the official size 7. It's slightly smaller than my old basketball, but my old ball is close to 10 years old. Maybe it expanded a little? I don't know. Other than that, the ball is great.

If the above issues were resolved I'd give this ball 5 stars. You can't find a better basketball for under $20. Good tacky feel, solid indoor basketball. Reminds me of Spaldings old Grip Control ball.

As soon as I make sure this ball is actually 29.5"" I will come back and give it 5 stars.",3.0
"The ball is decent, definitely better than a rubber street ball, but the tack soft actually feels kind of slick to me at times. Maybe it needs to be broken in a little, but for the money the Zi/0 Excel ball is much better. **The tack soft might work better outside, I'll admit I have only used it indoor.",3.0
"This ball seemed great when it was new, but the surface wears off pretty quickly if used outdoors.  Probably would hold up longer if only used on an indoor court, but not recommended for outside.",3.0
"Pretty, my daughter said when she first saw the ball and I thought the same thing as well, but event she realized the problem when she started to play with the ball.

The texture of the ball was great and durable for various surfaces, but the bounce rate felt heavy and it didn't feel ""rubbery"" enough.

In the description it said soft, but it was far from that. Lots of arm work is needed to keep the bounce momentum even average no matter how tall the person was.

Great gift for just signing, but not playing.",3.0
"I got this for my son who is still little.  The ball has a good enough grip for a smaller guy.  I've only used the ball indoors so I can't comment on other reviewers who have said that the ball lost it's grip.  For all of our indoor play, the ball has been fine.  But I can see that playing outdoors, the ball would get more gritty and eventually lose it's tackiness.

Then again, it stays inflated, is a nice ball and goes through the hoop.  No complaints from me.  If you play a lot, I would give some of the other reviews some more credibility though.  Sounds like the soft tack fades.",3.0
"Nice looking basketball and does have that tacky feel for better grip. It is ready to go straight from the box. Although it can be played indoors or out, it seemed to do better indoors for us. We worry about the tackiness getting dirty outside and losing its grip but my grandson likes it well enough and he and his dad have great fun with it. He tries to play with me but I am not very good. For the price, a good investment.",3.0
"Very easy to assemble and looks good. The  2 Problems I have are it is so light weight I can move the entire net a few inches with a backhander and close to a foot with a wrist shot.  This won't be a problem with kids and early teens though.
I also don't like how the plastic material that is attached to the netting touches the ground. It will probably rip the first time it freezes.",3.0
Its a nice net if ur just starting out and not shooting very hard but it can't handle pucks or green biscuits. My net already has holes and the plastic pipes come undone from each other which is annoying but for some street hockey with a ball or something i could imagine it would last a long time. However if ur into hockey and have a decent shot or just looking to use pucks i would spend the extra $$$ to get a metal or steel net.,3.0
For a beginner or young hockey player this net would be a great purchase. For older and higher powered hockey players looking for shooting practice this is not the net for you. The PVC has held up well against regulation and street hockey pucks but almost every shot that is taken goes right through the netting. I have put a blanket behind it to stop from hitting my house. Also when hitting the bottom cross bar decently hard the PVC comes apart. For the money its a great net and if you are using soft pucks or balls it will work fine. If you are looking for something to use in pick up games or with regulation pucks you should look into a better net.,3.0
"This is a good quality indoor-outdoor basketball.  The texture is soft and very easy to grip when new, with deep seams allowing excellent ball control.  Regulation size (29.5).  Being soft, it's not Spalding's most durable outdoor ball--the Street model may be more durable if you play outdoors all the time, and the tack on this one does wear off after a couple of dozen hours on cement.  Indoors, it'll last forever and stay nice and grippy. It needed a little air when I received it, but otherwise, I'm totally satisfied with it.  (Although not a big deal, I also happen to like the rich leather-like color more than the brighter orange of some balls.)

UPDATE: After a couple of years of infrequent use, the ball started to fall apart when I used it--the rubber deteriorated so that playing with it caused the pavement to quickly grind it off.",3.0
"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good, affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the ""tack"" on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:

Weight: C- , could definitely have been heavier

Inflate Quality - B+ , Holds air well

Feel - B+, more tacky than other basketballs, but feels great

Bounce - B, Good

Overall - B+

Durability - C- , I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.

Good quality ball for the indoors, recommended.",3.0
The net is pvc piping.  Its it huge and looks a lot bigger than a regulation nhl usa net. Sometimes the piping gets loose and falls out of its hole. Its got a terrible manual and its pretty hard to put together.  But its can take shots well. I use franklin high density hockey balls,3.0
I ordered 5 for my youth basketball team.  4 of the 5 are great...one won't hold air.  Overall I'm disappointed in the purchase.  Feel like I should have purchased at a local sporting goods store.,3.0
I've had this ball for a few days and so far I'm a little disappointed. When I tried it in Modells the grip felt great but after a few times playing on an outdoor court the ball does not have much grip. I wouldn't say that it lost the grip but I've noticed that it attracts so much dirt and dust and it all comes off on your hand. So the ball becomes slippery and so do your hands. I would choose a different one unless it would only be used on an indoor court.,3.0
"Decent basketball for the price, its tacky with a nice grip, but kind of light. I would spend a little more for a better quality ball, but I won't complain because I didn't want to spend that extra money.",3.0
as a family we have mixed feelings about these. One of my children and I like these but other child who is a serious swimmer hates them. I think it has to do with personal preference and face shape. over all they work fine for 2/3 of us.,3.0
"It fits perfectly. It was my second purchase of swim goggle as the previous one I needed to return back. So, yes, happy with this one.",3.0
"These goggles were really great, I needed a pair for my swim team. The strings it came with were kind of annoying and hard to adjust, so I used my own adjustable strings, and the second day of use the straps ripped through the rubber holes on the side. It was a real bummer. However, the three hours total ive used the goggles were lovely, they didn't fog up much, they were clear, and they didn't let water in at all.",3.0
"These are decent goggles at a low price point but do have some major flaws.

I didn't expect too much based on the price point but was looking for some decent goggles for my 2x per week swim workouts.  Lesson learned: you get what you pay for.  They do fit fairly well and don't irritate my eyes; however, the anti-fog coating worked for about 2 weeks (4 swim sessions) and there is no retainer for the excess strap so it just flaps around in the water.  I've never had a pair fo goggles without some way to retain the strap.  The only option on these is to cut off the exces which is a hassle and prevents and adjustments down the road.

These are okay for your kids playing around but not recommended for serious swimming or swim workouts.",3.0
They're good except sometimes they fog up and I have to stop to rub the inside of the goggles. I thought they were not suppose to fog up.,3.0
Didn't suction to my face very well. I can swim at a moderate pace in them but I can't even flip turn without it immediately filling with water. Works fine for casual swimmers though.,3.0
"They are good for practice when we aren't diving and simply just warming up. However, no matter how tight i put them, they WILL fall off during a meet when you dive in. I can assure you that my dive isn't wrong at all. I have been swimming for 4 years, very competetive swimmer.",3.0
"Not so much anti- fog. They're easy to adjust and suit their purpose, which is indoor swimming.",3.0
"The fit is great, but the gaskets warp after a couple of weeks. I've written to Speedo to complain. Their original Hydrospex didn't warp (no doubt weren't made in China). I sent a photo of the warped gaskets to Speedo but they ignored my email.
Expect to replace these once a month or two, if you swim often, and be REALLY careful not to let the gaskets press up against anything or you'll be sorry!!",3.0
"Good while it lasted...A year now wearing these,  The goggles now let water in,  The rubber seals have worn out and I need new ones.",3.0

"I bought this pair of goggles because it was prime and had blue tint specs, but these goggles were not as good as the darker blue tinted goggles. They get the job done.. Provided some relief from the sun.",3.0
"I bought these for general-purpose pool swimming, based on good reviews and high sales ranking.  While they seem to be decently made, they are way too small for my face.  As a result they were uncomfortable, and leaked unless I had them on ridiculously tight  My wife (who has smaller facial features) uses them now and seems to like them.

Another issue is the strap adjustment -- the Aqua Sphere googles I bought to replace these have a ratcheting model that's much easier to use.",3.0
It's okay. Nothing special.,3.0
"Average fit/comfort, nothing special.  Do not overpay for these!",3.0
"Fits well, but it is definitely not anti-fog",3.0
"I swim lengths three times a week. The pool water irritates my eyes. The Speedo swim goggles are well made, but I'm having difficulty getting them to fit properly. They don't seem to be large enough to fit over my eye sockets comfortably and fog up on the inside. They do keep my eyes from getting irritated.",3.0
"Speedo has never let me down. This seems like a good product, however, This model in particular doesn't fit my fat head",3.0
"I have a wide and large head and these feel a bit on the small side. I had some hydrospex in the past (white/blue) that fit great so I thought I would be in the clear, but I am a bit disappointed.",3.0
"they are leaking after maybe a year or so. I keep them in a case in the back of a vehicle, swim 3 times a week, and it almost seems that the eye cups got warped. the next pair i may just throw in the bag like my old speedos and they worked great for a decade at least.",3.0
Please take note of the size when ordering these. I thought I was buying an adult pair but the pair I received is for youth and does not come with any way to adjust the bridge.,3.0
I supposed these are ok but because they seem bigger and look uglier than my existing pair I have never worn them. Price and specs were pretty good if I remember.,3.0
"too tight at the nose.  not a bad goggle, just not right for me.",3.0
worked well.  Poor fit for my small ears.  I modified it with a grinder.,3.0
They're ok. They get foggy after just 15 minutes of use. But I guess this is the problem with all the goggles. Sometimes they would not stick and water would come in....,3.0
"So far so good. Lasted 2 seasons. When they fail, fail fast.",3.0
"I'm currently on my 3rd pair of these goggles and they have messed up as well.  On all 3 pair, the internal anti-fog coating has peeled off.  I have only been swimming for 2 months and I'm about to pick up my 4th pair.  I swim in an indoor pool, 3-5 times per week, usually an hour each time.  With the first pair, I actually tried to clean the inside but found out quickly that was the wrong thing to do (my fault).  The 2nd pair, I never touched the inside and I used the Speedo Anti-Fog cleaner/coating and rinsed with cold water.  Those lasted less than 1 week.  The 3rd pair got the same treatment as the 2nd pair and the anti-fog coating started to peel off yesterday (using for 3 weeks).  As long as Sports Authority keeps replacing them, I'll keep using them.  If not, I'll try something else.  They are quite comfortable to wear and keep water out, basically all the things I was thinking that they would do (from a novice swimmer's point of view)",3.0
"Used for about 7 weeks at this point around maybe 17 hours of use, great when I first started using it. But now the goggles keep getting fogged up after swimming as short as 25 meters making me have  to wipe it every 50 meters. And when I need fogged up I mean I can't even see 6 meters in front of me. A little disappointed, but I guess that what I paid for.",3.0
i would spend a little more on some better goggles..,3.0
It worked really well the first 6-7 times. It started fogging up a little after that. It's great for the price though.,3.0
I am an adult man on the large side (but not huge) and these seem too small to form a proper seal on my face/head.  They work okay for my purposes (swimming laps) but don't work for diving/going under water due to leaks around the eye seals.,3.0
"They worked well at first, but started letting in water after a few dozen uses in the pool.",3.0
Good item n Work perfectly at first. But starts fogging up easily after a month of using.,3.0
"These seem sturdy, they are easy to adjust, and they aren't as ridiculous-looking as some goggles. I think they would work great for most casual swimmers. They don't work for me, however. I have a Roman nose that's been broken a few times, combined with slightly deep set eyes. At first the goggles seemed fairly comfortable, but each time I pushed off from the wall they would let in some water. When I tightened the band enough to keep them watertight, they dug painfully into the bridge of my nose. After 20 minutes I couldn't stand to wear them and they had left deep red marks across my face from being so tight. I'm going to buy some goggles with an adjustable nose piece.

Verdict: The product is good, but works best for very average facial proportions.",3.0
These work good for only a little while then crack around the little holes around the goggles.,3.0
The googles were okay - I bought these and snorkling gear too - I eneded up using the snorkles more since I was mainly snorkling.. I will try to use these again when I am just swimming.,3.0
"It doesn't fix on Eyes very well. The water get into it once in a while. Also, there is no ability to change the interval between goggles.",3.0
Scratched after only 4 times in the pool. Very disappointed but otherwise works great.,3.0
"Initially it wouldn't fog but after about 6 weeks/12 times use, it's now starting fogging. Also, I feel it little small on my eyes and I'm a small frame guy weighing 145 lbs. Just to be fair, I always used a bigger eye piece goggle so not sure if the size is supposed to be this small on eyes for this type.",3.0
"Good swimming goggles and they don't ever leak on me, but they are very hard to adjust.",3.0
"The blue lens goggles do the job, but they are too dark for outdoor night swims.  I wish the gray lenses had been available in this model.  These are the goggles that fit me best in the adult size.",3.0
"it says fog free, but if I swim for an hour, i get blurred view in the goggles.  It get moisture very easily.",3.0
For up pretty quickly above water. Not very foggy underwater. Great for swimming laps. Not great for above water eye protection.,3.0
"nice goggles, but the nose bridge is way too small. It doesn't fit me.",3.0
"I always keep them in my gym bag in my car so I won't forget them.  However, they melted.  The plastic around the lenses and nose piece is soft and will easily melt in a hot car.  I live in Maryland where the summer temps can reach into the 80s in the early summer.",3.0
I ordered the incorrect sizw,3.0
Used several units and the rubber portion turns yellow over 3-4 months of continuous use.  Wonderful for the first 1-2 months.  Very comfortable,3.0
"This is a good looking, swin google, but I think it is not easy to adjust,I bought the blue lenses and sometimes I couldn't see. I prefer to buy another from other mark. I don't not recommend it.",3.0
"its okay, but it comes off too easy for me.  Also the fitting around my nose is not comfortable. shipping was great",3.0
The straps is always having to be adjusted.  As a swimming instructor it is very irritating to have to adjust my goggles all the time.,3.0
The nose piece on these goggles is unnecessarily thick and inflexible.  The result is that this rubs on the bridge of my nose and it is difficult to make a seal due to the inflexibility.,3.0
"I love that these googles do not fog up, but the nose bridge is uncomfortable.  I would not purchase these again.",3.0
"Third pair - used for tri training. One pair split right at in the middle, but these are the only goggles that fit my odd face/head. Lens clarity is good, seals well without having to cinch it up too tight.",3.0
"No complaints, other than the fit of the nosepiece.  It's a thick, fixed piece of plastic that makes my forehead and bridge of my nose sore after about twenty minutes.  These low-priced goggles would be just fine for occasional use at a swim meet, but for longer-duration exercise I'll get something with a narrower, more-flexible or adjustable nosepiece.",3.0
Im not sure if I just wasn't putting it on correctly but the eye pieces put to much pressure on the bridge of my nose...I'll be looking for replacements.,3.0
"I have been using Speedo Pacific Storm goggles for years but was having trouble finding a replacement. These seemed somewhat similar. The fit around the eye socket is fine, although I found they pressed into the bridge of my nose a little. The biggest downfall is the strap. It's a very awkward buckle to adjust and, in trying to loosen the strap, it began to break. I've since found another pair of Pacific Storm so these will go in my kit bag for emergencies. But I wouldn't recommend them.",3.0
A little bit of water gets in over the course of a swim  but generally it does the job.  For the cost it is OK.,3.0
"The non adjustable nose bridge really doesn't work for me, it is too tight and really hurts after swimming even for a couple of minutes, They might be perfect for some, but not for everyone. I'll keep looking.",3.0
Good cheap option for occasional use. Water does start to get in after a while and the spit trick to keep them from fogging worked for me. No regrets here.,3.0
These are budget goggles. I use them for swimming 30 minutes once a week. They work fine. They don't have a strap to hold the extra length that comes from the band - kind of annoying. They work fine though for the price.,3.0
"The first dozen or so times all was fine. Then the straps began to stretch out, and the lens began to leak. I swim 3 miles a week, so they got alot of use. But, they were supposed to be fog resistant for up to a year by warranty, and the fog prevention was gone WAY before that.
Before the started to deteriorate, about 5 weeks, they fit well. But I expected the antifog to last way longer.",3.0
"Like the title states, they are not bad glasses. Really they're better than not bad but lets not get ahead of ourselves they're also not great. For an occasional swimmer here and there they are perfect. Just keep them clean and in a safe place and they shall last. For someone like me who goes through spurts of swimming a few times a week to then none and then back to a couple times a week due to work they being to wear an tear. I truly don't mind as they are beyond reasonably priced so i'll get another pair again when these finally crap out. Though if you're planning and are already swimming regularly get a more expensive and sturdier styled goggle.",3.0
"I'm sure that these will work, functionally, just fine. However, they aren't very comfortable. They have a 'suction cup' effect, which kind of pulls your eye balls out a bit....I have a pair of Nike goggles that are more comfortable.

I will say, that the suction makes them more secure on your face. I will use these for open water swimming if there's any chance for rough water b",3.0
"The seal around the eyes works great and the quality is good, however the solid bridge on the goggle tends to rub on the bridge of my nose.  Perhaps this will lessen if I get the tension on the straps figured out.",3.0
We use these and have to cut them in half. I've ordered these exact ones before. And the color is blue. And the others I ordered were black,3.0
Wore just have a few uses,3.0
"I purchased these balls to be used for gifts for the Little league baseball team.  Each boy signs each ball and everyone gets one with all the kids' names on it.  I wanted to get good quality balls to represent a quality team.  These balls are noticeably blemished with scuff marks, dents, and enlarged holes in the stitching.  In regards to using them for practice, I haven't done that yet with the extras as I have a few.  The scuff marks would not be an issue but a few of the balls have dents that will certainly effect play.  Before the season I purchased the Wilson A1030 3-Dozen Bucket of Baseballs on sale on Amazon for $105.  MUCH better set of balls with most of them unnoticeably blemished and no dents.  Even though they are currently about $30 more it is worth the extra cost.",3.0
"Cooler is good at keeping food cold. I used it over a 3 day camping trip for my dog's raw meat. It held 6 2lb rolls, that started out frozen. I added ice on the 2nd day and that held til I arrived home the next night. I only gave it a 3 star rating because of the locking system. It does not provide a tight fit on the lids. I ended up using 3 or 4 damp paper towels on the top and closing the lid onto them. Only then did the lid close tightly.",3.0
Not the size that we thought.  But it looked well made and probably would have been great for another purpose.  We wanted to use it for taking lunches.  Liked that it was made in the USA.  But we returned it because not what we thought it was.,3.0
"it will hold 14 cans but leaves little room for ice! But It does work for what i needed for, just needs alittle more insulation!",3.0
"Great cooler, loses 2 stars due to the sticker Rubber maid outs on the front. Upon a time consuming & painstaking removal, there is now a  big white patch of color distortion where the sticker was.",3.0
Great product just wish the clasp where the straps are attached was more sturdy.,3.0
"This cooler was the size I expected but as a couple of other reviews mentioned, the carrying strap seems a bit flimsy. All in all a decent buy though.",3.0
"Although this is a neat concept for a cooler, overall it didn't work for me, and is being returned.
Pros:
Very Insulated
Nice shape if you have a narrow spot

Cons,
Beyond the shoulder strap there is no carrying handle.  I do not see this strap standing up to long use
The shape of the cooler is very awkward when carried by the strap.  I think a shoulder strap is a great idea but this one would only be helpful for a short distance.
The top opens in the middle, which I initially thought was a great idea.  However, there is not a strong clasp, so I think it might let warm air in over time and cause spillage if the cooler gets knocked over.
The cup holders are very shallow, so I think they would only work if the cooler was totally level.is on a level surface.",3.0
"needed a cooler to fit behind the driver seat when we travel, it is difficult to carry, but fits our need.",3.0
"I'm disappointed, I thought this bike would speak hirer being a Huffy. I am wrong in various ways. I put the bike together and then out of fifteen gears, I have five. The bike looks very cool and is a self assemble,but I am not happy to have to take it to a bike shop to pay for adjustments. I decided to ride the bike for a while and then the front rim bent. This happened the same day the pedal fell off. Now I might not have tightened the pedal as tight as I should have, but that doesn't explain for a bent rim. I've riden a Schwinn for years and not once have I bent a rim. I think I'll be modifying this bike quite a bit. Its not the worst bike in the world for a 100 bucks , but I plan on spending more. So, if you want to buy a cheap bike and have enough cash for some modifications, this is a good one. I'm not trying to say anything againt AMAZON or the seller. Huffy/Made in China",3.0
"Worked fine to keep insects away, but the scent was so strong my wife and I had to turn it off for a while.",3.0
"I was told this worked great for flies as well as mosquitos.  That is not the case.  Flies were still in the area, but we didn't have a more mosquitos so I guess it does do what it was made for.",3.0
Works as advertised but could not find info as to how to obtain the electrical adapter.  Have ordered more just hope it really works for the Bite season is upon us.,3.0
"We get mosquitos in the apartment at night as we live by the water.  They don't seem to bother my girlfriend, just me and the most annoying thing is when they buzz past my ear.  Tried the Bite Shield as when I lived in Europe, plug-in repellents work a treat.  This works to an extent, but the odd one still comes in.  It would seem the refills only really last one or two nights and then the smell is not so strong and the mozzys come in.  Rather than spend money on refills, we may as well shut the window and turn the air on!",3.0
"I'm on my second Bite Shield now...I had to return the first one because the fan didn't work while the unit was upright and who wants to carry a plastic box around all day long because you can't put it on your belt loop?!  Anyhow, this second unit is ""okay"", but I really don't think it's as useful as the product description suggests.  I admit I was only bitten once or twice while wearing this unit, but I was hoping that my skin would be off the ""all-u-can-eat mosquito buffet"" in my back yard.  I found the smell to be pleasant and very similar to the scent of citronella candles.  The fan on my second unit is much better, but it still kicks off on occasion so you really have to keep an eye on it.  I guess my biggest ""beef"" with this product is the fan...I don't understand why its operation is so flaky.  Poor product design, I suppose.  Anyhow, I gave it 3 stars because it did seem to discourage the mosquito full feeding frenzy, but you take your chances on getting a unit with a reliable fan!",3.0
"I couldn't really tell if the device was working or not. I took it with me to South India. It did not seem to pack much punch, but it was better than having nothing.",3.0
"I received this Lentek Model MM30, called Bite Shield yesterday afternoon and at around 4:30 PM I tested this thing in my back yard which a hiding place for some Asian Tiger mosquitos in Houston, Texas.  These pesky mosquitos are known to bite during daytime.  Within 5 minutes while testing in a light breeze of around 4 to 5 MPH one adult came by with three other smaller ones, despite of this Lentek running by my side.  I swatted the adult and two smaller ones by my palm when they started feeding on my left arm, but the other juvenile got away.  This morning, at 8:15 AM I tested it again in calm air and was surprised that one or two mosquitos will not land on my test arm.  I tested again this afternoon before sunset with calm air, and got bitten while this Lentek was running on my belt.  I came back inside my home scratching my left elbow.  I would just give this Lentek MM30 a 3-star rating at this place where these Asian Tiger mosquitos are plentiful.",3.0
Ball arrived quickly (love Amazon Prime) and was reasonably priced.  A little disappointing though that it ships a bit deflated so a pin/pump is a must before 1st use.,3.0
"This ball is fine when it's dry, but the slick surface makes handling impossible when wet.",3.0
"A bit disappointed after a month of use... Franklin usually makes nice products, but the stitching in this ball has been slowly coming out. It's pretty much unusable at this point.",3.0
A great soccer ball for the price!,3.0
"I relied on information from my oldest grandson (11) who has been casually playing soccer in the US and in Latin America since he was a toddler. He gives the ball three stars. According to grand, it's fine except for the stitching. He says that in his experience, soccer balls with visible stitching (as this has) fall apart much more quickly than soccer balls with the stitching on the inside. For practice, for fun, for five bucks (at the time of this writing) it's fine, he says. When I said it's an ""official competition soccer ball,"" he immediately said, ""No. It's not."" So says he. I'm just reporting the news.",3.0
"Cheap but cheerful. This is a decent soccer ball, not high end but that is reflected in the price.

BTW: Size 4 is for the younger kiddos, so beware, this is a smaller ball.",3.0
Pads dod not last too long. After a few falls the hard plastic pulled away from the nylon and I had to buy new pads elsewhere.,3.0
"These are a decent ball for $5-7 bucks.  I purchased multiple of the size 4 balls for shooting practice for our team.  These are a very inexpensive balls and have a cheap outer cover.  I would not suggest these balls as a kids daily practice ball.  Some issues I have they only suggest 5psi  of air when most balls suggest 7-9 psi.  The size is within FIFA specs but the balls seem light to me also.  On a good note the 4 that I bought do hold air well.  Where I have had mixed success with Adidas balls loosing air frequently.

My son has a choice of about half a dozen brands and types of balls to use on a daily basis and he prefers the Mikasa for feel and touch of ball.",3.0
This ball is nice to bring to the park over the weekend for some kicking practice. It's not made out of the same synthetic leather material you see in some other balls. In fact the high gloss material makes it very slippery to hold. It's soft though and bounces well. Mine came a bit under pressure  so I pumped it to about 9psi and it's perfect!,3.0
The gel part is pretty much just the colored dots in the photos.  I got these as an adult for my elbow since I fractured it and was looking for something to really help with potential impact while ice skating.  The elbows are too small and the knees too big for my elbow but it seems like they'll work.  I wouldn't recommend just getting them for the gel part since it's practically nonexistent.,3.0
good,3.0
They were not aired and once I did get them filled with air one had a leak and was unusable,3.0
Ball is NOT deflated (as in empty) but UNDER inflated.,3.0
just ok.....,3.0

"The description specifically said these were supposed to be deflated, but they came inflated, which was disappointing.  We bought them to take to kids in Guatemala, and we wanted them already deflated so transport there would be easier.  Most people probably would prefer have them come inflated though!  The quality of the stitching didn't look great, but what can you expect for this price?  I had hoped it would be a little better considering they are Franklin balls.",3.0
They turned out to be more than necessary for my 8 year old son.,3.0
I ordered these for my grandson and initially was very happy with them.  However after only wearing a few times they started coming apart.  Look good but poor quality.,3.0

"If your toddler is skinny these will not fit snug. I bought for 3 year old twins based on other reviews. It seemed they'd fit all sizes. They do attatch fine, but they are large and cumbersome on my kids. They slip because they are slightly too big.

Overall, they seem like a great product that will be an excellent fit for our kids when they are a bit bigger. I would guess these might fit better starting around 4.

For adult shoppers, these do fit me. I am 5'6"" and average build. They do not feel too tight or bothersome. They are very adjustable for adults, just not small enough for young kids.",3.0

"I am a petite 5'4"" woman, and though the elbow pads were all right, the knee pads were painfully small.  Little miffed that a search for adult pads brought these up, and that the description says this nowhere.",3.0
"Does the job, I still have skin on my joints. Being a fairly tiny person I ordered the small size, thinking they'd be designed for dudes, and they're rather tight, but not restrictive enough to warrant a return. Still, I'd recommend these as an economical way to avoid road rash.",3.0
"is not pro quality but they will def save your knees and elbows from the pavement; a set like this of good quality is over a hundred bucks, so for now this will do just fine.",3.0
I cannot believe there are no sleeve protector pads for toddlers. My kid refuses to wear these on his elbows during the summer on bare skin.,3.0
"We purchased these for our 4 year old twins when they got their first ""big boy bikes"" and they were quite large. They work great and are great quality, but we actually had to use the elbow pads for their knees and put the kneepads in storage for now.",3.0
The protection gel pads for knees and elbows is ok but a bit too tight or snug for my daughter to wear comfortably,3.0
the fitting on these pads is kind of small. Therefore it should be listed for kids or very small adults..,3.0
"Does what it's supposed to do.  It's a little bulkier than expected, but I guess that's to be expected.  Definitely protects the designed areas, just a little cumbersome getting used to them.",3.0
"well im 19 years old and i buy this but is not my size xddd
buy anyway no choice i sell it
this is kid stuff u,u",3.0
"These run a bit large. I bought them for my 5yr old, he's kinda thin and these swallow his elbows and knees. For that matter they may be able to fit me.",3.0
"I purchased these for my grandsons to use when riding their skateboards at my house.  The are a good product.  Nothing extraordinary but they do the trick.  The Velcro straps allows you to adjust to different leg and arm sizes but if you are using them on bare skin, they can rub a little.  Either way, it's better than falling on the concrete with NO protection.",3.0
These are nice cushy pads for the kids. The only problem was the threading. I had to re sew the Velcro on almost all of them which was a tough and a nuisance.,3.0
"It' came in a great pack, and it was delivered on time. It fits my five year old daughter quite well. Looks well made too and therefore I assume it will be durable.",3.0
They fit kinda weird. Can't really wear them on bare skin since they have sharp edges... they do what they're supposed to but I would definitely not buy pads online. I would want to try them on in a store.,3.0
"...but to tell the truth, I'm a little bit miffed about the velcro detaching on one of the places that the straps attach to. Other than that, these are pretty darn decent. But on the pair that I have, I now have to reattach the velcro.

Would I purchase these again, for my 6 year old son? Sure, the velcro is a minor point (or sorts), but I still feel that something like this kind of serves as an indicator of other things that we all think shouldn't go wrong, that do. Imagine being on vacation and the velcro coming loose. It would pretty much make these unusable for the duration. Just one of those things that really is not supposed to happen. All in all, they are still pretty decent material, and should live up to the tests trials and tribulations of a 6 year old boy...and when he grows out of them, his sister will probably punish them even more, as will her younger sister, as well. Yeah, I kind of expect a bit of longevity out of these.",3.0
"I bought these at the suggestion of another product by amazon, but they are to big and bulky for my nine year old daughter and she doesn't like wearing them. I also as a grown up think they are a little scratchy.",3.0
"This is a basic set of pads, but they are far too large for my little guy.  They do have the hook and loop straps which make them wearable, but they keep moving around.  I can't depend on them for safety so much yet, but the are doing the trick for him as far as being a good stand in (we wear a helmet and pads when we bike).  Since he can't get faster than a step on his balance bike, it is not a big worry.

They aren't advertised as being for his small size, but these were the best option I could find for him.  I do think we'll get a lot of use out of them once he gets bigger.

Now if someone would just make something he could wear 24-7, then I'd feel better.",3.0
Bought these for my 5 year old after reading reviews. They are HUGE and meant for older kids. Fell off my sons knees they were so big.,3.0
"These are good quality very durable.. so wondering why I only gave a 3 star. They seem extremely bulky for my 6yo and I was hoping they were a little more tailored for his size, he is average for his age so I was surprised. Maybe they will be better on long sleeves and pants... but then bummer kind of the point. Good news is that he will grow in to them.. if he will wear them that is.",3.0
I recently started long boarding and got these to soften the falls.  I have only used them a few times but the pad is starting to rip off and the Velcro strap is a little bit to long for my liking.  If your looking for a cheap set of pads this is the way to go.,3.0
My son (5 Yrs old) can't wear these since they are kinda bulky...they are adjustable but really he didn't really need them since it made it harder to peddle. My daughter (2 Yrs Old) used the set of elbow pads on her knees since they were smaller but she didn't wear them for long as well.,3.0
Does the job! Easy on and off. Comes with a nice bag for storage. Works for me and the kids.,3.0
"The rating isn't ment to degrade the product. They are very needed when using the inline skates, just don't have the WOW factor",3.0
"Although my grandchildren preferred not to wear these, because they were a it combersome, I think that they would serve the purpose just fine to prevent bruises.",3.0
"A good product, but too big for my 6-year-old daughter who is about 46"" tall.  Information for those who aren't sure about the fit.  Some reviews wrote it fit their younger children so I purchased it hoping it would fit her.  She can probably use them within 6-12 months.",3.0
i just needed knee and elbow pads to complete a costume i was making for halloween and they worked just fine.,3.0
"My brother ordered these for my son to go with the scooter he got for his 3rd birthday. They're too big for him, he's literally right in the middle range for a 3 year old in height and weight. The elbow pads would have probably worked on his knees but that defeats the purpose of having the set so exchanging them for something that will be more likely to work as a set.",3.0
"I bought thinking it would be a good buy. This product does not fit well. they take a long time to put on and off. I am not happy with this product at all. My advise,do not buy",3.0
"I bought this for my 2 year old son.  When it arrived I put it together myself.  I could have probably waited and got some help.  Is very hard to put together.  I ordered it because it didn't have springs.  I would NEVER disassemble to store.  Way to hard to put together and it looked even worse to take apart.  Every time I lay it flat for him to jump on I have to get on it to flatten it, and it still seems a little wobbly and uneven.  Maybe I put it together wrong!!  Otherwise it is great.  Has a nice spring to it!",3.0
"Not *too* difficult to put together. It's been used a LOT and now the seam is starting to rip on the blue pad. The rest of it is holding up well though.

**editing to add - after a few months of the kids using the trampoline the pad has huge rips in it; it has not held up well at all! However the jumping surface itself seems to be holding up quite nicely.",3.0
"About to throw this trampoline out, several months after purchase, all parts of trampoline became loose, and parts falling off on its own.",3.0
"My pre-teen daughter decided on this with her Christmas GC and it's been super fun. She loves it: puts her music on and jumps away. Um...I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 only because durring set up, we almost lit it on fire and threw it in the ocean. It's not easy to put together.",3.0
Hard to bounce on this. My 4 year old loves to bounce but not on this. She doesn't get any air.,3.0
"This is a good exercise trampoline for small and/or light people, but definitely wouldn't recommend for anyone over 120lbs if you plan to use it regularly. It lasted a couple of years with infrequent use by a 5' 100lb person, but the elastic started going out once it got more frequent use by others who were taller and weighed more.",3.0
My boys love it! Although a bit off centered. The legs are not balanced which makes it a bit wobbly.,3.0
"Smaller than I expected. Really hard to put together.
It's super tight and barely bounces but maybe it'll loosen up with use.",3.0
"Yes, this trampoline is cheap compared to other models. But I don't think anyone could honestly enjoy this much. There is hardly any bounce to it when you jump and it made it uncomfortable for me to the point where now I just let my dog sleep on it. I'd skip it if I could do it again.",3.0
"Does what it's suppose to do, but was very tricky to get together. Hard to get the frame together. Mine appeared to have a slight bend which ade it difficult to assemble. Looked like I received someone's returned item. Paint was scraped off of some of the metal pieces as if someone attempted to put it together and took it apart. The straps do tend to fray.",3.0
It is ok but I wish I had spend a bit more for a better quality product.,3.0
"This was a pain to put together.  It never seemed to be completely level.  We've had ours for about 8 months now.  It's been kept inside the entire time.  The blue cover started ripping right away, I eventually took it off and threw it away.  The legs constantly come loose, now one of our legs is stripped and won't tighten any longer.  That being said we bought it for our 3 year old for his birthday and he has loved jumping on it.  Considering the price I would probably buy it again.",3.0
"4-2016 Update: Less than a year old, two of the rubber bands have come away from their stitching.  Tramp used daily.
*****************
12-2015 Legs keep coming unscrewed.  Had to add Plumber's Teflon Tape to leg threads to keep them from working loose.  Rubber bands rub against folding joints causing friction and fraying of the bands.  Had to apply duct tape to frame to aid in smoothness of contact there.  Allen bolts keep coming unscrewed from underneath tramp from the bouncing.  Had to add lock washers in order to make them tighter and lock them in place.
*****************
6-2015 Quiet.  Great for exercising in front of TV or while others are watching or listening to music.  Only light people can use this.  Kids and lighter adults.  Only a 200 Lb limit.",3.0
"Fine for jogging in place or little kids to bounce on, but it's like bouncing on a cushion--good give, but no return.  Do not expect a trampoline-like experience.  Ok for the price.  Assembly as described by others.  Mediocre quality construction.",3.0
Putting together can be a challenge but just takes patience. I was almost done but then one of the lips broke. Trying to exchange it now. I got it for my 6 year old to burn some energy off. I'm glad it broke on me and not on him while jumping!,3.0
You will need a couple of strong individuals to assemble,3.0
They don't tell you it takes 3 people to put it together. It looks great but need people to help me!,3.0
"Even though all screws are not necessarily and tightened, the frame is still a bit wobbly.",3.0
My daughters are 50 pounds and 40 pounds. They were too rough with it. But I want it for me,3.0
Not really impressed Constantly have to straighten the joints. kind of annoying.,3.0
Tramp arrived promptly but some parts needed to assemble it were missing from shipment.  It was tricky and stressful to put it together.,3.0
Never used it. Gave it to the grandkids -- they didn't use it often.,3.0
"There is no spring in this trampoline.  So the bounce is limited.  The assembly process was OK, but you definitely need 2 people to do it.  It even says that on the instruction booklet.  Overall, for the price, this is a decent deal.  However, if you are looking for a high bouncing trampoline, look for something else.",3.0
"I bought this trampoline as it was one of the cheapest deals out there. I will tell you that if you were scared of the old some assembly required merchandise then you should stay clear of this completely. I am very well apt to putting things together in this thing gave me a real run for my money. It fought me all the way.  Once the items put together it is very nice, but if you are not mechanically inclined person get something else.",3.0
"The blue cover does not fit around the frame very well!! Its floppy, and doesnt add much protection. Also, make sure the legs are screwed on tight, or they will bend!",3.0
"Cool trampolines. At 48 inches, they're pretty good sized. They're not as bouncy as the real big outdoor trampolines, but they're still fun to bounce around on. Bought these for my son and daughter who were 8 and 7 at the time.

*Update* - we've had these for 4 years now. Have had issues with the legs falling off and now one won't stay threaded in.",3.0
"I may be back to review this later to say how it's held up.  It took 3 of us to put it together, and I was a little afraid of it springing up & clocking one of us, but that is also clearly spelled out in the instructions.  So that was not a big deal to me.  It's not quite as ""springy"" as I was hoping, but my 14 yr old is happy with it so that's fine by me.  We'll probably use it more in the summer, so I'll update after we've put it to use.",3.0
My package came without the instruction manual or the nuts and bolts required to assemble it.,3.0
"The children love to jump on it and it's fine for 2 of them to jump on at once, or even one of the kids and I, but one of the joints has been almost broken from the beginning, so it doesn't stay straight, it curves up with one or two legs in the air. We turn it over and straighten it and tighten it, but it keeps happening. I can't fix it now after 2 months, as it seems it finally finished breaking. We could not return it from the beginning because we are in Belize and shipping back would cost more than it is worth.",3.0
"We left this outside to be our kids trampoline, but the legs began to bend after a few months. The main frame isn't flat either.  They still use it, but I am just waiting for it to break.  It wasn't left in the grass to get wet from the sprinklers.  We leaned it up against the house each night, so it wouldn't get wet.  I guess it isn't meant to be outside?",3.0
Quality is okay.,3.0
"This was extremely difficult to assemble.
Also, after several jumps, the frame starts to bend out of shape, and you have to straighten it out.
However, it's been a lifesaver over the winters when the kids start to get cabin fever!",3.0
"Got this to do a little bit of jumping as an exercise and it is not too bad, mildly annoying to put together and not as comfortable as I would like but it still does what its meant for. Mild harshness to the jump but its what you expect from a 38$ mini trampoline. Still good though for the price.",3.0
"My first thought when I got this trampoline was: this is a TOY, not a FITNESS trampoline. I'm a newbie to rebounding and didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars for a professional-grade trampoline. Well, that was my mistake. If you have kids, this is a fine trampoline. It is sturdy enough, has bands instead of springs, and nobody is going to be able to jump high enough to really hurt themselves. The safety people will probably bust me for saying this, but I find it safe enough to use indoors if you have enough space.

That said, you aren't going to jump very high on this. Instead of springs or bungees it has these pseudo-stretchy fabric bands that seem very strong and durable, but they don't give much and provide a very firm bounce, not a high bounce or a very springy bounce. This can be stressful on the joints and is also not as much fun. It's sturdy and not going to fall apart, but if you buy it for fitness you will probably be disappointed.

On a side note, I didn't have any trouble putting it together. My husband and I put it together in about fifteen minutes. He stood on the frame while I pried it open and bolted it in place.",3.0
took forever to put together and sometimes the bar moves so that it is uneven. i just have to flip it over and fix that.,3.0
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. The reason for the lower rating is two fold. First, despite the description, it is not that easy to put together. While you do not need special tools it does require 3 adults and some strength to assemble. Second, it has a very odd smell. I routinely spray it with febreeze because it makes the whole room smell, and it is in a very large open area. I don't even know how to describe the smell. The closest thing I can think is like burnt plastic. Very funky.",3.0
Well what it says it means it takes three people to put together.we have enjoyed but it keeps buckling it easy to fix but a pain.,3.0
An 11 year old girl has worn it out already. It lasted longer than the Marcy Trampoline. I wish I could find one that will withstand being used by a little girl.,3.0
"Good thus far in usability, but physically difficult to assemble. Warning : Device will physically 'attack' back during assembly. Not for the faint of heart.",3.0
"This was hard to put together.  The instruction sheet said you may need three people, but I didn't pay it any mind.  I tried to build it with my husband and it was a challege.  We got it do as a team and it works.  It does have a rubber sell to it which im waiting to go away.  Main point, you need a team to get this thing together.",3.0
"If I could afford one of the $300 mini trampoline's, it would probably be better on my body, but it does get my heart rate up before work in the morning. Pretty sturdy for the price, too.",3.0
It was bigger than I imagined (not their fault) and it was received where you had to put the top together...not easy.(took 3 people).,3.0
"This is definitely on the cheap side.  And it will take 2 people to put this together.  There's not much bounce, I weigh 150 and it goes a pretty good way towards the floor so I work out on the outer edge.  I would send it back but more trouble than it's worth.  I still use it 3 times a week.  If I did it over, I would just get the spring ones at the local exercise outlet.  But this will work in the mean time and it is a little smaller than the spring version.",3.0
The shipping was great. Got here sooner than expected. The product itself is mediocre. It's not as springy as I thought it would be. It has elastic bands instead of springs. And half the legs were the wrong size so they wouldn't screw on. I would not recommend this to anyone.,3.0
"I bought this for my son a while back. It has never broken, but the legs sure do like to bend. I find myself stretching the metal frame back out from time to time. My son absolutely loves it. He will jump off couches, onto the trampoline, and onto the floor. It's taken more abuse than I thought possible. It's just that the bending of the frame makes me worry, and that's why I've taken off two stars. My son has never hurt himself as a direct cause of the trampoline. As for what he bounces towards? That's a different matter.",3.0
"I love the size of it, but it wants to bend in the center, it won't hold it's shape. Put it together as instructions said.",3.0
"I am loving the trampoline workout.  I had to buy another one but this trampoline wasn't made for someone 150lbs. I gave it to my daughter 40lbs, and she loves it.",3.0
"The 38"" size is a good deal for the price and works okay.  I did manage to put it together all by my lonesome instead of the 3 people the directions say are needed.  But... The chemical odor from the blue stretch cover is AWFUL.  I am going to stick this thing outside to see if that helps air it out.  If not, the cover is coming off.  It is too strong to use right now and that is why the 3 stars.  Nothing made for living creatures should smell that horrible.  I refuse to use it further until the smell is gone.

I'd love to hear if others have had this issue.",3.0
"I have a jumping bean for a child and Santa brought her this for Christmas.  We like the bands, I was worried about springs and injuries.  It does fold in half for transport or storage or something and those screws and the legs need to be tightened regularly.  We have had it for 6 months now and the bounce has not weakened.  It is a huge hit with the little one.",3.0
This product was hard to assemble and required two adults.  My major complaint is that all the legs are crooked.  It is functional and works fine but looks like it is broken.,3.0
"It's okay for it's price, but I can never get it to stay completely flat and it always bends a little in the places it was put together.",3.0
"My neighbor kid was jumping on it and it bent the frame and the legs. She's 7yrs old and 45 pounds, well under the weight limit. Not very impressed with that, but my husband has been able to bend it back into shape.",3.0
"We found the cover on the trampoline to stretch out quickly.  We had to tighten the trampoline where it folds and when we put the cover back on, it was so stretched out that it wasn't properly covering the bands and spaces between the bands.",3.0
"I like that it is quiet and I don't have to listen to squeaky springs any more.
I'm not sure how long it will last. Doesn't want to sit level.
But for the price it was a deal. I won't feel bad when it breaks.",3.0
"Got this trampoline a few months ago. In spite of the warnings in the reviews, it was very easy to put together.
The trampoline seems pretty sturdy  -  It is used by a 105lb person and the workouts are vigorous at times.  Unfortunately, like any cheap products, will not give a great performance. Instead of jumping up and down with no support (which seems to give me some back  aches) I prefer either holding onto a sturdy surface with my hands while doing different leg exercises or trying to keep in balance while doing the routine I'd do at the gym with medium weights.
All in all, this trampoline either gives you the taste for a more expensive/better quality product or it discourages your long term commitment to rebounding.",3.0
It takes great upper body strength to put together and the help I have asked for has not found time to help. I am sure it will be fine to change up my workouts someday soon,3.0
"Says you have to have help putting it together; I did it by myself but I could see where it could be dangerous by yourself. You assemble two half-moon sides by slipping the mat on, stretching it out flat and screwing in some connector bolts. It was hard to keep it flat while putting on the connectors and maybe I did it wrong. (Although I am able to follow directions and build things all the time.) Then you put on the blue cover, then screw on the legs. However, this trampoline wants to warp and try to fold up, so every time I use it, I have to turn it upside down, flatten it out and carefully turn it back right side up, otherwise the opposite sides' legs will be off the ground. Annoying. I would rather have one made in a different way. But it is useful as is, works fine for jogging in front of my Wii-Fit  as I 'bike' around the Island. Maybe two people putting it together can get the connector bolts and the connector plates to hold it flat. It is lightweight and easy to pick up and store on edge in a closet. And it makes a great dog bed for an old achy dog.",3.0
the trampoline works great but i can't get rid of the awful cheap cancerous smeling rubber tips on the legs.  i don't use the blue cover around it - it looks really pasticky and cheap.  overall however the trampoline works great and is sturdy,3.0
"Well, unfortunately I waited to long to return this.  It has a weird smell that almost makes you sick...I figured I'd leave it in the garage for awhile and hopefully the smell would go away.  However, I want to use it inside my house....I brought it back in thinking the smell had dissipated; but it hadn't.  It is terrible.  Plus, the tension is not very good on the trampoline...

This is an addendum which I am adding after several more months.  After awhile, the smell does dissipate.  If you get fairly close or are using it, you can still smell it; but at least it doesn't fill the whole room with odor.  I guess now, I'm glad I kept it...so I would consider it a fair buy.",3.0
"it broke within a week, but we just straighten the legs out each time and it's usable. my girl loves it, but it's pretty unstable.",3.0
after a year & a half of near daily use the webbing is showing signs of splitting - but otherwise has worked well,3.0
"This trampoline was really cheap by comparison so I'm not going to hold it to a high standard.  A great thing about it is how quiet it is compared to my old one due to it using nylon/elastic bands around the frame instead of springs.  This alone gives it at least three stars in my view.  Assembly wasn't too bad either.

My main problem with it is the size.  It is advertised as being 38 inches and that is simply not the case.  The interior dimension of the surface on which you would jump is 31 1/2 inches in diameter.  Even the exterior dimension is less than 38 inches (not that it matters.  Who the heck really cares about the outer size when shopping for one of these?  Lame.

Because it is so small I would hardly recommend it, but for the price if you are careful to remain centered then it is passable.",3.0
"I wanted to buy a small trampoline for health purposes, as I read that it is good for the lymphatic system. This trampoline is not nearly as springy as others I have jumped on, as it does not have springs--yet that also makes it safer for my four year old to be around and to jump on. Also, about six months in the blue out part got a small tear in it. So, this is certainly not the best re bounder, but it is affordable and it gets the job done.",3.0
"We ordered this thinking that it would be similar to a trampoline we purchased from a local sporting goods store a few years back. Our previous trampoline came almost fully assembled. All we had to do was attach the legs. We had to assemble the ring for this trampoline, which came in four parts. To assemble the ring, you create two half circles, place the two half circles at 90 degree angles to one another, and then fold/flatten out the half circle to make a whole circle. It took two adults and two upper elementary kids to stretch the trampoline material enough to flatten out the circle and complete the ring. Also, the blue ring that goes around the edge of the trampoline is made of really cheap thin plastic, about  the consistency of of a plastic grocery sack, lined with a thin padding. I don't think the blue ring will last a month. The reason it gets three stars, and not two, is because it is supposed to support an an older child or an adult. We wanted a trampoline that the entire family could use.",3.0
"Purchased this for my 35lb almost 3 year old son to burn off some energy in our tiny apartment when the weather is bad.  One of the legs has fallen off already and does not screw back on (but we can still prop it up).  The frame is not very sturdy and we're constantly having to straighten it out.  It's not very bouncy either as some other reviewers have said.  Having said that, my son still loves jumping on it so I think we have gotten our money's worth.  I probably would not buy it again.",3.0
"love this trampoline, except for the horrible chemical smell! Kept it in the garage for the first few days and some time outsde on the porch but it still stinks. I have to put it away everytime I'm done which is not what I like to do.",3.0
"I have purchased 2 of these, hoping the first was just chance. I have also purchased 5 replacement spring covers. I have a 7 year old and twin 5 year olds. They love it. Problem is  1. There feet get hung up in the spring pad from time to time or it gets stepped on and it rips easily. It's still ok for a bit but then becomes dangerous. You can buy replacements, but they are not always in stock. 2.  The springs will start to break after a good month or two. My 7 year old is very average in size but could bounce all day if you let him. I would caution against buying it for that age group or above. If it weren't for the cheapy spring cover, 5 and under would have a blast.  It came fast and was very easy to assemble.",3.0
"I got this for my children who are 6 and 8. They really love it, but it took a long time to arrive.",3.0
"I liked the size of the trampoline, wasn't too big and fit on my back porch very well, kids love it and still use it.  Only complaint was the outside blue outer covering was not very strong, (plastic, I think) and once it had a small hole in it, that was it.  With three kids using it we finally just took it off completely as it made the trampoline look very ratty and dingy.",3.0
I bought this mini trampoline for my kids as well as myself for a bit of extra and different cardio. One of the brackets around the leg bent and now its very unsafe. Very discouraged.,3.0
After jumping on it for a little while the outer bars are crooked. The legs are not on the ground anymore either,3.0
it only took two of us to get it together. The first time it was warped after we put it together so we took it apart and did it again. On the second try it was fine. Not sure what the issue was. Went together pretty easily....smells something fierce of gasoline which is annoying. It's really just the blue rubber/plastic/foam that goes around the edge that stinks. The entire room where the trampoline is smells of it....hopefully it will be gone in a few more days as it off gasses. Kids don't rebound as high as they did on their kids trampoline but that's okay.,3.0
"First, I am shocked that no one mentioned the horrible smell of the plastic edge liner....three days of letting it it 'out-gas' and it is at least better, but a little dissapointing for a 'fitness' product. Second, the assembly was easy, BUT, you are advised to read the other reviewers feedback. Third, for the price, it's not bad, but the jump mat seems un-even and not as tight and springy as it should be, but over-all, for the price, or for little kids, I would say it was a good enough deal.",3.0
"I was amazed by the reviews warning that this was hard to assemble, especially the top snapping into place. Even the booklet warns you to have several people help. I am a woman rehabbing a recently broken wrist so I have limited use of my right hand. I managed to snap it together all by myself in seconds and it was a cinch. As I was screwing on the legs, I did notice one of the legs was not screwing on, so I looked inside the leg to see why I couldn't engage the threads. Guess what? NO INNER THREADS. Yup. This trampoline had 5 good legs and one useless one. I was not about to take it apart and try to stuff it back in the box, so I called the manufacturer, Bravo Sports. I was on hold with muzak for almost 20 minutes but I finally got through and explained the problem. Because it was ""under warranty"" I asked for a replacement leg. The rep explained there were no extra parts and that she'd ship me a whole new unit! I waited until I received it before writing this review. True to her word, it arrived a week later by Fedex. I opened it and took out a leg and finished assembling my original unit. By the way, all the legs in the new one are good. It looks sturdy and I can't wait to use it. But I felt compelled to write this review so that anyone considering buying one knows they are rolling the dice. The reviews here are either great or poor, and the quality issues obviously vary. When I was on the phone with the rep at Bravo Sports, she asked me to email her a copy of my receipt, and she also asked that I take a photo of the bad leg so they could continue to look at quality issues since this a Chinese import. I'd have given it it a far better review had I not gotten the one bad leg which resulted in added inconvenience. But on the plus side, I now have a box full of spare parts should this need repair.",3.0
"Very difficult to line up poles and slip together. Directions state that it takes 3 people to put this mini trampoline together. This is probably true as my husband and I were able to put it together ourselves only after many heated words were exchanged.
Once assembled, the trampoline rebounded with good tension and could withstand a 125LB person jogging on it just fine.",3.0
"I have had 2 mini tramps in the past with metal springs that broke, so far for the price this seems like a good choice. One warning it is hard to put together.",3.0
I use this as a jogging trampoline. I prefer the trampolines that use springs rather than this one which uses elastic (rubber) type straps to absorb the shock. But I must add the trampolines with the springs do not last very long for me before wearing out. I have not used this one long enough to see if it lasts longer.,3.0
"As previously mentioned, this is NOT easy to put together.  It took 3 adults for us, and the instructions make you think someone is about to die if not done properly, which turns out it could be so.  Also, the blue foam pad is very cheaply made.

Once put together, this has performed well, and seems to be great.  Our kids have been on it nonstop. Just beware - it is not easy to assemble. If you're not into activities that threaten bodily harm, you might consider going to Sears and picking up a pre-assembled trampoline there instead.",3.0
"I bought this for my family hoping all of us, ages 7 to 44, would build core strength in a fun way.

My children tried to meet my 100-minute challenge (in 5-minute increments), and they mostly had fun. But after a few days one kid then the other began to complain of back pain. I coached them through technique issues, and my one son is now doing fine, but that put a damper on things.

My husband took a few tries and declared himself done--his legs hurt. I was dedicated to making it work, but unfortunately the jumping flared my calf issues. I tried different ways of going about it (i.e., a high knee run in place) but alas, same deal.

I think the main issue is that the tension is pretty tight except for the very center--in other words, you can't really position yourself to get in a good zone. I'm guessing a slightly larger diameter would be better, but I don't really know.

Other reviews mention assembly issues: here, 2 adults assembled it with ease.

Summary is we haven't given up on our purchase quite yet, but so far not so good.",3.0
"I was not surprised to find so many reviews in favor of and opposed to this trampoline. As far as I am concerned, the reason is to be found in the manual. You may not find a worse set of assembly instructions. When I first recieved it, I did my best to follow the instructions. I formed 2 semi-circles as I was told to do; I put the 2 semicircles at about a 90 degree angle to each other as the picture suggests, but I found it impossible to connect all four arcs of the circle--there was just too much overlap. I called the company, and presto, someone was finally able to make sense of the assembly for me. DO NOT form a 90 degree angle as the picture suggests. What you will need to do is to fold the semicircles almost to the point of laying one on top of the other. By doing so, the overlap will disappear. Once this happens, the joints are set to lock into place, as the instructions state. It is at this point that you will need 2, maybe 3 people to make sure that the joints slide into place safely and correctly as you are opening up the semicircles like a folded piece of paper.

As far as the quality goes, it is too early to tell, but it appears rather sturdy. 5 stars for what appears to be a reliable trampoline, 1 star for shoddy instructions = 3 stars.",3.0
"We purchased this for our 3-year-old as an outlet for his energy and he loves it.  The bounce is less than a spring trampoline, but that's not a bad thing for something children are using in the house.  As for quality, it's obviously not a top-of-the line product but you get what you pay for.  The materials could be stronger.  I weigh 180 lbs and I think if I used it frequently I would probably wear it out within a couple months.  Also one of the elastic bands on the piece that covers the frame snapped when I put it on.  We're going to contact Bravo to see if they'll send a replacement.  Assembly could be a bit of a challenge if you're not handy but it's totally doable without hurting yourself if you're careful.  The instructions call for 3 adults but I put one side of the frame under an immovable object and that worked just fine.",3.0
"I ordered this trampoline for my 8 year old son who has autism and pica (he eats weird stuff for those who don't understand what pica is).  Within 3 hours, he had peeled off the blue part of the trampoline and was snacking on it.  The base structure is very sound...holding up well to his jumping on it, but the blue part had to go and go quickly.  One plus to this is that the structure that holds the jumping mat to the frame isn't springs, but heavy duty straps...so no pinching even though the safety guard had to be taken off so fast.",3.0
"This trampoline comes unassembled. It takes 3 very strong people to snap the frame into place.
The spring rebound when jumping on it, is quite tight.",3.0
This trampoline was difficult to put together.  I had to hire someone to do this for me who had to have 2 large people stand on one end in order to get bars to slide in to place.  However once it's together it's a nice sturdy trampoline and a very good price.,3.0
"I ordered this because I bought my daughter an Airzone bungee trampoline with an enclosure the model is ""My first Airzone trampoline"" through Walmart.com I couldn't afford 500-$1000.00 for a bungee trampoline from Germany so I saw this one springless and it is not bouncy at all it is very jarring and good for a more athletic bounce I was looking for a more fun, easy bounce or ""soft bounce"" silent rebounder. VERY dangerous to assemble but the instructions are right on and it warns you throughly to please follow the directions to the ""T"". This mini is easy to store and is a good started if you are heavier and once you break it in a little it is STILL stiff athletic syle bouncer not that bouncy, bounce you get with a more exensive brand. This mini trampoline is made in China on the box but Airzone is a USA company? So anyway it's confusing... my mini is powder coated and sturdy and my husband will use it so it won't be a wasted purchase. I will save my money and go for Bellicon bungee rebounder. My order was drop shipped from Target.com delilvered on a Saturday, Fedex free shipping!",3.0
"I just received this product today and I am disappointed. This is exactly the same product that we bought from Academy for $15 less and returned, hoping that amazon will carry a better-quality one.

The assembly was not too bad, just remember to hold one half down tight while lining up the other half and insert it. It took about 10 minutes overall.

I noticed there are some little holes on the net, hopefully they don't become bigger holes once we start using it.",3.0
"I really did hate that it said to get three people to put it together - luckily my husband and I could do it even though I have an injured neck, because every other person I feel comfortable enough to ask to help put it together are either out of town or a 45 minute commute away!
It wasn't easy but we both stood on it and levered it apart with our legs, took a few tries for it to ""stick""
I have not seen anybody else mention this. The box has a sticker that says California Proposition 65 warning. This product may contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm... GREAT! No further information or advice about what parts or chemicals that the problem is with, so I don't know if I need to store it outside, or what. Very unhappy with that.
My mom had a mini trampoline, and it was bouncier than this. I don't really like how it feels but it's ok.
Two of the legs are a bit crooked like other people have noted.
If I had it to do over again I'd probably go to a sports store and spend a bit more on one that was already put together and let me bounce a bit higher.",3.0
This is a cheap mini trampoline.  You get what you pay for.  That being said this is great for older kids.  I got this to exercise on and I have a hard time because when you jump even lightly the legs bonce of the ground slightly. I feel like if you were going to exercise regularly on on a trampoline I would get a better quality one.,3.0
"It's a good trampoline for little kids. Two 4 year old can even jump on it together. It can hold an adult fine, but I noticed after using it VERY lightly for a couple of weeks that one of the legs is no longer straight. It's not bended, but is at a wrong angle to the circular frame. I am quite disappointed by this.",3.0
"This trampoline doesn't cost much (which says a lot for the product quality). I ordered the trampoline as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. She enjoys it although she didnt't have to suffer through the process of putting the trampoline together. Some parts came rusted and appeared to be worn or old. However, the trampoline is holding up well and it is still a pretty good gift. I would buy it if you're looking for a temporary trampoline for not a lot of money.",3.0

"Only had this bike lock for a year and it did go through pretty poor conditions in the winter.  Regardless, before any storms the lock started acting up.  The lock became hard to close for no reason..., the key had to be turned and pushed hard to open the lock at all, the chain started coming out of the covering, etc.  It was good for the time it lasted, but it wasn't really worth it in the end.",3.0
"There are times you pay a low price for a quality product, then pat yourself on the back for a bargain well struck; this sadly is not one of them. This is a cheap padlock that is beginning to malfunction after barely 3 months of usage. If you have money to go for something higher, go for it. This for me is a temporary device, that will be upgraded when I get the money.",3.0
"heavy but light to carry. I bought it for the Bronx, so imagine if I need security, and it gives it",3.0
Well I had it for three weeks and then the lock could not close so now every time I want to lock it I have to put in the key at the lock and then close it. But it does keep my bike safe and the chain is very strong,3.0
"The Mongoose BMX Key Lock with Covered Chain is very strong and durable, but it's quite heavy. So if you're looking for a lightweight bike chain than I don't recommend this product.

"We bought the helment the size smaller than this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter when we bought her first Big girl bike 16"". Anyways, the smaller size wouldn't even fit her head!! I don't think her head is big by any means. So we went and exchanged it for this. This one is just as bad. The pads are cool but, the helments adhesive came off the first time she wore it and the pads will scratch her if she isn't wearing pants and a long sleeve shirt! DONT BUY!",3.0
"I don't know why everyone thought the headlight is so dim.  I think it's pretty good.  So is the rear light, which has four different on/flashing modes.  When my kids use these, they are pretty visible, which is what I want at dusk, even though they are on sidewalks.  We've also used them at night and they are bright.

My only problem with these is the installation.  My son has a 20 inch bike and my daughter has a 12 inch bike.  The front and rear lights don't mount securely because the diameter of the mounts is larger than the diameter of the frames.  I emailed Schwinn to ask for some more rubber inserts (they came with one for each mount) to make them fit and they told me to call up Pacific Cycle.  The lady there told me Pacific Cycle bought up the company that made the lights so they have no replacement parts whatsoever.  So, you will get no help from the company if you need any parts or if this doesn't fit your bike.  I did a workaround by inserting some felt pieces I found around the house but I will have to look for something rubber, because felt has no grip.

Oh, and the circumference of the children's bike frames is 2 3/4"".",3.0
"The headlight is just terrible. You're wasting your money on that aspect. You cannot see the road at all, and it eats lots of batteries. I'm throwing mine away, after trying it for  months.  FAR better is to get a planetbike LED headlight - once you try the 1 watt ""Blaze"" light, you'd throw away your schwinn headlight as I am. BUT - this tail light is REALLY GREAT - especially like the 4 different LED modes, which other lights do not offer, and GREAT visibility fron all angles. A real shame that the tail light is not sold separately. At this price, just not worth the $ for a great tail light alone (you'll throw away the front light).

ADDENDUM 2/22/09
I now have the ""Planet Bike Blinky ""3"" 3-Led Rear Bicycle Light"" as the tail light for everyone in my family - it is probably 10 times brighter than this schwinn tail light, can stay lit solid or blink, and comes with mounts that allow you to put it either on the seat post, or on the seat stay (as I have). Absolutely fantastic tail light - easily visible from 0.3 miles away. I'd definitely recommend that instead of this product.",3.0
"I bought mine from a nearby Wal-Mart and it's worked perfectly so far.  Having never installed one before, I just took my time & had some extra zip ties ready...just in case.  The only tool you'll need is something to trim the ends off the zip ties when you're done.  I like the ""scan"" mode which flips thru max speed, avg. speed, distance, total time, etc.  On the down side, I bought another for my son's bike.  It either had a bad sensor or a broken wire from the sensor to the unit.  It never did work.  I took it back for a refund.  For $10 - what do you expect?  You may get one that works fine - you may not.",3.0
Can not get it to work right. I made sure it is lined up with the magnet but it just is not making contact for all of the function.,3.0
Should have a better way of installing this on the handle bars. Calibration is not easy.,3.0
"I paid $12.99 a year ago for this, and I think I over paid then. Granted in a years time, this has fallen off the bike maybe 5 times, due to me loosening it, to maybe save the battery. The sun has tortured it as well in the 1800 miles I have put on the meter while it's still using the battery it came with. Due to the way I routed the cable, the cable jacket broke in one spot, but the device still reads the sensor fine. The problem is the buttons. I don't even ride in the rain, but the buttons have seen better days. It's very hard to change to the mode you want and even harder to reset the numbers since the button press either seems to go overboard or not at all.

I imagine all of these cheaply made Chinese bike computers will have the same fate, so a fair price for this is $5-6. I can't buy the Schwinn name on the device for that price, but I can get the same exact device at that price shipped. Get something better or try to pay as little as possible for something that will only really last one year or maybe 2000 miles.",3.0
Satisfied.  Packaging could have been better.  I ordered two.  Fortunately they arrived in tact.,3.0
Small to read,3.0
"Works great. My ONLY complaint about it is the stupid clip mount piece of it is very week. So the computer part will disengage and slide out of the mount if its bumped while riding. I was waving away a spider last night and the computer went flying on to the road. It clipped right back in and was fine(I think I may have run over it). This is my only complaint. If it gets too bad I may zip tie it in place or something...but overall, for the money, not bad.",3.0
"When i got the Schwinn it didn't take time at all to set it up on my bike, and personally i think this little computer is perfect for what i need. I had one big problem, it took me forever to align the magnet with the sensor, So word of advice- make sure when the wheel spins, the magnet passes the bottom portion of the sensor, or else the sensor can't see if the magnet is there.
Overall it is a great device for the price, but i just had that one problem.",3.0
To many features and instructions that make it too user unfriendly and complex to remember and use. I suggest simplifying it.,3.0
"The computer functions well as advertised, but it the computer was always falling off of the mounting bracket on the bike handle. It finally bit the dust when it bounced off while being carried on a car roof rack. A little tape would have kept it on safe and sound.",3.0
"If you want to keep it more than a week, wrap a few wraps of electrical tape around it tightly, to prevent the locking tab from disengaging. Make sure nothing jerks on the cords coming out of the computer base. That happened to me, and I'm stingy enough I re-soldered the (shortened) wires, and it still works reliably, but it was a PITA. The magnet has a tab on it that looks like it's made for bladed spokes. It works for that, but it also works to pinch 2 spokes together where they cross, so the magnet does not rotate. If you can angle the sensor forward of the fork blade, close enough to read there, it works reliably in that position and the magnet stays put even better. (small spokes let it rotate sometimes if just put on 1 spoke.)

I have a half dozen of these on different bikes, and found some small Chinese Neodymium magnet discs (look like button batteries) that fit in the magnet holders. Holy cow, the stronger magnets make readout faster and sensor position less critical. $5 worth did several computers' magnets upgrades.",3.0
Head works fine. Good thing I had part of the old speedo on my bike from the last one. Didn't get the magnet that screws onto the spoke!,3.0
"I won't describe the product in detail, discuss instructions, etc. as that has been covered extensively by other reviewers.

PROS: (1) Low price. (2) Has the all basic functions needed by a beginner to intermediate biker to track their progress / measure their improvement.  (3) Reliable and consistent (at first) as long as the cyclometer is properly set up for you bike and is firmly seated into the mount.

CONS: (1) Poor build quality and plastics, especially the mount, which means this cyclometer's measurements will become unreliable in the long run. (2) The mount is only suitable for the handlebar; if you want to attach the cyclometer to the stem, you have to look elsewhere (or make modifications to the mount).

DETAIL: I've purchased 4 of these and/or their Bell twins, both wired and wireless models, and installed them on 4 bikes. After going thru cold winter riding season followed by hot summer rides (e.g, about a year), ALL of them started getting loose in the mount, causing unreliable readings as the cyclometer would lose then regain contact to the mount as the bicycle hit bumps in the road. Identical rides would be measured at 26.7 miles one day, 18.4 miles the next and 21.8 miles the third.  Average speeds would vary by 3-4 mph from day to day, when my watch showed that I was covering a fixed course at in the same amount of time. VERY frustrating.

QUICK FIX: If you choose to buy this cyclometer and eventually start to experience reliability problems, try using a thin rubber band to hold the cyclometer firmly to the mount. After I did that the readings became reliable / consistent again and the cyclometer has yet to fall out of the mount, no matter how hard a bump I've hit.

"This is a fine, easy to install, and use, basic bicycle computer for a nice price.

"I initially bought one of these from Wal-Mart for around $14 to go with the 26"" Schwinn Beach Cruiser I bought; also from Wal-Mart.  I liked the color and it was very easy to program my tire size, time...etc.  Later, when I switched to a 26"" Pacific MTB, I reprogrammed the tire size for that bike with no probs.  The numbers are large which makes it easy to read your speed. When I got my Trek road bike, which has 700x23 tires, I went ahead and got another one for that bike.  The problem is there was no setting on the computer for this tire size so I will need to get a different computer for my Trek, which is too bad because I was satisfied with this little computer for the price, although when I was going down the road one day, someone gave me the speed their computer was reading which was 2mph faster than what my computer said.  I had a spill last year and the computer flew off its bracket, but it survived intact with only a few scratches on the outer housing and then a few months ago it flew off my bike and landed on the pavement.  The glass face received a little spider web crack but it still works.  I discovered it's very important to check that the computer is well seated in the bracket prior to each ride or after a significant bump because it can work loose.",3.0

I have no tremor; neither do I have any problems with steadiness; however, I found it practically impossible to hold the laser crosshairs on the flagstick from 60-100 yards away without getting a multitude of readings, depending upon what reflection it relied upon. I found myself with a multiple choice reading, and even the one closest to my estimate was doubtful.  Even steadying the binoculars on the cart edge didn't really help much.

I'd really love to find something that was quick, easy to use, and reliable.  My short iron and wedge shots are my most reliable means to birdie and par!",3.0
"I have used a Bushnell Yardage Pro400 Laser Rangefinder since June, 1997. This summer it went belly-up, so I purchased the Bushnell Yardage Pro Tour (#200002), a much smaller instrument than the Pro400, which was like a binocular. However, with our new reflector flagsticks, I could read beyond 400 yards by merely pointing toward the green, without actually seeing the flag. It worked great. The Yardage Pro Tour, while small and convenient, is no where near as accurate or sensitive as the Pro400. It's hard to hold steady and must be exactly on the reflector flagstick to get a reading. It has a special feature, which if you depress the button for more than 3 seconds, it starts scanning (It usually takes longer than 3 seconds to get any reading). With a jiggling hand, the instrument flashes various yardage numbers faster than one can read them of whatever the instrument is scanning at that instant. Even with the flagstick laser reflectors, it's very difficult to get a reading. It's almost impossible to read the flag from beyond 150 yards. Certainly, it can't compare with the old Pro400. I sent the Pro400 to Bushnell for a repair, but they have no parts for it. They did offer to sell me a Yardage Pro Trophy (#202018), a lesser model than the Yardage Pro Tour, for $150. I can't honestly recommend the Yardage Pro Tour. If I had it to do over, I'd probably buy the Elite 1500, a larger, more expensive instrument reminiscent of the Pro400.

6/1/07 UPDATE - I returned the Yardage Pro Tour on 3/29/07, requesting a replacement under warranty for a defective product. On 4/26/07, I received a warranty replacement. However, the eyepiece was not adjustable, which rendered it useless for me. I called and got a ""Call Tag"" for returning it  to Bushnell. On 5/29/07, a second replacement arrived with adjustable eyepiece but without the collapsible eyepiece rubber cup (oh, well!). This device works very good, probably as specified. I've used it only two days, but was able to get all the readings that I attempted. I read a laser reflective pin at 417 yds, not that I needed that reading for choice of club, but just to see what it would do. On another golf course, without the reflectors, I could still read the flags from where I got curious. It may be a coincidence, but the gold flag seemed easier to read. I'll have to check this further. All in all, I would say this is an acceptable product probably worth the price. I would give it 4 to 4.5 Stars if I knew how to edit the Star rating. Nevertheless, I would opt for the Pinseeker Elite 1500 if I purchase another.",3.0
"I wanted to order this stove (model 414 Powerhouse) from Amazon but the expected ship time was ""1 to 2 months"" and that was completely unacceptable to me; so I instead purchased it from Sears (same price & free shipping), and I received it within a week! I couldn't have been happier about the condition that it arrived in (appears that some others' arrived dented/dinged). My first impression was that Coleman built this thing as cheaply as they possibly could. Had the penny-pinching executives made the metal any thinner this product would certainly collapse under it's own weight! I wouldn't dare put a heavy pot of beans on this thing for instance. The saying ""they don't make them like they used to"" couldn't be more true with this product (and possibly all Coleman products). I suppose that is just the new standard with virtually any product being manufactured nowadays. Cheapness traits aside, this stove appears to work as intended. I fired it up for the first time with no issues and there were no leaks (almost a surprise really). The fit and finish is so-so... if you look close you'll notice some of the metal edges of the casing are bent, but with the metal panels being almost paper thin it doesn't take much imagination to wonder why. One other thing I'll mention - getting the fuel tank assembly removed from the case for the first time was a major PITA... I believe they had to bend some of the casing metal just to stuff the it in there. I unscrewed the generator and in doing so that assisted with maneuvering it out. Overall I'm glad it works. I would be much happier however if I was able to find a good condition model from many years ago (before the time of penny-pinching executives).",3.0

"Editing my review, going from 1 to 3 stars. 2 off for having to fine tune the fuel and air, and for the fuel tube not seating completely without modification. Adding 2 because once you find a sweet spot in making it work, it works very well. Figured out it was running too rich, causing a yellow flame. I burned a bunch of fuel from the tank, relieved the air pressure by opening the full port and did the 30 pumps and now it works perfectly. Mild hiss and the flame is a tight, controlled blue. Was torn on buying a new stove, and I'm glad I decided to tinker with this one.

Original:

Had an old version from the 90s that caught fire in a forest in Oregon. The fuel tube quit sealing in the generator, causing it to catch fire. The flames reached 3-4' over the stove, licking the thankfully green tree over the table. Pulled the fuel tank out, and the fuel tube was spraying fire, with the fuel valve completely off. It scorched the stove black.

Coleman replaced that old one free of charge. I was stoked!

Build quality didn't change much in 20 years, plus this one was dual fuel. I was extremely happy.

So here I am in Oregon, 700 miles from home, and this brand new replacement stove is doing the same thing! The generator caught fire. The fuel valve was cracked maybe 1/8 of a turn and the flame was huge. Worked great the first night, and now it is causing more trouble than it's worth.

I'm guessing that the seating design is just plain poor. I bent the tabs on the tank to push the fuel tube further into the generator, and it didn't help much.

Works great the first couple times, but it isn't worth the risk of burning yourself or starting an uncontrolled fire. It is Made in USA, but not very well, it seems.",3.0
"Guess I was expecting old-school Coleman quality when I ordered this.  I was quickly disappointed when I opened the lid and one side wouldn't open all the way without working with it for a while.  Then, I found that the windscreen clips were not properly bent.  The grate design made it so that I had to work with it also to get it placed correctly.  Do they not test this stuff themselves?
Once I got it all set up, it worked like a champ, however.  Burners worked very well.
After using it, I tried to drain the fuel tank which is impossible due to the recessed filler port.  I poured out all the fuel I could and then had to run the stove at full power on both burners for about 30-minutes to empty the tank.
Will not buy another new Coleman stove without thoroughly researching it first.",3.0
old school coleman stoves are made stronger but can still catch on fire if not used right ..........or you can spend $295 buck with free shipping like i did and buy a 22inch cook partner  i have coleman gas stove it'd great and i have the  propane cook partner  .I LOVE THIS STOVE BUT ITS FOR OLD FARTS LIKE ME .....I DONT WORK ANYMORE  SO FOR YOU YOUNG PEOPLE IT GOS LIKE THIS----- IM GOING TO GET PAID AND I NO JUST WHAT IM GOING TO DO IM GOING TO SPEND MY MONEY CALLING EVERYBODY HONEY WIND UP SONGING THE BLUES......SVE YOUR MONEY KIDS AND BUY THE BEST THE FRIST TIME.......................................o by the way i have a 1966 single buner that still works and is bullet proof,3.0
"The case was slightly dented, but it works fine.  Not worth the trouble to try and exchange it.",3.0
The lid metal is quite a bit weak. Older ones from years past have been made with a much heavier metal construction. Gas tank is a little loose and has to be pushed in several times whilst cooking to make sure it's securely fitted to the burner. worked pretty well on my last camping trip in the mountains though. Powerful flame on the main right side burner. Left burner is serviceable.,3.0
Left burner is VERY weak!,3.0
probably a good stove but i had to return because i ordered a discounted used one and it was missing parts i will order again,3.0
"I bought this one refurbished, I would buy new if I did it again. It came with some old fuel still in the tank, I drained and added new fuel but it would light, didn't even have fuel coming out of the burner. Stopped by a sporting goods store and he said it was fouled by the wrong fuel, probably cheap gasoline he said. Tried to clean it but could only get a small flame. Returned it to Amazon (thanks, great return policy). Next year I will reorder a new one, I have gallons of white gas for the lanterns so this type of stove makes sense.",3.0
"I had one of these that I bought years ago and used many times. Was still working fine, but lost it in a fire. This one appears to work ok, but the quality just isn't there. Gauge of metal is VERY light. Wind shields were bent when I received it. The little catches for the shields are poorly made, so I threw them away and made some that would actually work. Knowing what I know now, probably would not have bought another.",3.0
Its a little tinny. But it will do the job nicely. Too bad that manufacturers can't make things like they once did.,3.0
"I was a bit disappointed with the new Colman Camp Stove.
First of all before  we ordered it we used my dad's old Coleman stove.
The same one he use when I was a kid back in the late 1960's. It still worked like a charm
Nice blue flame sturdy and reliable.
We decided it might be wise to get a duel fuel stove.  In case of an emergency it would be easier to find
Unleaded gas then camping gas.

When I received it, I was surprised how thin the gauge of metal used to manufacture the stove.
It was not much better than a tin can. The top cover did not sit flat when closed because of the thin warped metal. The side wind wings were very flimsy, not sturdy at all.
OK now for the operation.  Unlike the old Coleman stoves these new ones are really finicky when operating. They flood out very easily.  And when you're camping and it's early in the morning the last thing you want is a capricious stove with a bunch of hungry campers.
So do not fill the tank all the way full. Try to keep it at half a tank. Or ells you will get the dreaded yellow flame and it will take forever for it to change to a nice blue. The air fuel mixture must be correct. Not too much fuel and not too much air( like when your tank gets almost empty).  If you have a constant yellow flame for more than 5 minutes the generator is flooded. You will have to turn it off take out the tank and either wait for about 15 to 20 min for the fuel to evaporate from th generator or turn the stove upside down to empty out the generator.
Make sure you dry up all the fuel that has spilled out on the bottom of the stove before you start again. You don't want a huge stove fire like I had and turn your new green Coleman to a green with black charred camouflage look.  Oh and always keep a small fire extinguisher nearby handy just in case.
Don't worry my stove still works fine even after the bon fire. At least in that way they are still reliable. Incidentally now the stove top sits flat when closed due to the extreme heat of the stove fire. Guess it heated the metal up enough to warp it back the other way  But I would not recommend this method to straighten out any warpage in your  new Coleman camp stove. (-:",3.0
"I bought this product because my friends from Canada brought one with them when they came to Australia 8 years ago. But I'm not sure this new model is as good as the one they had. This one seems to have thinner metal, and is flimsy and not well made.  It still lights and cooks well, but I'm just not sure these new ones are as good as the old ones. I'll have to find someone with an old one and compare. The lid and wind covers bend very easily, and the lid catch isn't quite straight. The tap for the second burner is very loose and feels really cheap and like it's about to fall out. I'm going to install a small axle bearing to make it feel better.  I'm also going to install a clip to hold the tank from rattling when in transport. EVERYTHING rattles when in transport. I now put a small towel inbetween all the pieces to stop the rattling.  The addition of an electronic igniter would make this product a lot better too.",3.0

"I really wanted a pre-seasoned cast iron skillet to replace the series of 'disposable' teflon coated ones that I've been using, but when I recieved this one, I was a bit disappointed for 2 reasons.  As someone else already stated, make sure you coat it well with oil on the first use.  Even though I did, the eggs still stuck.  Which leads to my second problem.  The picture does not show the large gutter on the flat side.  That makes it rather unusable for eggs, pancakes, etc.  I tried it anyway, trying to keep the eggs away from the gutter, but they dripped in, and my fried eggs turned into a stuck-on long drippy mess in the gutter.  I wouldn't even try pancakes on it.  :-(  It would cost more in shipping to return it than it costs (almost!) since it's so heavy, so I'll keep it and use it in the oven and on the grill, but I'm unhappy that that picture does not show that gutter.  I'm going to order the larger griddle, but that one is going back if it has the same gutter!",3.0

It looks like the vintage models from the 1980s. This helmet is fine for wearing to a baseball game, for autographs, or a party. However, the plastic is quite thin and lightweight. I know that it's not suppose to be a real helmet, but I was hoping that there would be more ""heaviness or bulk"" to it.

This replica helmet might be worth recommending at about $13, but $19 is a bit too high for this item.",3.0

"I bought this a couple of years ago for 300 something dollars and was shocked when I saw the price it is now, over 400. When I received it the ups guy was not really happy about bringing it upstairs since I used to live on the second floor. I felt really bad but I couldn't help since I am 5'2"" and had very young children at the time. I put it together myself which was not to bad. I loved how quiet it was to start. But a few weeks later it started to squeek really bad and the screws that were put in constantly loosen.  After about 2 years the handle bars kind of move around but tightening the screws doensn't do anything.

Really I don't use it, my brother does and he doesn't mind it so I guess if you can live with some noise and tightening the screws all the time it wouldn't be bad but I don't think I would find it a great buy at over 400 dollars.",3.0
"This unit seems well built and sturdy, but though the action is very smooth, it hurts my knees.  Because it is compact, which I wanted, the steps are spread apart on either side of the center plastic housing.  This causes you to have to sort of ""jump"" from side to side as you work out.  This apparently places a strain on my already damaged knees.  I have tried out elipticals at sporting goods stores and will replace this one with a longer unit that has the housing behind the steps, so they are close together as you would normally walk.",3.0
"I liked the smaller space saving size.  It worked well for both me and my husband.  But, as usual, it only lasted 3 years before it broke, just like the last one that I bought (different brand).  I guess you get what you pay for when go for the lower priced equipment.",3.0

"Useful to me to check my heart rate at various times during the day.  Have to be still to get a reading, so not useful if walking, biking etc.  But for the price, worth it to me.",3.0
This device is a simple and fairly accurate way to measure your heart rate. I use it to determine my resting heart rate in the morning and at various times throughout the day. It is sensitive to movement and therefore sometimes produces erroneous results. For this reason I would not recommend it to determine your heart rate while exercising. For accuracy I take my heart rate 2 or 3 times. You can't beat the price but I wish it was backlit.,3.0
for the price its not bad. its very  simple to use. that's what I wanted. its also pretty accurite as long as you don't move around too much. It works well for me. If you want something that's inexpensive  and works rather well then this is the one for you.,3.0
"I purchased this monitor because I wanted to check my heart rate while exercising, and it was much cheaper than the kinds with the chest strap and watch.  However, it seems that there are a lot of things that interfere with the monitor reading your pulse.  Specifically, mine will not read accurately if I am moving at all.  It is difficult to check your pulse when exercising if you have to completely stop moving first.  Even when I'm stopped, sometimes I cannot get my finger positioned just right on the pad, and I can see that it is reading my pulse erratically (there is a little heart that flashes.)

If you only want to check your pulse occasionally, and you are a patient person, this might be the right monitor for you.  If you want to monitor your pulse more closely during exercise, you may be happier with the traditional chest strap models.  In the end I wound up buying one of those, and I'm much happier with it.",3.0

battery went dead and to expensive to replace it,3.0
"I just wanted something simple to relieve the monotony of my daily walk. It is not always reliable, even when used as directed. When it does work correctly, though, I like it just fine.",3.0
Is the pedometer is a little difficult to figure out.  There are times when it changes not sure why or how.  I need more time to figure it out just haven't had an opportunity to work with it. I was hoping for something a little easier to use,3.0
When purchased I was doing quite a bit of walking and used the pedometer. Due to health problem cannot walk as much but I should use it daily just to see how I'm doing.,3.0
"I used this pedometer (actually I bought a series of them when each quit or got lost) for years, but then fashion conspired against me-- and it.  The fashionable low-rider pants (which I guess are designed to show off the wearer's belly-button piercing, and I'm only being half-facetious) don't allow the HJ-105 to work at all.  I have done my 60 laps around the track only to discover that the Omron HJ-105 has credited me with less than 2000 steps.  Apparently if it's not positioned JUST RIGHT, it doesn't register steps.  I took to wearing an elastic around my waist and clipping it to that, but that's not very convenient.  So, when I found the Omron HJ 150, I was delighted, because it is sensitive to steps taken even if the pedometer isn't exactly at your waistline.  The other criticism I have of the HJ-105 is that it has entirely too many bells and whistles.  And when you replace the battery, you have to go through measuring your step, plus an elaborate series of click-click-clicks to get it set up again.  I like the HJ 150 better, even though it's big and bulgy.",3.0
"My original pedometer measured all my steps sthroughout the day.  This one only measures a walk for more than 10 minutes continuously.  I did not see this statement in the write up when ordering.  Since I do some teaching, there are times I am constantly on the move, but not necessarily in continuous 10 minutes segments.  Now I will need to purchase another pedometer.",3.0
I thought it was hard to work....I didn't feel like it was accurate. I would rather have a calorie counting watch!,3.0
"It is a good pedometer for the price, but I have to give it a lower rating because it is too easily lost.  My daughter had 2 of them and lost each when it fell off while she was walking.",3.0
".......beats retracing your steps in a car for an odometer reading. If you know what I mean.

Or, maybe not!",3.0
"I keep daily track of my mileage, and so i wear and consult a pedometer.  I've gone through many, and Omron is a worthy brand. I bought this particular unit on price, from Amazon, but only within a necessary parameter, which is that a pedometer must have a lid, for otherwise your clothes invariably push the buttons, and your end-reading is nonsense.  I liked the software of this unit, such as automatically reverting to zero at midnight - but with the data preserved in memory.  The flaw, though, and the reason I've only given a qualified appraisal, is the clip (that holds it on your belt) is insufficient.  This means that the unit falls off, and sooner or later you don't notice, and you've lost it.  This seems a common problem with pedometers, and I'm not sure what's the solution - a pedometer watch perhaps?  In any event, this probable fate for pedometers encourages economy in purchase. as you do go through them because of this.  Otherwise this unit seems fine - I'm not fussy about accuracy, though features like calories or steps are useless to me.  And again, Amazon - as always - stands behind them.  I got a dud once, and Amazon instantly replaced it without a quibble.  Really, I'd step up to a top-end pedometer, but I always lose them - I know there are such palliatives as lanyards and such, but even for me that's too fussy.  So, this is a good piece, but it needs a better attachment device - the little spring-clip doesn't do it.  And the price is right!",3.0
"I just got this product, and I set it up per the instructions. I bought it because it is advertised as being able to count calories burned, but the user manual does not indicate how or where the calorie information is displayed. I am not certain I will see that information at all.",3.0
"I have bought 4 of these pedometers. One for myself and the others for various family members. I had the ones for family members sent straight to them. Mine and the first gift was received in the stated amount of days, and I was notified when my gift was sent.

The other two I ordered on the same day, and sent one to 2 different addresses.  I never received an email stating that they had been delivered.

I sent an email for each of the 2 pedometers ordered and asked if they had been delivered yet.  I received the same tracking number for both orders.  I then replied to them and explained that I needed the tracking number for the second order. They sent me the same tracking number back.

I sent another email. I'm waiting to see if they read the email this time and I get the correct tracking number.

Not a good experience!",3.0
"This was one of my first pedometers when I started walking and like everyone else, found it easy to use.  I recently found it, bought batteries for it, and it's great, but I realized that it has no 'timer' on it.  It has a clock, but it doesn't tell you how long you have been walking.  I ordered another one while my first one was lost, but will probably be sending it back to purchase one that has the actual timer, not just a clock.  Otherwise, it's great for people that are more interested in steps and not so much time because once set up right, it's very accurate.",3.0
"For just counting steps while walking, this is a decent product. However, it is not totally accurate if you go running. Also, car rides can sometimes increase your step count is the road is a bit too bumpy.
The setting for measuring distance is not accurate at all, but I don't really mind.
The belt clip is sturdy. I haven't had any problems with it breaking or the pedometer falling off.
Also, this pedometer is definitely purple. I'm not sure why they labeled it as ""blue"" when it is without a doubt purple.",3.0
I bought this one because it had really good reviews.  It was easy to program with the exception of setting the stride and so I think that is why I am off about 150 steps per mile:(,3.0
"This was the first pedometer I have ever used, so I didn't have a lot of background on what a good pedometer should be.  It calculates # of steps, # of aerobic steps, distance traveled, and calories burned.  It took me a little while to get it set up to correctly calculate the number of steps I took, but once I achieved that, everything else about its operation was simple.  Although it's rather plain looking (and a little on the cheap side), it's accurate and easy to use.  I'd recommend it to anyone on a budget who is trying to measure these statistics.

The included battery didn't last very long.  When I went to purchase another I found that the price of the battery was almost as much as the product.",3.0
I bought this because I've registered for summer course so I was thinking of getting some exercise by walking. So I bought this and I wear it whenever I stand up and walk but I find that this is not as accurate and is said. Cause sometimes when my steps are lighter they won't feel that movement so it won't count that step. And sometimes when I walk to fast and the movement's too big it will count as 2 instead of 1. I still can't say that this is a bad product but just not what I've expected.,3.0
"I bought this  after I gave birth to my son, so I could start the slow process of getting back into shape.  It's actually not bad--my only complaint is that it is really sensitive and counts steps sometimes when you're standing still or sitting.  But I've heard that many more expensive ones also count steps that you don't take.  But to resolve this, I just take it off when not in use.",3.0
"Well, when I first got it I thought I could just run to the gym once the battery was activated. Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my strides and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you. I also like the time feature but you can/t use it if the case must be closed while walking. Overall a little complicated if you just want something to count steps or miles IMO. I did want something a little simpler for life.",3.0
"Sometimes shows wrong number of steps walked.

"I purchased this because of the Omron name. It is compact, easy to attach and works well... once you understand how to set it. It took several tries,& much fustration before I was able to set it and have it work properly. If you can get thru all that its an OK product",3.0
I really liked this Pedometer and wore it everyday till the battery ran out.  Then I could not find a replacement anywhere.  I tried the web site and they did not offer any help. Will keep looking because I really liked this pedometer.  Easy to set and use.,3.0
"I was really excited about it, but it fell off my belt the first time I used it. Took a long walk, went to see how many steps I'd taken, but it was gone. It worked well while I had it and it was extremely easy to set up. I might get another one and try it clipped inside a pocket or I might try another brand that has a leash, wrist band, etc.",3.0
"I bought two of these so that my husband and I could both track our steps thru the day. It has a nice large display that is protected by a cover. The buttons are easy to use and there are only three of them. Usage is fairly intuitive and setup is not too complicated.

The only problems we have had are: 1. This unit is very sensitive to any motion. Each time the cover is opened or the unit is bumped, steps are registered. 2. I never could get a good reading on my unit, even after tweaking the controls over the course of several days. I finally settled for letting to unit register 3-5 steps more per hundred and doing a +/- calculation to get a fair approximate of my steps per day. 3. This unit is also very sensitive to placement. If you don't have it level or if it is too close to the side or center or the body mid-line it will not give an accurate reading.

For a first pedometer I don't feel to bad about this model. It was inexpensive (under $10.00) so I haven't invested too much in it. (Un)fortunately my husband has already lost his pedometer and we have replaced it with the Omron HJ-112. If this one works out I will probably replace mine too.",3.0

Product Description

Amazon.com Product Description

The V700's patented magnetic-sensor technology is the same advanced technology used by GM, Ford, and Chrysler in their built-in compasses. A magnetic-distortion flag alerts you when outside interference is affecting accuracy, and the unit's smart auto shut-off feature conserves battery life by automatically powering down the compass when your vehicle is parked for ten minutes or more.

___________________________________________________________________________

This I highly dought about using the same technology -

For one - using it with auto adaptor - leaving it plugged in - and You previously set it up prior the day before - Start the vehicle - and the compass goes retarded pointing more than the opposite way.

I received it Feb / 05 - I almost returned it a week later - from constantly having to find a full circle space to rotate vehicle to reset it everyday - But I hung in there trying to figure out this problem - as a retired aircraft service tech - you tend to get fussy how things work from day one

 With the unit mounted on center of windshield - with vehicle off - and unit on - I try testing compass for interference - as quoted in top paragraph about a distortion flag - there has never been a flag -

Unit on - vehicle off - I turn the key to on position - already the unit flips out of it's set coordinates - turn key off - unit returns to setting - Apparently - magnetic impulse of vehicle system energizing is enough to throw it off - I'm not starting the veh - just turning key to power up the dash - as starting sequence would be much more of a pulse. Turning on the turn signal - brake lights - etc - could also create a pulsed magnetic field.

Remove unit from center of windshield - There may be a better spot that's more shielded.

In the end - I found the ideal spot mounted on the windshield next to driver's door pillar - So far I have not had to reset it more than twice - and it's a nicer spot for viewing as well.

In order to make this position possible - I went to local Best Buy to get an adaptor that has small profile plug to cig lighter where cord comes out at right angle keeping cords close to console - the other end has 4 ports and was easy to place on lower face of dash next to drivers door to make vertical approach straight up to the compass and anything else up there.

It's the sticky Velcro deal - and may have to update to be more permanent.

Also the cell phone has a new port now - VS the clutter in center of dash.

For general use - I find it handy when out at night and knowing I'm going the right way after making unknown exits from the freeway - or just knowing I'm on the south side of the Mall at night.

In no way is it as accurate as the GPS - Which I also use.

Checking compared positions can be up to 20 - 30 degrees off and can be effected by any interference The balloon of magnetic fields coming from Your vehicle could be isolated to a point but would involve thin sheet film of metal embedded into a dash pad.

If you want to know just how its performing - get a handy pocket compass - stand ten feet away from vehicle and compare position to the unit in vehicle. Do not park or set up compass near power lines.

Making sure it's latched into it's holder is a must - The edges of mount have to be forced into groove of compass - this took me a couple days to notice - when it kept falling out.

I purchased 2 of them - One as a Gift to an older gal in a wheel chair - and I wanted to be very informed as to what problems she may see before I ship it 2000 miles to her door.

This toy can give you a workout chasing it around. It flies so far you will spend most of your time going out and getting it. It is fragile in the wind and will be carried away by it. Not the best on the beach. Takes some practice getting the right throw. Tends to get a little wild. Also beware of trees.

"First, let me own up, I have the other Field knife, not this one. But I have some useful comments about this knife which may help you decide about it.
Next notice that while both ""Field"" knives are from SOG this one is made from a different steel AUS8 than the larger one which is made from BG-42 a more exotic and harder steel. BG-42 is considered by collectors a more ""cool"" and better steel but I understand its much more expensive and difficult to work with. If you search around you'll find a lot of knives made with AUS8 so it must work reasonably well.
To get a good look at the blade shape, its not quite the same as the bigger Field knife, you'll have to go to the Sog Knives Home page at [...]  IMO this knife has a better cutting surface as the sharp part extends almost all the way to the handle while the X-42 knife stops about an inch from the handle. What this means is that you could peel something with it by pulling the blade toward you. Now the blade is a bit wide for this task but it will be easier than the long reach required to make it work for the X-42.
Both knives have a sort of swoop up in the center of the straight part of the blade. This makes it hard to chop the way a a good French Chef's knife works. But with the nice curve on the tip it makes a much better skinning and meat slicing blade. And after all this is a ""camping/hunting/fishing"" knife.
For fishing both knives are way too wide to filet fish. But they have nice grippy handles so cutting heads & tails and gutting would be fine. No losing control of the knife with slippery hands.
The bad is that again this is another awful sheath from SOG. From the photo you'd think it was at least adequate, but in fact there are two major faults. The first is that the belt loop is made from Kytex which won't flex. So any odd shaped belt and you can't deform it enough to get it to pass through. So forget wearing it with that old western belt with the metal tab on the end. The second is that the inside of the sheath is lined with plastic that is not bonded to the leather. This means every time you put the knife back you either have to pinch the sheath or it will catch the lip of the plastic and start to roll it toward the center.
Now I would have most likely tried to cut the plastic out, but its attached all the way down along the back side and I don't have long tool with a bit on it. If you are a surgeon you probably have a used one from doing orthoscopic surgery that would work fine. The rest of us will be better off making our own sheath. There are a number of nice and fairly easy to make ones. Just do an internet search. I like the one on ""Cliff Jacobson's'"" page. Or go to your local leather store. They should be able to help you out.
So all in all, not a bad knife and the price is very reasonable for a quality sheath knife.
Update: Using the knife I was able to cut out the stupid plastic sheath. Took about 15 minutes of fussing to get all of it. Second I made a much nicer sheath following Cliff's instructions, took about 2 hrs. Well worth the time spent.",3.0

"This was my combat knife when was in Iraq, I used it to cut metal straps, wood, sand bags, heavy duty straps, and oil cans. The blade is highly durable, but the serrated part is hard to re-sharpen. The handle didn't go well with combat gloves, and the lanyard hole is too small to fit a chord. Get one with a hard case sheath because you can modify it to fit horizontally accross your belt, without other gear interference. The sheath also comes with an open slot for cutting chord with out taking the blade out.",3.0
"I bought the Sealpup for use as a dive knife, and after a year of use have this to say about the knife.

-The original sheath isn't the most comfortable in use. Doesn't seem to fit the knife that well.

-The phosphate finish on the blade isn't as corrosion resistant as I had expected. Not much better than a typical stainless steel blade. However, the blade keeps it's edge extemely well.

-The handle doesn't grip as well as other knives when wet.

Overall, I'm not sure it's performance justifies the relatively high price this knife costs.",3.0
"Its an ok lightweight knife, cheap sheath snap ripped off a month after purchase so now I have to worry about it falling out whenever I wear it.  Plastic handle is not one I'd recommend striking to its of limited use as a hunting/camping/survival knife, but it'd be fine for a younger person who likely won't count on it but more likely use it for lighter tasks.  Other than the sheath, I can't complain about this product, just buy it for what it is.  Its a pup, its not a big dog.",3.0
"Knife is excellent, sheath is a piece of crap.  Expected better from SOG.  Purchased kylex sheath, now its perfect",3.0
"UPDATE: After 16 months I downgraded this review from five to three stars because the sheath it comes with is just plain awful. The retention snap is difficult to open or close The molle strap is thin, flimsy and loose and overall the sheath is bulky. SOG offers the KYD-M40 Kydex sheath that comes with the SEAL Pup Elite separately for about $22 to $30 when you can find it in stock. With the better sheath this combination is only a few dollars cheaper than the SEAL Pup Elite. The even better Gerber Strongarm, which also comes with a great Kydex sheath, is an even better knife and bargain.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: Amazon practically gave me this knife, the price was so low, but I'd gladly pay full retail. It's that good.",3.0

"I have an original Seki Japan version and a Taiwan version. I was going to buy an additional one, especially for the great price, but I saw that some photos show ""China"" markings on the blade. I was suspicious that they were knock offs, so I researched the knife on the SOG homepage.  Apparently SOG has sold their souls a little more and moved production of this model from Taiwan to China. I'm glad that I was wrong and that Amazon is offering authentic products at a great price, but I am very disappointed in SOG for lowering their standards on those authentic products.  I am going to search for and spend my money on another product on Amazon since I make it a point to buy quality US made knives whenever possible.",3.0
"Love SOG knives but was disappointed with this one 

Received my Seal Pup last night excited to have it to go along with my Seal Pup Elite but within minutes decided I needed to return it.
Reasons why...
- Plastic snap on sheith broke on first opening (see last pics). My old Elite has metal snaps, never had an issue.
- Serrated edge too long, goes almost all the way up to the curve so there's very little straight edge to use before curve.
- Not a big reason but disappointed that edge wasn't sharp.

Enjoy the comparison pics next to my Elite and Gerber Stong Arm. FYI, for the $, the Gerber Strong Arm is my favorite...",3.0
"For the price, this is still a great survival knife-hence the 3 stars. You'd be hard pressed to find a seal pup anywhere for cheaper. That being said, what is shown in the product images is not the same product as you will get! This knife is not made in Seki, Japan anymore, nor Taiwan (as shown in the photos), but these are Chinese made. The quality seems about as good out of the box as my other one that is made in Taiwan. Sharp but could be sharpened for a razors edge. My biggest issue is the SHEATH. I don't know who changed the design but I am NOT IMPRESSED!!! What you will get is not the same SHEATH as in the photos. First, the snaps are no longer metal, they are plastic. And that might be okay if it didn't take two hands to open and close the snaps. So if you can't get the knife out of the SHEATH with only one hand, I call that useless! They are extremely difficult to resnap. After opening and closing them a few times I started noticing the nylon under the snap starting to fray. Also the sheaths pocket flap is slightly smaller on the Chinese version, meaning your favorite multitool might not fit now. The new sheath is also about 1/4 inch wider than the old one. Spend the extra $5 - $6 elsewhere if you want one with a sheath that you can rely on.",3.0
"Ok Just got the knife (a day early! Thank you Amazon) 1st I like the knife overall. Size is good, weight is good. I like the design. 2 things. I didn't realize that this knife was made in china I thought they were made in Japan. Guess the price should have been a clue rite. The other thing is that its DULL. Going to take some work to get a good edge on it. My main complaint is the cheap sheath. As far as cheap sheaths go I guess it's OK except the the strap with the snap on it is to short. It won't snap around the handle. So no way to secure it in the sheath. Also the snap itself is plastic. Overall you get what you pay for. I thought I was getting a great deal but got exactly what I actually paid for it. So no complaints on that point. I plan to update this review after I'v had a chance to put the knife to work so we shall what that will show.",3.0
"This is a great and versatile knife. I now have both the taiwan and Chinese version, the Chinese version is the 1 I received from here, the other I purchased at a gun show. At the show I paid 45 bucks out the door, here I got it for less than 30 bucks.
The difference between the 2 seems to me to be the sheath. The blades seem identical except for the stamp on the blade, either taiwan or china. This Chinese version has a slightly thicker and wider (fractions of an inch difference) sheath and the black retention snap is horrible, just awful. So much so that it's nearly unservicable, very difficult to snap closed. The taiwan version has a generic metal snap that actually works, there's the difference. Minus 2 stars for the horrible Chinese sheath, if I were reviewing the taiwan version, which is not the 1 you'll get here, it would be closer to 5 stars. Still a very decent blade for the money but this Chinese sheath is terrible and needs modding to become useful, I may just attempt to remove the button snaps. Barring that, I'll agree with many reviewers here that the sheath is complete junk. At 28 bucks and change though, still a pretty good deal I'd say...",3.0
"With all due respect to our former/active soldier who heaped praise on this knife I hope that the model he carried was different from this undersized, small handled knife I received.
 I have large hands but not huge paws. I found the grip to be short. The knife I received isn't .19 thick either. I was afraid to test the blade because once in my hand I knew it was going back ( Thanks Amazon). Finally, the snap retention wouldn't ""snap"".

That said the knife came with a decent edge and for a smaller handed person the knife might feel more useful.",3.0
Made in China but still a very good blade,3.0
Met expectations. Good knife. Sheath is bulky,3.0
"Knife is as described. It did come considerably less sharp than I had hoped from SOG.  I had to finish putting the edge on it.  The edge was uneven and rather dull.  I have not had a chance to put it to the test, so after we go camping, i'll update.",3.0
Definitely not what it use to be. Not sharp. handle feels like plastic. I have an older SOG which still keeps an edge. Firm grip handle.,3.0
Handle is small and hard so I am going to return it.  Not easy to get a secure grip on this as the very hard handle combined with the small grip size makes for a bad feel in my medium/large hands.  YMMV.  The blade looks good but I would definitely recommend holding one before buying if you get the chance.  I have quite a few knives and prefer either a larger grip or a tackier grip and this would have been okay if it was softer.,3.0
"Well as it's a SOG you know that you're getting a great product. The problem is, try telling that to the rest of the world. It would seem that most of SOG's fixed blades are no longer made in Japan or the U.S.
Now I don't know what financial purpose it would serve the company to inflate a market for products that have already been sold, ie, quit making the blades in Japan to inflate the collector's market value. It's not like SOG gets paid again for the same knife being sold.
Maybe to enhance their mystique, and then say SUPRISE, the blade you just boght was made in Taiwan! ???
The fact is that with Jap/U.S. have moved away from the manufacture of high end commercial grade metals. Only in rare circumstances such as 50,000 samurai blades or LightSpeed bicycle company USA, do we see it.
It just puts a damper on the resale market value of a very good product. Which doesn't do anyone any good.",3.0
"I was very impressed with this knife for three camping trips, until, the next morning of the third camping trip the knife snapped in half as I was just about to baton some SMALL pieces of dry wood to start a fire for coffee and breakfast.  I loved the size of the knife and the edge retention was tremendously good, but obviously the steel (or thickness of) was not meant to do simple campsite chores.  SO, all I am saying is this is not the knife for you if you are looking for a good strong steel that will baton pieces of wood to start a fire and turn around and also cut perricord or 'whittle' some stakes/feather sticks.  I was not prying with this knife or any such abuse, just batoning campfire wood, but according to SOG's limited lifetime warranty, just something as simple as batoning wood is considered 'abuse', so in other words they are saying their STEEL does not stand up to WOOD.  So, if you are looking for a knife to hang on your hip and look cool (""stab someone"" and/or cut rope) this is a great knife.  If you're looking for a fixed blade full tang camp knife that can handle simple ""bushcraft"" chores then this is not your knife, I can't comment on any other knife to direct you to a better knife, because I am still looking (just ordered a BK-7, hopeing the thicker spine and 1095 steel will do me better than the aus-8 steel of the sog (plus the sog pup was smaller than the bk-7).",3.0
"I have to admit, I'm disappointed with this knife. The sheath is great, as is the blade. The handle feels rough however, and it's squared edges and finger grooves are wrong for my hands. Just doesn't seem comfortable at all. I can't imagine using it for anything more than moments to cut anything.
I plan to try to trade it away as soon as convenient. Wish I had gotten something else honestly. That said, most people seem to love it, and it's light, fast in the hand, and looks good. Likely very durable too, as others have said. Good for the right person, just not for me.",3.0
So I had a seal pup already but really wanted the sheath on this one. They are totally different. It doesn't feel like the blade doesn't go all the way down the handle and the grip is smaller than on my older seal pup. Just different and doesn't seem as well made. Still a good knife but quality seems to have gone down over the years.,3.0
Nice color but the hand grip is too thin.,3.0
"I've wanted a SOG Seal Pup for awhile.  Finally bought the elite model and was surprised to see that it's made in Taiwan.  After all the hype about the testing the knife went through for the Seals, it's not even made in the USA!  That information should have been been made available to the purchaser before they decided to buy the knife.  I'm all about buying  ""Made in USA.""  Second thing is, and I've read about this problem before, the nylon sheath is poorly constructed.  The nylon webbing in back of the knive ripped from it's seam immediately after trying to free the strap from the webbing.  As for the knife, it fits my hand perfectly, is sharp, and has great balance.  Haven't used it yet, because I may return it.  Rather buy a Buck, Gerber, Case or Kershaw, something made in America.",3.0
"Nice knife, well balanced and super sharp. The sheath is very well constructed and offers a variety of mounting options. However I was disappointed that it dose not say ""made in the USA"" on it especially when SOG says they supply knives to special forces",3.0
At 40 bucks this is a good knife I sure would not pay full price for this though.  I am a little disappointed in the handle working and sweating or working in a damp area and this handle gets a bit slick not a good thing.  I have given it some abuse and it has held up well it will chip and nick but a little elbow grease gets the blade sharp again.  Of note my go to knife is the similarly priced KA-BAR.,3.0
"From my experience with this knife I wouldn't want it for civilian survival/outdoor use. I received the newer version with the thankfully shorter finger choil and steel upgrade (AUS-8 instead of AUS-6). While I don't mind AUS-8 at this price point I will say I don't like it in this knife. The first time I used it the blade chipped in multiple places just from hacking off light kindling. Therefore, I would never ""hard use"" this knife. The clip point blade is ideal for thrusting soft materials but the very tip of mine has already broken off somehow which I am going to blame on the steel and thin tip thickness because I really haven't abused this knife. Maybe it was a bad batch of steel or maybe it was poor treatment of it by SOG. The serrations are decent for cutting rope and chord and there is enough belly that there is still a lot of plain edge to work with. The finish also comes of pretty easily which is bad because this steel rusts if not cared for (ie. used in a survival scenario). The handle is well textured on the sides and shaped for medium to large sized hands. The recess for your thumb on the spine is awkward because of the flared guard and really needs to be jimped to work well in my opinion. The steel also looses its edge pretty quickly so I wouldn't use it for hunting and skinning but it is easy to sharpen. I got the nylon sheath and it is not of the highest quality on terms of stitching and I would recommend getting the Kydex version.",3.0
"I got it at wally for $40.00 so the price was ok (discounted). I like the blade design, it was sharp out of the package, but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok don't have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small, if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle, it is still a very good knife from a known brand. I will recommend it if the price is $40 or less and for  someone with smaller hands.

"I got a pair of moonshoes when i was about 7. Now i am 17.  They were a lot of fun, but i gor kinda bored.  I really liked them though.  The best thing about them would definately be the rubber bands.  I still have them 10 years later. I use them for all sorts of things. I made water bottle holders out of them by tieing one in a knot and attaching it to my belt.  I want to find more of the rubber bands. 10 years old, and they didn't dry out or anything.

 I remember that they used them on that nickeloden show, ""Wild and Crazy Kids."" they would show the same reruns for years.  I saw that and i wanted them. i got them, didn't use them much (i get bored quicker than most kids)  (i wasn't very active either).

Now i am looking for one somewhere in my house for a water bottle holder for skiing tomorrow.

I would recommend these for a kid who likes to jump around, an alternative from the bed.

I'm surprised that they still sell them. i haven't even seen them in years.

i just started searching for them because i want to find more of the rubberband. I didn't really jump that high, then again, i'm not that good at sports, and it was between a period of 5 and 10 years ago.  Every few years i would see them. 2 years ago i took them apart and used the foot thingys for a sled i made.  they last forever.  i think i just saw part of one in my garage.

They don't really make you jump high, but they make jumping more fun.  it is a good excercise too.

On the bottom I drilled two 3/8"" holes half way through and hammered the rebar (3/8"" x 1') into them.  After digging a out a place to anchor and bury the wood, I drilled an 11/16"" hole in which to place the stake.

does what it says hold water but needs a air release valve so the water flows faster,3.0
"kinda handy to have in emergency, haven't used it yet..",3.0
The water trickles out because theres not a vent hole. I wouldn't buy these again,3.0
"Spout pours very slowly, almost a trickle.  But, the two handles make it great for carrying when full.",3.0
"We used it once this past weekend. It was great because it can collapse and take up less space when packing. Id give it 5stars but it kept leaking. Because the jug is flexible plastic, so is the threading for the spout and the spout is hard plastic and its hard to keep it screwed on tightly without it leaking",3.0
"I'm going to have to drill out the inside of the spigot. The flow rate is so low that even when the container is full, water only dribbles out.

Not what I come to expect from the Coleman brand.",3.0
"What I love about this water jug is that it's collapsable and therefore easy to fit into my luggage when I headed out to do field work. However, what dissapointed me was that it dispenses very, very slowly. We would leave it open with a bucket under it while we prepped the rest of our meals as it was just that time consuming waiting for water.",3.0
very pleased,3.0
"We got this to store water during water rationing in Puerto Rico. Initially, the water carrier worked fine but after awhile it started leaking. I'm not sure what caused the leaking exactly. Either way it worked pretty well for awhile.",3.0
Really hard to store back in the box. Quality is decent for what it is.,3.0
"It did it's job during the recent flooding event in SC. However, it tends to flop over and off the counter since it isn't very rigid. Also, if you have a cat with claws, you can kiss it goodbye. Our cat turned ours into a shower head.",3.0
"Bought this item to take on a camping trip.  Filled with water the day we headed out on a 3 hour car ride.  Make sure to store upright or it will leak.  Easy to fall over if not put up correctly, which can then lead to more leaks or even tears.  Material is not as thick as I wanted, but is true to holding 5 gallons.",3.0
Spigot leaks constantly,3.0
This performed pretty much as expected. It does leak around the cap but can be easily set to where it does not leak when not in use. The spigot is pretty much pointless because so very little water comes out when using it. We just took the entire cap off when we needed waters. For the price it is the perfect water jug to take camping.,3.0
bought it but didn't use it. maybe next time,3.0
will work in a pinch,3.0
"Water carrier leaks a little when positioned upright (as shown in stock photo), so we just stored it with the nozzle facing up, until it was time to get some water, then we just tipped it.  HOWEVER... the water stream in the valve is extremely weak/slow. So, every time I used it, I unscrewed the nozzle.  Good for the price, though.",3.0
"It's a bit flimsy, and when you're talking about something filled with 5 gallons of water, I'd just expect a little more substance to the product.  Overall, gets the job done.

WORD OF WARNING: the threads that the spigot/valve screw on to are less than secure.  On more than one occasion the water tank has fallen only a few inches to the ground, and I've been left with several gallons of water erupting out.",3.0
Water flow is very slow. Otherwise functional.,3.0
Great collapsible water container. The Valve had a small problem. When the valve was fully open the water just trickled out. A small piece of plastic needed to be removed from the valve opening. Then drilled out the opening on the valve body and handle and now it works great.,3.0
"I have a love-hate relationship with soft water carriers. I love how they can be packed and stored in tight spaces, but hate how they ALL leak if positioned with the spout down (as in the picture). Also, this one is slooooow even if all the way open. Filling up a pot is a true test of patience. It's like they need another valve to open on the back or something.",3.0
Spouts leave something to be desired with low flow rate. Cap leaks ever so slightly.,3.0
This product is much lighter weight than one I had previously.  Using the standard water spigots in campgrounds we have never been able to load it more than half full because of the flimsiness of the plastic...the container changes shape with the weight of the water and you just end up getting drenched.,3.0
"This needs a vent plug to make the water flow out of the spigot faster. Plus when you turn the spigot to open it for water flow, the hole is not the same size as the spigot tube. I took a small sharp knife though and opened the hole up a lot and now a lot more flows out when I open the spigot. And make sure you screw the top on tight by screwing it counter-clockwise a couple of turns to seat it right and then screwing it clockwise to tighten it up; otherwise it'll probably leak around the cap or spigot. And wash it out first with a little bleach and water, so that you don't have plastic tasting water.",3.0
Water flows out very slowly...not like our old Coleman which when in open position water ran out in a nice strong stream..,3.0
"Ordered 2 of these for Labor Day camping trip. One was fine but the other has a slow leak around the valve. I told Amazon about it but they wanted it returned at my cost, which was ridiculous--so I kept it for additional storage, put it where it didn't matter, and am merely an unhappy customer. The jug which operated properly does so at a slow trickle, which is annoying when you're filling a heavy container. All in all not impressed but cheap and a lot better than being low on water.",3.0
I works for easy use....but the pressure of the water is really not powerful,3.0
"OK for storing water for portable use. Slow dispensing (very weak flow) and collapsing of the container as it empties are displeasing, but it fulfills its purpose; store water!",3.0
water trickles very slowly and I didn't realize this was a soft collapsible plastic container so its not as sturdy as I would like.,3.0
Ummm,3.0
Cheaper looking than I expected- haven't used yet so I can't comment on durability,3.0
Very slow pour spot even when all the way open. Takes forever to fill a water bottle or washtub so we typically screw off the cap,3.0
"The plastic is stiff and the valve, opened full, trickles out water. It does fold up nicely and I carried it full of water without worrying about the plastic giving under the load. I'm going to get up in the valve with a knife and see if I can't get the hole open a bit wider to turn this into a 4 star product.",3.0
"Works alright, does not seem built to last however.  We used this to hold water for washing hands and dishes.  It works alright but since it has no vent hole the jug just collapses onto itself as you empty it which makes the flow very slow after a bit.  The plastic of this jug already has white stress lines in it from collapsing onto itself a few times.  So far it hasn't leaked but when it does start to leak my gut tells me it is going to fail catastrophically.",3.0
They keep your beverage cold for over 8 hours. The only problem is that condensation can leak through the bottom of the sleeve or drop out the top when you take a drink.,3.0
Its collapsible... Did not read that in description.  I would not have bought if I had known.,3.0
"Poor quality of construction guarantees leaks when you don't want that to happen. Bring some tape with you for hail-Mary field repairs. You can be as careful and gentle with these as you like, or not: it won't make a difference.",3.0
"This is fine for holding water, but as far as being able to use it as I thought, not quite.  The spout leaks, so we do not place the carrier as the picture shows.  We make sure the spout is up, so nothing can leak.  It was cheap and cheerful, and we were glad for that.",3.0
"I filled the jug, and accidentally dropped it, the cap popped off.  Otherwise , it works for my intended purpose.",3.0
This did not turn out to be as great as I thought it would.  If room is very limited I would suggest it.  Room was not as big of an issue for us as we thought it might be.  It does fold nicely and does hold 5 gal. of water.  We use it as a spare.,3.0
"This was purchased (not on Amazon) for a 9 year old girl and 12 year old boy for use with a trick scooter. It is huge. They are beginners and this is really for a more experienced rider but I am hoping they will eventually be able to use it easily. I misunderstood and thought there were three separate pieces that were able to be used separately or together (which would be good for the two of them to move by themselves). While you could use one of the end ramps separately, bolting it together is no easy task because of bolt placement so it will stay as one unit. The first time my husband and I put it together it took both of us to balance it to put bolts in and when we moved the finished product we immediately heard plastic crack but couldn't find the source of the sound. The center section has a plastic frame that is actually two pieces (a table top piece and a frame under it that nests in the table top). The problem is that it easily comes out of its nesting place and if they don't realize it has happened the kids are basically putting weight on a piece of plastic attached by bolts but not supported properly underneath. Since it is so big, it is hard to store/move. I am not sure where we will keep it in winter since our garage is pretty full. The reason for three stars is that my son really likes it and doesn't want to return it. I wish there was more thought put into the design for home use. I also wish the plastic felt sturdier. My kids have worked out a way of carrying it together that seems to be working so we will be keeping it. I am on the fence about whether or not I would recommend it but my son is enthusiastic about it.",3.0
It works but after about 2 months of use it broke,3.0
"Like most EPs this CD has a couple of stand out tracks with some filler.  I'm not saying this is a bad CD but the value for the price isn't so good, it's expensive and I only thoroughly enjoyed two tracks ""Into The Light"", and ""Vicarage Road"".  Even there Amazon allows you to download the first track as an MP3.  I suggest downloading it and counting yourself lucky.
The Cause & Effect sound has progressed but I'd suggest seeing if you can borrow this from a friend or check it out from the library before buying.  I would have preferred to spend the money I used here on something else.",3.0
"handle broke not long after using, wouldn't buy again.",3.0
Awesome for the price not the best quality though.,3.0
The lock/release mechanism is very poorly designed and doesn't work well. Maybe I got a lemon?,3.0
"My daughter just got this for Christmas and it has been too snowy and cold to ride outside yet. However, within 5 minutes of her opening it, one of the streamers completely fell apart. I bought this one because I knew my girlie girl would like the extra details, but it was disappointing that it was made so poorly.",3.0
Cute. The latch to fold the scooter worked 3x before it got stuck or locked and will not engage. Annoying to no end.,3.0
Really small,3.0
Handle bar swivels too much and makes it challenging to ride for a 6 year old.  And very annoying that it topples over easily with no way to prop it up.,3.0
"The wheels are not like bikes or cars. They are solid stuffs covered by a very thin layer of some sort of plastic (enlarge the picture in the product page to see). So when you ride it, you will feel all the toughness of the ground. Other than that, it is very good.",3.0
The kids love it. Easy to store away. Does not take much space.,3.0
"I should have checked the size before I got this. If you are an Adult, please get an adult sized one. LOL, but its smooth. Just that it vibrates on pavements and isn't as smooth as it is on wood.",3.0
These is a good scooter for this price.,3.0
"We bought these scooters for our 6 and 9 year olds. Works great for my 6 year old, but the handlebar does not come up high enough for the 9 year old to use comfortably. We had some old, original razor scooters and the handlebars on those come up 4 inches higher than on these new scooters. I assumed that with a weight limit of 143lbs it would work for a kid who is well under 5 feet tall. For shorter kids the scooter is fun and seems to be well made.",3.0
the base to put your feet on is kind of small compared with other options... that's the trade off for having it be more compact/foldable i suppose but it reduces control/comfort.,3.0
OK I guess,3.0
"The lever for opening and close is difficult to operate.  The base to stand on is only 11-3/4"" too short; my 5-year old son is able to place both feet on with one at about 30 degree angle but 7-year old son cannot have both feet on the base.  Recommend base length is 18"".",3.0
This is not the scooter we received. It didn't have tassels or a bell like the picture shows. We kept it because our daughter's birthday was the next day but I was disappointed that we didn't get the one pictured. I only ordered it because of those features.,3.0
it breaks easily,3.0
It is to hard to close it. It cannot be easily folded close by a child.,3.0
"This is not what I wanted. The description said this was the original, instead I got a redesigned scooter that is meant for smaller children, clearly what the 5+ was for.
I used to have this particular design from Razor and have been a 5'5"" Mexican for at least 15 years since owning the original.
I specifically remember being able to raise the handle bars well above my head and being able to place both my feet on the board.
The handle bars on this model barely come up to my belt line and can not be raised any higher than that because there is a locking mechanism preventing this. What is even the point of the collar lock if you can barely raise the handle bars higher than the picture?

Like, I seriously want to try and see if I can ride this thing the way it is, because I actually needed this thing, but I'm afraid the company won't take it back if there's barely a scratch on the damn thing.",3.0
"Bought this for my son when he was seven.  He is now ten and still will play with it from time to time.  Great first scooter for the price.  But the front wheel would always turn sideways and he would end up having to stop riding and turn the wheel beck to the forward position.  Never seemed to bother him though.  He was always having fun, but it is something I would notice.",3.0
The price was great and it was just like any other scooter with the exception that the foot space was small. You aren't able to get both feet on there which is lame. My daughter is 6 so she doesn't mind but I thought it should have been the same length as any other scooter.,3.0
Great scooter,3.0
It wasn't as high of a quality scooter as I expected it to be but thankfully my 9 year old daughter is tiny and not very rough.  It's small and suited better for a child under 6 years old.  It does fold flat which is great for storage and my daughter loved it.,3.0
For some reason it does not fold. Otherwise it is good,3.0
"for kids, it's fine.  For adults buy the RAZOR brand adult one.",3.0
"It's ok, could be a bit taller though. That's why I gave three stars.",3.0
This scooter is NOT FOR ALL AGES!! Very good scooter for ages 5-10. Not preferred for any age higher than that. Overall very strong and good. Don't rides this where the sidewalk is cracked though.,3.0
Cheap price and the wheels attract dirt easily and don't slid as fast due to its tiny wheels,3.0
"Perfect for my kids to shred up the ballpark while wating for their siblings game to end.. or just scooting around the neighborhood.  Very lightweight and durable.

Handle adjusts easily and keeps its setting, tucks away easily in car etc.

**UPDATE** 11/3/2017
After fairly regular use at various places.....

I have had to do some interesting work (hammer and cold chisel to lock nuts in place) on the lock nuts at the bottom of the handle.  Wheel would not stay aligned with the handle.

Also the scooter is now incredibly difficult/impossible to collapse.  Release lever doesn't function well anymore.

Reducing to 3 stars",3.0
"I got this for my son, it's a great scooter but what I really bought this one for was the folding feature. It did work really well in the beginning (we got it 1 month ago) but since then the lever that you use to make it collapse has gotten stuck? Not too sure, but it won't collapse anymore :( When it does collapse its great for storage!",3.0
Too small for my 8 years old to stand on with both feet.,3.0
"Not the same quality as the old ones, and made in China now.  It works, just not as well as the old ones - I guess I should've expected that for the price.

The foot pad is pretty small for an adult to use, a size 10 shoe barely fits between the head tube and the brake cover.",3.0
"I gave this a neutral rating because it's not very safe. Lol
I would walk this product to school for my son in one hand and my dog in the other. The bottom flips all around and kept hitting me in the back of the leg when I tried to straighten the product back out. Needless to say, I had a giant bruise for weeks. Very fast scooter. My son needs to learn to control it. I wouldn't buy this product again but would buy from the seller again.",3.0
It's okay,3.0
Not height adjustable and a bit short for my 7 year old.,3.0
Just ok.,3.0
Started making suspicious squeaks when trying to brake several days into use. Wheels are so tiny that the slightest bump on the road can throw the rider off.,3.0
Cheap tires,3.0
We have a hard time getting this to fold. We had to watch a YouTube video to figure out how to lift (unfold) it for the first time. It really hasn't been folded since. I think models vary. We have the one with the black plastic shown here in the picture. I think the other (metal) folders more easily.,3.0
"This was so cute for my 6 year old, with the tassels and the bell.  She loves it, but I was super disappointed that the tassels came off with in hours of her opening the box.  She did not yank on them, they just pulled out.  They just aren't well attached at all!  Aside from that, it is a good scooter for a child. But if it is the tassels that you love (as I did), then you might be disappointed.",3.0
"Was a little too small for me (19 year old boy) but tons of fun. It will not survive continual heavy use, so as long as you're not doing tricks and jumping stairs this is a great purchase for a smaller child",3.0

"Looks just like the picture. However, it was pretty clear that the one I received had been opened due to the box being ripped and not closed properly. I was under the impression that I was purchasing a new scooter but it appears I received a returned one. Also, there is no paperwork what-so-ever. Just would have been nice to actually receive a new one as stated. Too late to return and get another one before Christmas.",3.0

Smaller than I expected ...,3.0
ok ma son having fun..,3.0
This is a great scooter for rideing to school or just around the neighborhood. It rides smooths. But of you want a trick scooter you have to make changes to it but that can be done and now my son loves it better then a cheep trick scooter. Thank you,3.0
I'm sitting on the fence on this one. I got it for my tall 12 year old niece (she's 5'4). I feel that the handle does not go up far enough. My 4 year old loves to use it with the handle at the max level and she's of course much smaller ! My niece liked it just so-so. Otherwise it's a good quality scooter. I like that it folds easily and the metal rather than plastic.,3.0
It was great gift for my daughter. She liked it a lot.,3.0
"Review for an 11 year old boy: It was great at first but after a while of use, the handle bar pads cracked and came off and then the steering basically stopped working. This is my 3rd Razor scooter and the same things happened with all of them.",3.0
Nice,3.0
Front wheel bolt regularly loosens,3.0
Not very stable. Surface riding on must be extremely smooth for a smooth ride or else expect possible falls.,3.0
"I really like to warn potential buyers several things:
1) regarding seller's poor service, they charge re-stocking fee and don't cover shipping cost if you need to return the product. Please be cautious when you make a decision.
2) regarding the scooter, this one should not be described as ""fit adults"" since the height of handle is way to short for a regular adult.",3.0
Can't adjust the hight. Too big for four year old.,3.0
The streamers are getting ripped off easily. Otherwise nice scooter.,3.0
"The Scooter is good but I must be honest a and tell you that I have two and they both are wobbly at the handle pole/bar.  I just hoped that they would fix that as it causes it to wobble as you ride it...  Now if that doesn't matter to you than go ahead and try one  they are fun, I weight a little more that the 140 lbs  it says but who is going to tell the scooter police....  It is fun and gets you from point a to point be and can g=keep up great with someone on a bike!",3.0
"It is too small for 8 year old, also very small space to stand. It is OK if you will scoot just a little bit. Overall very light (I guess this is good?)",3.0
The kids love it.  But I don't like how the grips are already starting to deteriorate from sun contact after only a couple months.  Besides that it works well.,3.0
"The scooter is fun, but this one broke early.  Didn't open properly from the beginning.  Within a few weeks the handlebars would constantly move to the right or left and have to be adjusted.  Within 3 months the piece to close it came off.  Razor was great about replacing it, but I prefer a new product work well from the get go.  We have a blue one that essentially did the same thing, it just took longer, about 9 months, to break.",3.0
Pretty decent scooter and packs easily when transporting.  The daughter really likes and used it a lot more than her bike.,3.0
Streamers fell out almost immediately.  Pretty disappointing for my 6 year old!,3.0
"Too short for me to ride without hurting my back, even at the highest extention. I'm only 5'4''so I would maybe not recommend this scooter for adults.",3.0
"The scooter works fine.  The first day used, the decorative pom-poms fell out.  It was kind of disappointing because that was the feature our daughter was excited about.",3.0
Really not well made! Not made at all for more then just a quick ride around the driveway.,3.0
This scooter is very small; handle does not extend enough & the platform is for a small foot; this scooter is not for taller kids (middle school).  The spec's noted on the website were not helpful at the time of purchase.,3.0

I bought this Scooter for my 6yr old twin son because my other son got a similar scooter as a Christmas gift. Functionality wise both scooters as same but with one big disappointment. The one I already had has a lighted wheel whereas this one does not. I researched so much on the product description and nowhere it was mentioned that the wheel is not lighted. Manufacturer model number was also not mentioned. Otherwise I would have caught that before placing the order. My son was very disappointed and I had to convince him that I will get a replacement lighted wheel when the existing wheels wear out. The reason I give three star beacuse of seller's intention to not disclose enough information to the consumer to make informative decision. Lessons learned.,3.0
Fell apart after a few months of use by my very slim 10 year old daughter.,3.0
"OMG! OMG! OMG!  This is what my 5 year old said when he opened it.  This is the absolutely perfect scooter for someone 5 to 11, as long as they are under 140 pounds.  He ran around the entire house all morning (you know what morning) riding it back and forth.  For little guys like mine, I suggest a helmet and knee pads at least.  He played cops and robbers on his cop motorcycle.  He pretended to be racing on it.  It is his indispensable favorite gift of 2014.  This was even more popular than his train set which was a lot bigger and more expensive.  You know you hit a great product when it can with stand the abuse of a 5 year old boy.  It is very well made.  I expect it to last for years.

UPDATE: My son actually crashed because the handle bars are defective.  He is okay, but I no longer recommend this for anyone under 8.",3.0
it is ok but it has only a function to go. it is acceptable for the price.,3.0

i have one with lights (bought from target during last black friday) and thought this one also comes with lights but this one doesn't have lights.,3.0

My 7 year old has had one for 3,years and is really good with it, but the wheels are bigger and he's a bit more agile.  If you are concerned about safety your kid falling, spend the extra money and get the YBIKE 3 wheel scooter.  It's more stable, but less cool",3.0

"I bought this for my daughter as part of her birthday present this past February.  Unfortunately, being a winter birthday she couldn't go outside and use it except for a couple days when the weather has gotten better(it's late March right now).  However, she has been scooting around the house for the last few weeks and has gotten the hang of it pretty well.  All the neighborhood kids already have these scooters so it'll be nice for her to race her friends!

I'm giving it an OK rating because aside from assembly being super-simple(just unfold it and it 'clicks' in place) and looking like good quality(that's why I went with the Razor name instead of a cheaper alternative) it has already started loosening around the headtube.  It's to the point where the front wheel can completely turn a different direction than the handlebar if you put the lightest pressure on it!  I'm almost afraid to let her go outside now and use it on the sidewalks(she does have a matching Razor helmet which I always make her wear).  It's only been used in the house for a few weeks and shouldn't fall apart like this!

Unfortunately, I don't have a big enough wrench nor do I know what size headtube wrench to buy on Amazon.  We've had numerous bikes at the house over the years and I can't remember ever once having to tighten the headtube.  I wonder if this is a common issue?  If anyone knows the answer to my questions I would greatly appreciate it!

"Bought this for my 4 year old, but he can't really use it yet. I wish the handlebar adjusted to different heights because I don't think he would be able to use it for a few more years. I also find it kind of tricky to fold and open, but maybe that's just me.",3.0

"Cute scooter and pink like my little girl likes everything, but the paint job on the scooter is terrible.  It barely scrapes the ground and is flaking off.  You are better off with the silver based Razor scooters (we have one for our son and it has held up fantastic.)  I'm sure this will hold up fine, but won't be so pink after a while.  The streamers are coming off easily as well.  Just stick with your standard Razor scooter.",3.0
Lightweight and easy to handle but not much room on the actual standing in length and width making it a little more challenging for the younger set.,3.0
"Scooter didn't make it here on time for xmas as promised. The child went without as he was only here for the day. The scooter is probably okay, don't really know since child already went home and now he won't get it until another visit down the road. It looks sturdy and is adjustable. Opening and closing takes a little effort but folds down nice and compact. Handles adjust for height so that should be okay. Like i said, looks sturdy but has not been tested since it didn't make it on time and child has not tested it yet.",3.0
"We gave this to our son for his third birthday. He's average height and the scooter fits him well when in the lowest position. He's young, so there is a learning curve for it and he is still improving, but he has quickly learned how to balance and is now getting down a quicker speed. I bought it because I liked that it can grow with him, and I expected it to last because of the experience we had with our daughter's scooter. This last week, however, after having it for one month, he brought it to me with the insides of the handles dangling out. Now, he might have played with it a little, but the bungee that holds them on has now broken and it makes me not trust the collapsable handles. The handles are also connected to the scooter by a bungee cord when they are folded down for travel, and now I don't believe that I can fold down the handles as this bungee is likely to break as well. I couldn't recommend this product because of that. Let's face it, the handles coming off would make it a really awkward skateboard.",3.0
"This scooter is ""okay"" for a small child, but if your daughter is anything like mine and loves her scooter-time, you'll be better off getting the A5 model, which we upgraded to after 6 month.  It has thicker tires and rides much more smoothly, even when an adult gets on it!",3.0
"The scooter is a nice model but the floor board is much smaller than we expected. My son is 13 and wears a size 8. His foot barely fits the floor board. The adjustable handlebar also does not reach to a great height. He picked this out online and neither of us saw a lot of detail saying it was for smaller kids, but it appears to be.",3.0
"it is good enough for now, but it is a little cheap and won't last too long.  going to upgrade when my daughter gets a little older.  go for a better model.",3.0
Unfortunately my son isn't happy with it because the handle is too low and doesn't get higher. If he was shorter- he's seven- or if it got higher - we'd give it 5 stars.,3.0
"We've heard lots of good things about these scooters and decided to give it a try.  After only a single day the bearing ring broke in the steering column and now it will barely turn.  I'm going to have to buy replacement parts already.  Apparently the factory ring is made of plastic, but the replacement is metal.  Hmmmm....",3.0
"This is the 3rd Razor A Kick Scooter that I have purchased, in as many years, so, obviously, I like the product. However, with this particular scooter ( I purchased two), the big attraction was the added features, of the bell and streamers. I was very disappointed that they were both cheap, and not very functional (streamers were as flimsy, as paper, and started shedding, right away,out of the box. The bell was no better...hard to make a ring, with the little plastic knocker, on the tiny little bell)...I would have preferred paying a little more, for quality, durable, functional, added features. I was very pleased with the color, since one girl wants pink, and the other purple, and this color satisfied both. Just, give us a better bell and sturdier, heavier plastic, streamers.",3.0
My son is 8 and really wanted an original kick scooter... The only thing that we don't like is that the handle bars don't go up high enough :(,3.0
It is okay. I bought it for commuting to school. It is not too small for me but I feel little uncomfortable riding this. (I am college student) but its okay.,3.0
"Looks Like a very well made product, but it folds only once. I thought this was a neat concept for transporting , EXCEPT the folding mechanism doesn""t function. Now I'm dealing with all the requirements to prove it is not working. A STRING OF PHOTOS ! The product with full photo, folding lever and model sticker. Along with the receipt.
 I now have trouble E-MAILING ALL OF THIS.  HOPE TO FIGURE THIS OUT!",3.0
"The scooter has had only one use, but it should be enough for this review.

It works, it gets you from place A to place B provided you have the leg strength and the leg endurance, especially the leg endurance since you'll feel every small bump on whatever surface you're traveling on.  On top of that, the steering is a bit wonky: everything I did, whether it be a push forward or a slight turn, would make the steering rapidly switch left and right despite holding the handlebars stable; I was afraid the whole handlebar would turn a sharp 90 and send me flying forward.",3.0
"My son really likes these things. I bought this on sale and he enjoyed it, but after awhile, the foam on the handle bars started coming off. We kept it in the garage (they are not inside toys, after all) so the elements may have been a factor. That's my primary complaint, though. It's a fun scooter, juts not very durable. My son is only 4 and has small hands, and wasn't particularly hard on this scooter.",3.0
I purchased the razor scooters and they have functioned pretty good. They have had minor problems like some loose screws and the folding mechanism sometimes sticks but all in all my grandson is enjoying his scooter.,3.0
I bought this for my nephew after reading all of the good reviews.  He rode it three times and the last time he came back with the lock to the handlebars broken off.  He said he fell down and it broke.  I thought something built for kids would last longer than three rides.  Would not recommed to others.,3.0
"I bought this for my 9 year old son (he's in touch with his ""pink"" side)and he was so excited, but after a couple of tail whips and a few jumps it started to really loosen up and get jiggly.  We've retightened it numerous times but I think its just made for more moderate riders.  Looked cool though.",3.0
ok item but missing the tipping bar in the back.  by the time you buy this additional must have part the scooter turns to be more expensive than Walmart.  It bought my first one at Walmart for my other son and came complete for a great price.  Thombs down!!,3.0
"I have owned my Razor A2 Kick Scooter for many years now. Being a kid, I always had to have ""the latest"", or more commonly, ""the coolest"". When all my friends began bragging about their super cool new Razor scooters, I just had to have it. I instantly found it on Amazon and spent all my Amazon gift certificates I had been saving.
When it came I was so excited. I made plans to roam the streets in my new scooter! I was pretty satisfied for the first few weeks with the scooter's performance, then I got caught up with school work and soon, the scooter was forgotten (obviously the ""newness"" had worn off or possibly it hadn't held my interest,  hmm..).  I eventually got a very nice bike and rode it every day, especially enjoying making wide turns across the street (which was not the safest choice, you kids out there!).
One day, while searching the garage for my bike helmet I stumbled upon an ancient artifact- my old scooter! I decided to test it out and see how well I could still ride it. Of course I had grown some, which was one of the flaws with the scooter... there is a limit to how high the handlebars could be raised.
I rode into the driveway and as the first wheel hit the small space between my driveway and the sidewalk- you know... where those little wooden bars are? -the whole scooter tipped over!  I thought, either I'm not used to this scooter, or it isn't very stable. So I continued into the road. Expecting to make a large U-turn on the little scooter I turned the handles and quickly the bike stopped and fell over giving me a minor bruise to the forearm.
I know, I know- you probably think I'm just some reckless person who was just really stupid with handling my scooter. But I must say, I looked at the scooters handles and thought the two handles where your hands go were pretty close to each other. I compared them to my bike's handles and was surprized.  The scooter's handles were really close to each other. Now if you like sensitive steering (tiny movements which turn more than you think), the scooter would be no problem for you. But being a bike rider, I like big wide turns.
So here is my list of pros and cons. My opinions may not be even relevantly close to yours, but hey, that's what makes it an opinion.
Pros:
* These scooters make good birthday presents for kids ( I would recommend ages 6 - 11 but all kids are different)
* There are five pretty cool colors: black, blue, purple, red, and green
* The handlebars have a squishy feel and are pretty comfortable
* The metal bottom part of the scooter where you stand has a rough sand-like texture so you won't slip off while riding
* It folds in half for easy transportation as well as the handles folding up
* The brake located on the back helps to stop quickly
Cons:
* The handlebars are somewhat hard to steer
* The surface on which you drive needs to be pretty smooth (rough surfaces: hard to maintain speed... cracks or ridges: tipping over)
* The handles can't adjust to every height, so if you are at least 5 feet tall, riding MAY become difficult... same with adjusting smaller, the handles might be too high if you aren't particularly tall
* It does require a little practice before being able to ride it perfectly... but I suppose that's not really a ""con"", is it?

NOTE: If a stick or a rock is in the path of this scooter and you don't want to bother going around it... let me save you the trouble by saying, just go around it!

This scooter can be fun to ride as long as it suits you...
I'm not really against, or for this scooter. And I am not trying to make you buy, or not buy this product. I just want you to think through the pros and cons before you buy this... unlike I once did.",3.0
"I ordered 4 of these scooters, 2 out of 4 arrived defective. One of the scooters arrived without the latch needed to tighten and loosen the handle bars so you can adjust the height. Another scooter arrived and the right handle bar wouldn't fit into the slot so I had to bang it in with a hammer, its now stuck. This scooter is good for what its worth, but you can get them cheaper at Walmart or Target. You cant ride over any speed bumps or you will get stopped by it because the floor to scooter distance is short. And the littlest pebbles can make you crash.",3.0
"Plain and simple, this is a cheap scooter. Therefore, I didn't expect much from it. I am 24 and I use this in my office to ride around at work.  It works fine for that.  It doesn't work great on the street.  It is a little small for someone that is 5' 11'', and yes, there are much better versions out there.",3.0
"This is my son's second scooter-same model as before.  It is moderatly durable if it is going to be well taken care of.  My son leaves it out in the yard all year long.  It seems it has a life span of a year.  The reason I did not get the upgraded model was that children grow so quick.  And also one month my son will love his skateboard, the next a scooter and then the bike, so there is no need to spend a lot of money if it is used for a short period of time.  He likes it just fine.",3.0
"My young daughter loves her pink Razor. I love to watch her scooting around with her friends getting fresh air and sunshine.  It is so much better than video games. She is not yet able to collapse this for storage.

As a person with arthritis I hate it!  It is extremely difficult for me to engage the lever which collapses the steering flat onto the foot platform.  More often than not, I find myself asking someone else to collapse the scooter or bringing it home fully upright.

If you have any sort of joint issues in your hands and children who are too young to close this for storage/transport, please remember that this is difficult to collapse.",3.0
this is good product. my 7 year old loves it...! except for the handle grip... it start developing a tear and can create risky grip for the rider...!,3.0
"This is a really light and fast scooter. I like it because I can do pretty much any trick possible on it. The only thing I hate about it is after I did a little 3' gap the part where it folds bent, so now its slanted back and scrapes on the ground when I try to do certain tricks. I think Razor chould make that part unbendable like their old ones because I'm sick of buying the new ones and keep bending them. Razor could atleast start selling them for $10 if their not going to make them stronger or the could just sponser me and give me free one because this ain't cool!",3.0
The net ripped pretty quickly.,3.0
Great training tool. Suggestion to dedicate a ball to it because its hard to get it out of the net. Also the bungie broke after a few uses but I tied it back and it works great.,3.0
"Bungee cord broke within 10 minutes of using it.  So I bought a stronger bungee cord (with carabiners on the ends) and tried again.  The clip then broke after about 10 kicks.  Fortunately, I could just attach the carabiner to the stake.  Once I got parts that didn't break immediately, I had a good time.  No more chasing the balls all over the field.
This product is a great idea, but the equipment provided is pretty bad.  The corkscrew stake and the ball net are good, though.",3.0
just use your ball instead!,3.0
"not great quality, but it works for my 8 year old budding soccer player.  The belt is hard to use, the netting was really cheap, had to thread the thing together and tie with string to the stretchy cord.  You CAn't remove the soccer ball unless you cut the net or string.  I was expecting a better product.  : !",3.0
"This was as described and works, but did leave my daughter with rope burn on her ankles, so would recommend long pants if wearing (which is not something soccer players normally wear)",3.0
it was easy to use somewhat challenging to figure out from instructions.  But the equipment seemed to be decent enough,3.0
I find it takes too long to set up (everything needs to be tied instead of coming somewhat assembled) and switching between the in-ground unit and the body or hand-held units is tedious.  But it ultimately works the way it is supposed to.,3.0
The corkscrew anchor is very high quality.  The red ball nets are string-based and can scuff/break if not used on a soft surface.  The elastic cord broke pretty quickly with correct use by a 10 year old girl on grass.,3.0
Not a very easy thing to assemble. great price if you have the time. Came in about a week and i gave it away.,3.0
"For a beginner, this is a good start up kit but would like for the net bag to be of better quality, more durable.",3.0
"Assembly is a bit of a hassle, better if the tether were preassembled.  Instructions are straight forward. Product works as described.",3.0
"Enthusiasm for an instructor is exactly what's needed - but Leslie's constant giggling, laughing and chatting takes away from the momentum that you're trying to achieve...it get annoying and I find I can only do this one day and must switch to something more challenging.",3.0
"The walking program is very good, but in order to maximize the workout for ABS (which is why I purchased it) a belt is needed.  This piece of equipment is not pictured, or mentioned on the cover. Without the belt it's just another DVD for walking.",3.0
This one is good using the weights gives you a good work out. However if you use heavier weights it is difficult to keep up the walking and raising the weights above your head. You may want to only use light weights with this workout.,3.0
"I agree with the disappointment in how the DVD is set up.  It really is no better than a VHS.  The only advantage you have is not having to remember to rewind when you are done.  It's not much, but after awhile you resent being held hostage through the warnings and logos at the beginning that you can't fast forward through, and the lack of chapters is disappointing.

The other thing these DVDs need is a feature where you can turn off the talking and just have music like Tamilee Webb has on many of her DVDs.  You either like Leslie or you don't, but I bet that she could increase sales among those who like the workouts but hate the chatter by including this feature.  If you're going to make a DVD, you might as well give it some DVD features.

I like the workouts on her WATP-Abs for themselves.  I like wearing the belt, although you'd do just as well with a stretch band or weights.  I'm not convinced they really do work the abs, but they definitely work your upper body.  It does seem odd that her excercisers for the most part are not wearing the belt correctly--they have it on quite loosely.  I would LOVE, however, to be able to chapter ahead to the cooldown when I don't have 45 minutes to exercise.  I do have the shorter workouts, but they are not as challenging as the 3 mile.",3.0
I had Sigg bottles for years and I keep buying them. This new one came with a dent in it already.,3.0
"Sigg water bottles are very well made and the metal is heavy gauge.  I like the fact that they hold a good amount of liquid too.  The colors are great and there are a number to choose from.  They wash up nicely and the outside color does not chip.  I just wish their bottles had a pull-up/push-down drinking spout.  It is cumbersome to have to screw the lid off and on every time you want to drink while in the car.  Otherwise, it's a high quality, well-made bottle.",3.0
The outside of the bottle was streaked and not uniform in color like it is pictured.  It holds the right amount of liquid but seems to have a thinner wall than other Sigg products I have purchased in the past.  I have not traveled with it in my checked suitcase so I'm not sure how it will be yet.  It is okay but not excellent.,3.0
"I bought two of these 1L bottles at two separate times. After 6 months the first one started to peel from the inside. I figured it was a fluke or my fault since I had dropped it quite a few times. Im writing this review because today, the second bottle after a year of use also started to peel on the inside and I really treated this one well. I even bought the fancy sigg brush and didn't use any sort of harsh chemicals and it still happened. Kind of disappointing.",3.0
"I thought it would be more durable. Within a month it accidentally fell on a rock, leaving a hole, and ultimately unfit to hold water.",3.0
"wish the opening was bigger.
hard to keep clean.",3.0
"I turned to Sigg for a quality product that would last. True to the other reviews, it doesn't leak, which is a huge plus. But the body doesn't hold up to even basic daily usage--it dings and dents way too easily. At this price point, I expected more durability.",3.0
"The lid is hard for the kids to take off, hard for them to close without leaks, and easy to lose.

The bottles are a bit of a pain to clean.  I wish they were dishwasher safe or even just had a larger opening.

The opening is also too small to load with ice.

The bottles dent and the coating chips.

All that said I haven't found a better option that is small enough to fit in the kid's lunch bags.",3.0
Great product but it would have been great if it has been well protected when it was send. The bottle has a impact on the bottom and not awesome when you want to give it as a gift.,3.0
"I received a 1.0 liter Sigg water bottle, but the color was different than the ""Reflex Blue"" shown on the web site. What I received was a very dark blue/purple color. I used to own a Reflex Blue Sigg bottle, so I know that color exists, but that's not what I got.",3.0
"I liked the bottle, but it dents really easily so after about a month, it looked pretty old. A bit heavy too, compared to other brands that I've seen.",3.0
"The Sigg Water bottle is light, good looking, leak-proof,and delivers a fresh clean-tasting drink of water. As far as I'm concerned though, it has a major flaw.  There should be a way to secure the top after opening.  I want to use it for active outside sports and can't always stop for the time it takes to open, drink, and get the top back on.  Who wants to put on a top that has fallen in the dirt?  And one bad bounce means I've lost the top entirely.",3.0
"This was a little slippery.  I usually prefer a rug.  Still, it's a good portable option, something you can just keep at class.",3.0
"It's almost a necessity to use a yoga mat. I didn't think so when I was taking the yoga class at a local gym, because we never used them. When the gym closed and I started using DVDs and tapes for yoga, I hurt myself. I was in a triangle position, and one of my feet started to slide. Because I was on carpet, there was nothing for my toes to grip. My foot slid, and I could hear muscles (or something) tearing. I wasn't able to stop my foot from sliding, and it just kept going further and further. I guess I tore some groin muscles. For several weeks, I wasn't able to do much beyond stand upright. It even hurt to walk. But I sure learned that I should use a yoga mat. I'd hate for you to have to learn through the same experience.",3.0
"These muffs work great for shooting and other short term uses.  The electronics work well, allowing you to hear conversations and other low volume sounds while blocking loud noises.  The spring steel headband holds the earpieces tightly, perhaps too tightly.  After wearing them for a day of working with a chain saw it felt like I had had my head in a vice.  I tried them again a week later with the same resulting headache.  I don't use them now for anything that requires more than about 15 minutes of continuous wear.",3.0
The directions on how to put in the batteries is nonexistant.  I had to visit a couple youtube videos before I found how to open the battery campartment.  Once I figured that out the product works very well.  The noise cancelling properies  work as advertised.  the quality is very low.  I had to bend one of the battery brackets back into place in order to install the battery and this was a new one fresh from the factory.,3.0
Good noise suppression.  Batteries are difficult to remove or replace which you are suppose to do after each use.,3.0
"I'm writing this before I've actually used the earmuffs. Had to buy four AAA batteries, which are installed by popping off the plastic pads. Had quite a struggle to get the pads to snap back onto the muffs. Not something I would want to have to do in the field or under time constraints. Kyle Lamb recommended these as what he wears for tactical uses, saying he preferred push-button controls to knobs for on/off and volume controls. Turns out these use knobs, too. NRR is only 20 dB, quite a bit less protection than my Howard Leight's. If they don't give superb performance when I do get to use them, they will be going back.",3.0
Expected better quality,3.0
The filters keep popping off but otherwise good,3.0
"I own 4 pairs of these none of which I purchased through Amazon. They have performed adequately, but two of the items now have one side which will not function. I have disassembled, checked circuit boards for damage, checked batteries and cleaned and inspected contacts, but no luck. Each is out of warranty but I still use them for shooting because I can still converse via the remaining function side though monaurally. I'm not too upset because these are 6-10 years old and have served me well. As has been previously noted, the battery change procedure is unnecessarily difficult.
I am transitioning to Howard Leight muffs because they have an audio input jack which can be used with two-way radios (also iPods, if you're into that)",3.0
The main drawback of these muffs is the fact your have to separate the muff to install a battery.  It is a bear getting the muff apart and then putting them back together.,3.0
"Great when working. Very good sound sealing with glasses. High failure rate. I have two pair bought a few years apart but both had one side fail. Not sure what part caused the failure, The IC board or microphone. I cannibalized one good side and made one working headset.",3.0
"removing the cups to replace the batteries is a royal pain, never buying again",3.0
fits good. allows for goggles. I think it was a good choose.,3.0
"Once tuned it works well, and I can hear others talk as clearly as without the muffs.

Problems:
- Could not tune the right muff.
- Removing muff to install batteries very, very difficult.
- Battery brackets look cheap. I wonder how easy it would be to knock them loose during use.",3.0
"Great for our needs. Remodeling a home and needed protection from sawdust, insulation dust and dirt in general.",3.0

I would NOT recommend this.",3.0
"Update to the previous product review ....
I called the company @ 1-888-MSA-How2  ... and explained the defect ..

This thing can definitely filter out the bad stuff ... When it sits properly in your face and mouth. If your jaw is large don't even bother.,3.0
Works fine. It does not have a fastening clip so it has to be pulled off and on which will stretch it out quickly,3.0
Not really worth the money,3.0
"I prefer the older design without the adjustment made for the bridge of the nose, this newer version did not fit me as well.",3.0
You need the back end of a toothbrush to pry the pads off and change the battery. The switches get caught in my bag and turn on. I have started putting them in a secondary bag to protrect the switches. They are not as sensitive as my older set that used a 9V battery. They also are not as protective as my old set when sitting next to a 300Win Mag. The set is compact and I like the AA battery set up in each side.,3.0
"Worked great for a while, but the tiny plastic piece for strap adjustment broke, so now it is unusable....",3.0
"I bought this to do some work in my attic. I have 24"" of cellulose insulation, so just crawling around up there makes lots of dust.

Pros
- The rubbery part of the mask is very rubbery. Possibly silicone. I have a thick, full, manly beard. While I'm sure some air leaked through the tiny spaces between the hairs, I still had a really good seal.
- The straps are comfortable and easy to adjust. Tip: place the top strap almost on top of your head.
- I had good airflow even when breathing heavy from doing manly work.

Cons
The mask kinda small. While I have a thick, full, manly beard, my chin is not so manly. Even so I had to chose between having the bottom part of the mask not quite under my chin or have the top of the mask almost to the end of my nose. This would have 5 stars were it not for the smallishness.",3.0
OK,3.0
Not the best hearing protection. Worse at indoor ranges. Cheap ones do a better job but they do fold up compact.,3.0
This was great for about six months and then the seals stopped working.,3.0
"Great headsets, but one side stopped working shortly after I got it.",3.0
good investment,3.0
"only used it once. guess the thieves, or terrorists in the neighborhood got it.",3.0

"The 3M Peltor Tactical 6S was my first venture into electronic hearing protection.  I was either going to purchase the 3M model or the Howard Leight model for a similar price.  I honestly think I should've purchased the Howard Leights, although I haven't used them, I'm just kind of ""blah"" towards the 3M model.  As others have stated, installing/replacing the batteries is a major PITA.  Also, the knobs are very prominent and supposedly have a tendency to switch on when you're not using them.  I must note, this hasn't happened to me, but I can see how it would happen if you throw them in your range bag.  I see no purpose for the knob itself, the headphones are useless for me on all but highest setting.  It should be a simple on/off switch.  They also seem to run small.  I by no means have a ""big head"", but wearing glasses (as everyone should when shooting) I have to have the headband positioned very far forward and they are tight against my skull.  This can cause headaches if you are out on the range for more than a hour or so.  I still have them 3 stars because I've never used electronic hearing pro before and I love them compared to standard ear plugs or ear muffs.  I have significant hearing loss due to military service and I can't hear a damn thing with ""normal"" hearing protection.  So, donning these for the first time and being able to have some auditory situational awareness while shooting was awesome.  I will be purchasing a higher end model next time or an ""in ear"" type protection like the SportEar.  To summarize,they are worth the $50, but don't expect to impressed if you have experience with higher end electronic hearing protection.  Semper Fi.",3.0
"I've owned a few sets of the Peltor 6S for the last 18 months or so. I bought them in early 2013 during a great sale, and scored three sets for $110 (total) shipped. 3M Peltor is arguably the most recognizeable name in Ear Pro, so I was confident that these things would fit the bill, instead of opting for Leight's or far more expensive alternatives.

Sadly, they're barely worth the $37 I paid for them. Yes, they work satisfactorily at isolating gunfire noise and certainly keep your ears safe. That's about where the performance ends. I have other sets, including cheaper ones, that perform every bit as well at isolating the unwanted sounds. The difference comes in the sounds you actually WANT to hear. All three sets of the Peltor 6S' that I have perform identically, so I'm satisfied that my sample is reasonably representative of the whole. With the Peltor's, ambient sounds, including voices, etc, are dull and much of the surrounding noise isn't discernible at all -- even when turned ALL the way up. With virtually all of my other sets, including the Howard Leight sets, I can hear MUCH better than with the naked ear. All ambient noises are amplified while completely tuning out loud / harmful noises. This is great when you're out in the woods, or on a range where you need to hear the Marshall's instructions. In the woods, I can hear squirrels munching on nuts or crawling around in the trees, and even field mice under ground cover. None of these sounds are heard when using the Peltors.

The battery design was conceived by Rube Goldberg himself. I mean, seriously 3M -- why?! The plastic construction feels very cheap, and the posts that connect the headgear to the muffs seem to scream ""break me!"" I don't mind plastic / ""polymer"" at all, and many things made from plastic materials are very robust and nearly indestructible, however these Peltors don't inspire confidence in their potential durability. The muffs / cups themselves also feel very cheaply made, but they do make a seal sufficient enough to block harmful noise.

So, in a nutshell, these muffs ""work"", but they're barely satisfactory. I have a $20 set of cheap Caldwell's that run circles around these Peltors, and the Howard Leights are in another universe by comparison, for a small premium over the 3Ms.

My personal recommendation is, in this price range, go with something else, or step up to more expensive Ear Pro. I have a set of 3M ComTac III's and they're insanely good -- perhaps the best-ever -- but at $600 you'd expect them to be.",3.0
when in use wind direction is very noticable the volume knobs seam to rotate on their own and the battery does not last very long,3.0
"I bought these and a pair with the behind the head wire. Both work as advertised and are good on the range. However the little flaws noted in many reviews are more significant than I realized. Yes, the batteries are a pain to replace. I didn't think that would be a problem, but if you want to put a pair away you have to dig them out to avoid leaking. And the switches are too easy to turn on going in and out of range bags, so they can accidentally run out of power. You might not know until you get to the range. Far better are the ear protectors from Howard Leight: about the same price, but only 2 batteries, not 4. And a switch that is hard to accidentally turn. And far better still the Howard Leight model automatically shuts down after a period of time. As a bonus, the 2 batteries are easy to replace.

I was ok with these Peltors until I found the alternative. They work, but a much better option is available.",3.0
"It is a good respirator, well constructed, copmfortable and reliable. One no - not every pair of gogles can be worn simultaneously with it.

It is bulky, doesn't move air as easily as I would like it to and its strapping mechanism seems a bit weak to keep it tightly applied to my face. Incompatibility with glasses is a seriuos impediment.",3.0
"I love compasses. I don't go anywhere without one. In my car, in my backpack, on a plane, If I'm going out...a compasses is going with me.

I bought a Brunton 8099 a while back. I wasn't sure I liked the Brunton's circle in circle idea so I was hesitant to buy one. I finally decided to give it a shot and purchased one. After playing with the compass for an hour I decided I really liked it. I love the design of the compass although the rubber base gets in the way of opening up the entire top. But the 8099 has all the features you could want in a compass and then some. I liked it so much that I decided to buy a 2nd one a month later to have one in my camping stuff and one for local use.

After having these compasses for a while now, I am very sad to say that I will not recommend it to anyone. There are two huge reasons why I cannot.

1st.  The circle in circle idea. On the surface it sounds great. And when you see it in action, as a quick once over, it comes across as great an innovation as Brunton pitches it. And there pitch is that it is more accurate then the line compasses. However, if really put to the test it doesn't hold up. Why? This is a bit hard to explain in words but if you go to your local outdoors supplier and check it out, hopefully you can see what I am trying to get at. If you look straight down on the compass and align the circles all is fine and dandy. However, if you view the compass by the mirror or from a large angle (yes I know the center line down the mirror is so you are not looking at it from a left and right angle but bare with me), the accuracy comes into question.

To see this in action, place the compass on the edge of something solid and view the compass through the mirror set at the 45 degree position. Now if you change your view higher or lower you will see the circles start to appear misaligned. So of course your reaction is to turn the compass to align them. But if you were to look straight down at the compass you would see they are in fact not aligned now. And that viewing problem becomes more pronounced the closer to left and right the N and the blue circle are pointing. Just viewing the compass straight down and moving your head around a bit will show the same thing.

When you are out in the field and holding it by hand, you cannot guarantee that you are going to hold the compass at the exact same eye level every single time when viewing through the mirror. So the question becomes how do you really know when the compass is reading true.

So, the circle in circle sounds great, but it is flawed. I would prefer Brunton go back to the standard parallel lines. With the lines, even if you view the compass from an extreme angle, or the mirror isn't in the exact same position, you know when the compass is aligned right. How? Even if the needle doesn't `appear' to be centered with the guide lines, when viewing from an extreme angle, if the needle and the guide lines are parallel with other, then you know your compass is reading true.

2nd. As I stated above I bought two of these. Both formed bubbles in them without going to any extreme temperature or elevation. I sent both back and paid the $5 per compass fee for repair. One of them has once again formed a bubble. I don't even plan to send it back for repair.

I really really want to love these compasses. There is so much to them. But these two huge issues are keeping it down.",3.0
"I was dissapointed. Quality was poor overall. The cover was supposed to lock in various positions, but just flopped around helplessly. The indicator would only float freely when the base was held off-level. Lanyard interferes with cover action. I went out and bought a $15 cheapo that works better.

It does work however and the instructions were OK. I expected a much better quality instrument for the money I paid.",3.0
"There is no power indicating light so you don't eat batteries. There is no battery door. You have to snap BOTH of the clamshells apart with your fingernails to get into them. Then they take a AAA battery instead of a AA (more common).

"The Peltor 6S does a fine job of filtering out damaging, high frequency gunfire noise while clearly amplifying voices and other sound. Battery life is extraordinarily long. Unfortunately, the power knobs are located in a place where they are easily left on, or turned on by accident when putting the unit into storage. Replacing the batteries requires breaking the earpieces open, which calls for considerable hand strength or prying tools. Be prepared to tear an earcup cushion, as I did when trying to replace the batteries in my unit. Competitive brands offer similar performance with a better engineered battery compartment.",3.0
"1) To replace the batteries in them, get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle, with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to, which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft, rubber circle....

2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up, or throwing them around, thus dead batteries, thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have, thus, enduring #1 too frequently.",3.0
"Not quite the quality that my first Brunton 8099 is.  Obviously the product has been cost-reduced.  The cover is loose and flops around when it's supposed to be locked in the detent position.  Still... the dial resolution is better than any Suunto.  The 1:24000 scales are just right for USGS Topo maps.  A good tool, but suffering for quality.",3.0
We at weatherthestorm.com recommend this product for your disaster or survival kit. Great to use during recovery after a natural disaster.,3.0
"Do not skimp on a good respirator by buying disposables ones. Yes, the strap on this model can be prone to breaking as claimed by previous buyers. However, it is much stronger than the disposable ones which will break after several uses. Loosening the strap before removal will prolong it's longevity. For the price point and quality of the respirator, it's hands down 5 stars. I wish I bought this a couple weeks earlier when I was stripping out old paint. Currently, I am sanding down the ceiling and having a good respirator makes a world of a difference. The rubber nozzle contorts to your face and gives you a nice snug feeling. It is lightweight and comfortable. Works well with the Dewalt anti-fog protective glasses.

Edit -
After using this for a couple years, the head strap broke due to the stitching. I was able to salvage the respirator by using a staple gun. Downgrading the respirator from 5 stars to 3 stars.",3.0
Good compass but not worth the price. Plastic and a bit flimsy. Adjustments too tight. May give it to a friend and find another.,3.0
"This inexpensive respirator will serve the purpose.  Quality is not too good, filmy straps is not made to last. I think my old AO brand will last more then twice long.  If you need to use it often, get something better made.",3.0
"You are constantly removing the black rubber bottom cover that holds cards that have some useful information, but, if you are going to be using this with a map on a see through base basis, then it is a bit annoying, they do say it can be used for an eraser. The cover is supposed to have positive stops at various useful angles, mine has a partial one at about 45 degrees but not much. For my personal taste, the mirror is a bit too high, making you have to move the compass up or down so you can get your fix. The dial in dial declination system is quite easy to set and maintain, but I would have felt better if the compass pointer was a higher contrast color as the dark red is hard to align inside the dark blue circle accurately in low light conditions. The dial does not glow, so unless you have a flashlight to read it by then forget night travel if you strayed a little too far from camp because is would be near impossible to read a bearing to determine which fork in a trail to take.

For the novice, accuracy is going to suffer and there will be frustration enough to go around. In full sun it is a good compass, except for the price I paid Vs what I ended up with. It is much like a first time compass you would give a child to play with. I would have returned it except for the notation on the order that it contained materials that would not let you ship it back. I'll use it, but, not be happy with it just to justify the money I spent, and I WILL have a backup.",3.0
"As far as I can tell, this is an older version of the product. Brunton has now released another, similar-looking model that they're billing as an improvement on the Eclipse. I haven't tried the new version but I agree that this one needed some improvement.

It sounds good on paper but doesn't work as well in the field. First of all, I agree with Shadow Raven's critique of the circle-in-a-circle aligning system. On east-west bearings especially, when I move my head (or the compass) up and down, the alignment of the circles as reflected in the mirror changes. Second, the mirror mount is springy plastic and seems to change shape, helping to throw the sighting off. Repeat readings to a distant landmark from my window seem to vary through about a 3-degree range. When I tried mapping a known stretch of trail (0.8 miles each way) with the Eclipse, my ""going"" and ""coming"" plots differed by an astonishing 7 degrees. When I repeated the experiment with the Suunto Tandem two months later, the ""going"" and ""coming"" plots were within half a degree of each other. I'm planning to leave the Brunton at home from now on.",3.0
The compass is great and does exactly what it should. The storage for UTM and basic instructions is brilliant. The compass even comes with a code for 5 free US maps from National Geographic. Unfortunately someone has already used my redemption code.,3.0
"feels cheap- WHEN these break, I'll probably just stick w/ surefire sonic defenders...which are smaller, more durable, cheaper, lower profile and cooler in hot weather.  3M shouldn't put their names on these, but again, they work ok out of the box.",3.0
"It didn't come with instructions on how to put in batteries... We took it to a gunstore but the only way to get it open was to pry it open. It appears to have loosened a wire as the sound in the left ear goes in and out ... But of course to see if that is so, we'd have to pry it open again!!! Having said this, if it worked it would be perfect!!!",3.0
"Meh...

I bought these when a ""friend"" said they were better than the Howard Leights.  They're not.

They do the same job, but complicate the issue.  Instead of one battery compartment (like the HL's), there are two, one in each ear.

Rather than a single volume control, you now have one for each ear.  Great if you're a geriatric with varied hearing capacities in either ear, but just a nuisance when you want them both on the same volume anyways.

Changing the batteries is a PITA!  Just a really disappointing design, to be honest.  I'd recommend the HL's over these 100% of the time.  Same price and better design.",3.0
They work as intended but the first time I used them one of the volume knobs fell off as well as the microphone cover. I called the supplier but it seem that want me to send them the item for warranty. I just wanted to but the new parts.,3.0
Left mic/speaker has slight hiss... Only somewhat annoying. Battery/circuitry compartments are vulnerable to rough fingering when accessing batteries for storage removal or replacement.,3.0
"Battery compartment difficult to access.  Had to return item as one side was completely dead.  Replaced batteries, same result.  New purchase through Amazon,  Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport electronic Earmuff",3.0
"This hearing protector requires two batteries on each side (instead of only two total like the Howard Leight R-01526), and they are hard to change.  Although the individual volume controls are nice, one of the plastic volume knobs slid off the shaft the first time I used them.  I can't find it, so now I have the metal shaft exposed.  The other one is also easy to pull off, so I have to be careful not to lose it.  I'll probably glue it on.  Also, one of the mics pulled out and was hanging loose.  I was able to re-seat it, but you need to be careful not to pull them out.  A friend tried them out and said they wouldn't seal around his ears, so he put his non amplified ones back on. They only use the plastic enclosure and soft ear pieces to muffle sound...no sound dampening foam inside.  They are somewhat louder than the traditional larger non-amplified muffs.  I suppose they would work for me, but I'm sure there is something much better.  I'll keep looking.",3.0
I gave these to my bro. The MSA sordin are top notch and the best that I have tried yet.,3.0
"I bought this compass as a gift for my little sister for Christmas since she does a great deal of traveling.  When she received it, her first comment after the hearty, ""Thank you"" was, ""It isn't a digital compass though.""

And yes, despite the title being ""Brunton Nexus Elite Digital Compass"", it should merely read, ""Brunton Nexus Elite Compass"".  I'm still trying to figure out how to notify Amazon that the title is wrong, so I figured the easiest way was to just write it in the review.",3.0
"I was surprised how cheaply it was made annd how difficult it is to change the batteries.
Upon using it at the shooting range I found that it works well but the on/off/volume knobs are way too easy to turn and found one the left side had been turned on by just being in my shooting bag during the trip home,
The good news is that they get the job done for a low price.",3.0
"The current model of these is not what they used to be. I concurr with current reviewers on this major point.

I bought a set for my 11 year old for a shooting kit to go with his new Henry Golden Boy.

I've had a previous generation set for years and mostly like them for the audio and protection and slimness. And knowing the negatives of the somewhat difficult to change batteries and the exposed knobs often turning them on in the bag - with no auto-off - killing the batteries (thus getting into difficult to change batteries).

But I ordered a set for my 11 year old because I knew them well and he really liked the fit and feel.

I could immediately tell they were newer - the plastic moulding is (acceptably) different. I could not, without fear of wrecking the ear pads with excessive force, remove them to put in the batteries. Period. Pads would not come off without risk of damaging the pads. I trued the usual grips and angles I use on mine that help - but nope. So while I figured he'd have difficulty and need my help on batteries - I wasn't expecting myself, an experienced user of these, to find it impossible to access the batteries.

So when 3M bought this from Peltor - they ruined them. Poor quality control on fit and finish of pads and battery access make these unusable.

At the time I bought mine years ago - these were both the best and only in their class. That is not so now. Knowing the possibility I had also ordered and tried Howard Leight. Those my older son and I really like - but their rectangular pads won't cover the lower back corner of my 11 year old's ear/head. So I'm still searching for something for him. I may give him my older generation Peltor Tactical 6S and get Howard Leights or another perhaps higher end model for myself to replace them.

EDIT 3/18: Compared against Howard Leight's . The Audio is crisper than the Howard Leight's. No ""spacey"" sound. The Peltors didn't have as much gain (volume). The Howard's only had that ""spacey sound"" with volume turned up.

On the plus side - the cutout and in particular the recovery (cut-in) is FAST. I miss that attibute when I need more than 19db protection and use the Sport Tac 100s.

So I gave my 14 year old the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-Leight-R-01526-Impact-Sport-Electronic-Earmuff/dp/B001T7QJ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuff</a>&nbsp;and my 11 year old will probably get these (my older model pair).

As a side note - ALL of these Peltors are far improved in comfort by the HY80 gel seals. I highly recommend them. You've got to spend hundreds to get them by default - so consider that as an upgrade - you won't regret that purchase even if you defer it.

3M / Peltor - what have you done with a gold standard? Unfortunate but true.",3.0
"As others note, battery insertion is pretty hard and takes enough force that the plastic must be close to breaking.  My first set of these worked for an hour and then one earpiece stopped amplifying and instead it started buzzing and whining.  Amazon quickly replaced them (good job Amazon) and the new set has worked so far.  And I didn't break them putting in the batteries, but maybe next time?  Anyway, low profile, good at blocking sound, and the audio gain is sufficient to help with hearing people talk.",3.0
"There was two things that I did not like about this. First was the compass is dial is all in 2 degree graduation. I have a standard Silva map compass which 1 degree that is more accurate. Second, There is Inclinometer to measure slopes, It doesnt seem to work well. The 2 degree graduation is what makes me give a low rating. It would be find in a small place but not in a very large national park.",3.0
This compass seems like it will work fine but the price does not seem warranted. I am also irritated that it was shipped to me with a huge sticker covering the sighting mirror. This is proving to be very difficult to remove and to me it cheapens the product.,3.0
"This is the recommended compass for navigation classes with the local Mountaineer's club and it has all the desirable features, however I would have returned it had compasses been returnable--they are not as they are considered hazardous waste.

What bothered me was the country of origin as I try not to contribute to our massive trade imbalance with China.  It truly looked and seemed to work fine but I trust Chinese made products less due to many past problems with Chinese made replacement car parts.  Eventually I got rid of it and got a Suunto made in Finland.",3.0
"I haven't tried it outdoors yet, but it's useless for indoor ranges. With a NRR of 20, I need earplugs as well, and I still feel percussion. For indoor use I now have some bulky NRR 30 muffs.

"It works fine but it barely amplifies the normal hearing range.  The others I've used amplified the low end and cut out the loud stuff.  This seems to just cut of the loud stuff but in order to hear normally you have to have the volume all the way up.

Also, it is very hard to open and close to replace the batteries.  I struggled with it for quite some time.  Could not open it using the ""hand"" method as described in the instructions.  Fortunately it was not that costly or I would have sent it back.",3.0
"I wish someone would have posted this earlier as I bought two of these for use at an indoor range........

"Bought mine and they have been working fine.

I do agree with the volume knob being a pain in the ares and killing many batteries.

To remove the cups to change batteries leaves something to be desired.

Now to the new thing... my outer cups are cracking one has cracked from the top to almost the middle and the other about 3/4"" long from the top as well. I haven't seen any known issues online regarding this. It is not from abuse that is for sure. I have owned these for about 4 months. I love them but I guess I will have to find a way to reinforce them.",3.0
"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I've had these for about five years now, although they have been used infrequently.  My assessment.

Battery access is downright painful.  From a comment I read, the newer models may have a pry slot on the side for removing the ear pads for battery change.  Mine don't, but I'm considering carving one out.

Noise reduction is not that great.  Get next to someone shooting a magnum pistol at the range, and you will feel pain.  I've finally gone to Tom Gresham's method of wearing both foam earplugs and these.  In combination the noise reduction is very good, and with the built-in amplifier, you can still hear conversation and range announcements.

The good.  Nice OD color.  The headband fits over a baseball cap and shooting glasses.  Folded for storage, they are very compact.

Wish list.  It would be great if they came with built-in Lithium Ion batteries and charger connector.  The battery removal problem would go away, and Lithium Ion batteries don't have the problem of a high self-discharge rate in storage.

All things considered, I cannot recommend these even at the excellent amazon.com price (which is way less than I paid elsewhere several years ago.)

Added.  Yes, I know the pro models from Peltor are from two to three times the price of these, and if those are my only other choices, then this model does make sense.  I am not in the market for $170 earmuffs, regardless of their features!  Other mfrs may have better budget earmuffs, though.  I see some as cheap as $25.",3.0
I expected more from these Peltor . I am disappointed. they work fine on the sports shooting. But they practically do not amplify sounds when tracking game. Also upset about the lack of the original packaging. The brand label on it was blured. So is only three stars. :(,3.0
"This would have been 5 stars except for a couple flaws:

1. It's difficult to remove the cups to replace the batteries despite their warning that they should not be stored for extended periods of time with batteries.

2. It requires 4 batteries, 2 for each side.

3. The control knobs are situated very close to the hinges and may inadvertently switch them to the on position.

The actual protection is outstanding.

I also have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-Leight-R-01526-Impact-Sport-Electronic-Earmuff/dp/B001T7QJ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuff</a>&nbsp;which does not have ""active"" hearing protection (or at least not as apparent or dramatic as these) yet designed much better as far as usability.

"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically, like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs, they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.

However, when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room, construction site), they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.

Pros: Works well for the range

Cons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noise

Overall: 3/5 stars

I recommend using rechargeable batteries.",3.0
"J.Ong, Anaheim, CA
After reading the good reviews this product had, I ordered it. Installing the batteries was a bit challenging since the earcups don't come of easily. After wearing them on the range, had to take it off several times as it does not feel comfortable for long wear. The sound had a slight delay, but that's ok for me though....Overall, it would be nice if the cushions were more comfortable..",3.0

I used them twice, each with a 'popping' or 'static noise' occuring every few seconds, which got worse over time even with new batteries (ding 1st star). I returned them & considering a better set of Peltor... but REALLY like the compact nature of these - decisions, decisions. Interesting note: Each time I took them apart after use, the internal components were quite damp from normal perspiration. This may have been the cause of increasing static/popping, but should have design components to address this (ding 2nd star)... If you buy these, I'd suggest letting them fully air out after use in the heat.",3.0
"At first I was excited about using these ear muffs for shooting, but various annoyances with the Peltor 97044 started to creep into the picture.  For one, the sound reduction rating (19 dBA) was decent but also wasn't great. The ability to change from top of the head to back of the head was not an option, but I could live without that.  However, once I figured out that installing/replacing the batteries were going to be a chore every time, I had to send the Peltor 97044 back because following the directions to install the batteries was not initially intuitive and proved to be a bit more challenging than I would like for changing them out on a firing range.  Add to this was this ear muff was to be interchangeable for my wife and my own use.  If she wasn't capable or comfortable with changing out the batteries easily on her own without tools, they had to go back.  On the plus side, I did like the ability of the ear cups to pick up and amplify noise independently for ease of directional understanding of where a noise/voice came from.  The fit was comfortable and seemed to be reasonably easy to adjust between my wife and my head sizes.  Also, the profile (the ear cup size) was small, easily fit next to a rifle butt and did not feel like you were wearing lead bricks on your head when you bent over to pick something up like the old style noise canceling ear muffs did.  However, in the end, we went with Howard Leight R-01526 for its better sound reduction rating (22 dBA), ease of battery change out and the ability to connect to an external sound source.",3.0
"The Peltor Tactical is a very good hearing protector.  My only problem was figuring out the instructions for opening ear parts to insert (and remove) the batteries.

They mention that the pads wear out in 6 months, which I thought odd because I have muffs a lot older than 6 months that I never replaced anything on. The interior foam will wear out on these for sure, do to the fact that they make contact with your ears. This is what makes them hot and uncomfortable for long term wear (3-4 hours). Not to mention your glasses ""must"" have wire frames or the muff becomes useless, there is no extra room in the cup for the arms of your eye wear.",3.0

"I absolutely would not use this compass in my personal outdoors activities.

However, i don't believe it's intended by Brunton for ""serious, reliable, no-fail"" use. It's a ~$12 compass. If you're shopping for a compass you can reply on in all conditions, prepare to spend a bit more for something a little more robust. In the Brunton line-up, the 15TDCL is a good choice and the minimum i'd personally choose.

What I do like and use this compass for is to teach Basic Direction Finding and Land Navigation in conjunction with it's companion Brunton 9020G ""Instruction Compass"". This is an excellent pair for both the initial classroom work and then in-the-field applications (in my Basic Course, i use well-bordered areas to avoid loosing students).  I've looked at/used many different compasses over the years and for my classes and students there is no better choice currently available, but it's not perfect either.

Here's what i REALLY like about this compass and why i'd buy more:
1) the degrees/headings/bearings are very well marked out
2) the ""Directional Pointers"" are large and easy to see/use
3) the compass is small enough to fit in everyones hand easily, but not too small for folks with big hands
4) the compass needle is well-dampened and the capsules (i have 12 of these) are free of air-bubbles
5) the baseplate is marked with both US/Imperial and Metric scales
6) the baseplate has a handy lanyard loop molded right into it's shape - very well thought out!!!
7) the baseplate is a very convenient/hi-visibility translucent green so if somehow it gets dropped it's easy to relocate
8) the compass DOES HAVE a declination adjustment
9) the price - it's very affordable and does the basic work of a compass very well

What i *DON'T* like - essentially the actual degree/headings/bearings ring - POTENTIAL EPIC FAIL AND DANGEROUS - DO NOT USE THIS COMPASS AS YOUR ONLY WILDERNESS COMPASS

1) the degree/headings/bearings ring is cheap, easily scuffed paper-type of material simply pressed into the bezel - i need to come up with a way to protect these markings otherwise epic fail
2) the degree/headings/bearings ring can fall out of the bezel - i need to come up with a way to prevent this from happening - otherwise epic fail

As my class sizes grow i may buy a few more of these, but i try not to let classes get too large. With this compass, the benefits far outweigh the compromises, but the degree/headings/bearings ring shortfall really needs to be addressed.

Again, I wouldn't use this compass in my personal outdoors activities because of the degree/headings/bearings ring. However, it's great for what i do use it for - teaching basic compass use.

EDIT: 26June2010 - I've attempted a ""fix"" to the degree/headings/bearings ring using clear finger nail polish to 1) seal and 2) adhere the ring in place. I anticipate success with this, but classes have been in fair-weather conditions thus far.",3.0
I just bought it to give my son a sense of how to use a compass while geo-caching and it was serviceable for that.  You don't want to give a 10 year old something you really value afterall.,3.0
"hi all
got Brunton Classic Compass a few months back.
a very decent basic compass for hiking and orienteering,...
the dial is clear, the needle stabilizes fast.
Only two things bothered me..i had a few friends having a Silva Polaris Base Plate Compass. right at where i need to read my heading ((((the directional arrow coinciding with the azimuth degrees on the rotating dial...they have a small white mark --- an extension of the directional arrow (index pointer) ...just below the transparent dial).)))
So if you want to head 140 degrees ON  Brunton Classic Compass .you have to keep an eye on the dial and try to line it up to the directional arrow... you will face the same problem WHEN NOT having a sighting and signaling mirror....
if you want to Silva Polaris Base Plate Compass-- the small white mark just below the rotating dial will help you to keep your eye right on the degrees and to stop at 140 degrees the moment it coincides with the directional arrow
the other thing is : declination adjustment. i have to do it every time with Brunton Classic Compass....i did not see any adjustable declination. the product feature in amazon said ..adjustable declination.
i did not or could not locate any feature like that nor any  screw driver type instrument to adjust for declination. i have to do the math in my head everything i wanted to go...i am a statistician and this did not bother me...but the product description on amazon should be changed",3.0
"This `easy-to-read' compass is perfect for map and compass orienteering.  It has a tool free adjustable declination for easy navigating and gives you graduations in degrees.  The scale is in both inches and millimeters and the clear plastic makes for easy use on any map.  Unfortunately, there is no site-mirror, which makes for a more accurate reading.  It's small size and price (under $10!) makes for a simple, efficient compass when backpacking or hiking.  It's a good beginner compass, but remember that you get what you pay for. For a little more money you can get a nice ""Lensatic"" military compass with a sighting-arm.",3.0
"Some of the reviews I read sounded like they were written by people who had little real wilderness experience.  A compass like this one is exactly what Boy Scouts learn to navigate with.  Contrary to one review, this compass does have a declination adjustment.  It is a bottom plate with an alignment arrow that turns independent of the top.  So, in my case, I set the alignment arrow so that it is +19 degrees off of of zero (N).  Now all I have to do is align the magnetic needle with the off set arrow and the compass readings all read true.  There are several types of compasses.  This is what I call ""Type A"". A magnetic needle operates independently of the compass card.  It is the most popular type. You should read a book or on line to figure out how to do a few simple things like orienting the compass and taking a bearing, and understanding declination. My only complaint on this compass is that after rattling around in my pack for a few years the letters and numbers on the base plate almost wore off.  Perhaps you should purchase a case for your compass.  I helped teach a mountaineering class yesterday and this is the type of compass is what everybody used.  4 teams bushwhacked through steep terrain following a compass heading for over a mile and all (independently) came out within 100 to 150 feet of their destination. Conclusion: this type compass is good for woods navigation, a site mirror or a lensatic type is not needed.

I gave it only 3 stars because there are so many brands that are similar I can't say it is better than average, except it looks pretty cool with the colored base, and is easy to read.",3.0
"The Brunton Classic is a straightforward, easy-to-use, low-cost compass that works well in the outdoors.  It is a bit clunky-looking and a little bulky in your pocket, but you will appreciate that fact in cold weather when you are wearing gloves.  It comes with a TRUE declination adjustment that moves the north reference indicator to the desired declination.  This is much better than some of the least expensive compasses that claim to have a declination adjustment but really don't.  (They require you to manually offset the needle from the north reference indicator to achieve it, something you don't want to have to struggle with when you are exhausted after hiking for 10 hours.)  The Brunton doesn't need a tool to adjust declination, which they claim as an advantage.  In contrast, Suunto compasses use a tiny screwdriver attached to the lanyard to make the adjustment.  Personally, I like the screwdriver adjustment as being more accurate and less likely to be accidentally moved, but they both work equally well.  The bearing markings silkscreened onto the Brunton's dial are not as fine-ruled as the Suunto so you can't get quite as precise a readout, but the difference is insignificant in most cases.

One thing I don't particularly like about the Brunton is that the baseplate is symmetric, so if you're not careful you can end up reading a bearing that is 180 degrees off from what you intended.  On the Suunto, on the other hand, one edge of the baseplate is shaped like an arrow, so it is always obvious which way to point it.

This basic compass doesn't have a sighting mirror, and there are decidedly two schools of thought on whether this is necessary.  Some people absolutely claim you need a mirror compass for accurate navigation.  Others do perfectly fine without it.  I've used both and find the simple compass works just fine for all but the most exacting requirements.  The reality is that you can't follow a bearing in the field over real terrain to better than 5-10 degrees anyway, so reading bearings to 1-2 degrees is overkill.  Smart navigators always use the concept of ""aiming off"" to compensate for their inability to navigate that accurately (check any good map and compass book for an explanation).  The Brunton works well for trail hikers and moderate cross-country work.  It is also a good choice to use with a GPS receiver or as a backup compass.  For people who are creating trail maps or doing survey work, a mirror compass is a better choice, in which case you might consider going with the absolute best, the Brunton Pocket Transit.  But at a price of $250-300, it's not going to compete with the under $10 Brunton Classic.",3.0
"I previously bought an expensive folding compass that was attractive, sturdy and well-made.  Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to use it!  This little compass is easy to use, fits in your pocket, and has a nice price. But--fast forward a year--for some reason, it no longer works. Strangely, the directions are now wrong (North is now South). I don't know if I somehow demagnetized it, but my recommendation is to spend a bit more on a better-made compass.",3.0
"My boys were very excited to get in their goal post and wanted to try it out.  However, we were missing a part and now can't even put it together....I sure hope we can get the part soon so they can enjoy playing with it.",3.0
"Bought this for Christmas for two grandsons aged 7 and 4. Wasn't sturdy enough to stay put together. I see it in their garage in pieces, haven't seen them use it since that Christmas day.",3.0
Was just some PVC pipe with connectors. Didn't even come in a box. The parts were loose in the brown shipping box. Son liked it though.,3.0
"This product did not glow for very long. It also has a problem holding air. I can't really recommend it. If you can go charge it up every couple of minutes, you get glow, but it fades fast.",3.0
"The glow doesn't last that long in the dark and is a bit disappointing after reading the rave reviews about it. If it wasn't from Santa, I would've returned it.",3.0
"I cannot attest to the working quality of the ball, I returned it because it looked cheap and did not light up from the inside like I wanted.",3.0
"its a nice football.  Nothing special, doesnt glow extra bright or anything, but it's nice to have for kids with smaller hands",3.0
"Not as bright as we hoped. Cheaper than led. And be careful, distance is hard to judge in the dark. not easy to catch. Now I wish I had spent the money on the led.",3.0
"The only problem I have with this item is that the finger grips started ripping off after the first 5 throws. My son loves the fact that it glows so instead of returning, I super-glued the grip down. So far so good.",3.0
"this football arrived super quick and is just what my little bro asked for this christmas. i was initially impressed with the ball but upon further inspection it looks very sloppily assembled, there is white bonding-like material just dripping down from where it should have been NEATLY applied along the center of the ball. it won't come off and i'm slightly embarrased to give this as a gift but hoping it will  be overlooked since there's not enough time to return it by christmas. otherwise it looks functional and something my brother will enjoy.",3.0
"This ball is not the junior size I was looking for, too big for my 7 year old's hands.  Nice football, nice grip, nice everything except the junior size is misleading I thought it would be smaller.",3.0
"This ball was OK, nothing special. It handles a bit awkwardly, not having quite enough bounce to it. It also has a tendency to lose air a little. Maybe mine was defective or something but I had to re-pump it once ever 3-4 days. The glow worked really good at the beginning, you could see it from blocks away. It faded over a couple of months though, maybe I left it in the light too long.
Also, if you're planning to play outdoors and you have a problem with your court being dusty then this ball is not for you. If it gets dirty then it covers the glow and you're better off getting some sort of a light if possible.
Overall I think this ball is OK for shooting around or having a fun pick up game, but I wouldn't use it to practice dribbling or playing an actual competitive game.",3.0
"good buy. does not come in a package (like cardboard backing that it is attached too or a box), only plastic wrapped. good buy though",3.0
"I wanted to love this basketball, I really did, but it just didn't have that glow that I was hoping for. I know, I know, it doesn't have an internal light, so I shouldn't have expected much, but generally speaking, we typically only play basketball during the day, and by the time we think we might want to use it at night, it has been setting in the dark garage without a light source for so long, that there is no glow for nighttime play. I also feel this ball has deflated quicker than other basketballs that I have purchased from the big box stores. I would not recommend this product, even as a novelty.",3.0
"Being a spherical object, it's hard to get both sides glowing equally,but it is bright and worked great as a ""bowling ball"" for glow in the dark bowling.",3.0
This ball is a little dimmer than I would have liked. We held it directly over a light bulb and it still seemed dim. I would find another ball.,3.0
"Got this for my little brother for Christmas... Was a bit dissapointed that it only came in 28.5, but it wasn't too expensive so that shouldn't be too much of a problem. It glows bright but doesn't last as long as i hoped it would... But overall i think it'll be really fun for us all to use at night.",3.0
Got this basketball for my grandson for Christmas.  He seems happy with it. Will get to use it when the weather breaks.,3.0
"Received one of the balls in very poor condition. However, vendor did replace within 3 days.",3.0
"The product is great, but the price of these balls is definitely ridiculous.  It's a baseball in a plastic case - not a Tiffany ring.",3.0
Not a good value at all,3.0
"The Rawlings and MLB logo was slightly off-centered, so I can imagine someone buying this strictly for autographs might be annoyed. I'm more annoyed at the fact that as I'm writing this the ball is $3 cheaper than what I paid...",3.0
"The baseballs themselves are great, but the picture of a ball cube display case was a bit misleading since the balls came wrapped in paper in boxes rather than in display cubes.  Not a huge deal, but a little bit more pricy than I would have liked since I thought I was getting a ball cube in addition to the ball for that price.",3.0
"Some of these balls are perfect. Some have smudges, or the printing is not centered. I bought two for autograph. One came perfect, and the other one had a small red ink smudge on it and the printing was not centered perfect. So be careful, it seems to be a gamble if you will get a good ball or one that is slightly off. I will use the bad one to play catch with.(still a good ball though. you get what you pay for)",3.0
"Was a gift for my Son in law, baseball fan goes to the spring trainings and gets autographs, these came in acrylic cases and both were cracked. Didn't plan on using them anyway",3.0
"I didn't buy this to play ball with, just to hold in my hand while watching games on tv.

It is crappy - the shape of the yarn threads are visible through the leather casing.  Never seen that on any ball before, and boy is it tacky.  On the other hand it IS a baseball, an OFFICIAL baseball at that, so it comes with enough beautiful design, aura, and authenticity to get a minimum of three stars.

The stupid writing and logoing started to wear off almost immediately - can't wait till they are gone altogether.",3.0
"I just checked the Walmart website, and I saw each ball for $11.76 at limited locations.",3.0
"The ball says Official Major League Baseball and has Selig's signature on it, but arrived with the blue ""batter logo"" smudged onto the
white cowhide, and a small indentation crease on one side.  I bought it just to hold as a stress reducer during the day, but not sure if
the ink is going to lift now.

Is this now normal, or should I return it for another one?

I don't remember a ball ever smudging when I played in high school, and they still play in the rain.",3.0
kind of flimsy. Bends way too much. Probably okay for a smooth hill. The pull rope broke the first day. The finish on the bottom was rough and needed waxed in order for it to go well down the hill.,3.0
Doesn't glow. Buy it if you want an okay soccer ball. DONT buy it if you want a glow one. Doesn't flow. At all. Ever.,3.0
does not glow very much,3.0
"The ball is fine, but don't expect what you see in the pic.",3.0
Great,3.0
"Haven't yet seen it glow in the night/dark yet.  Not sure if we're not in the sun long enough, so it's really hard to say if it works or not.  But as a soccer ball, it's fine.",3.0
"It is a neat ball, color wise.  My son plays with it on occasion but it is not his favorite.  He thought it was a little harder than his regulation ball.",3.0
The stitching started falling apart after a few months.,3.0
good size - doesn't glow that bright,3.0
Started to crack and the seams are coming apart.,3.0
Product OK,3.0
"The ball is not as shown in the image as of today's date, when I received mine. It is neon pink, an extremely bright pink, flat color with no sheen. By no stretch of the imagination could screen differences account for the variation; it is an entirely different pink, about as far away on the color spectrum as it could be and still be pink. The green pentagons are continuous around the middle of the ball, rather than distributed throughout as shown in the image. One review stated a hand pump was included. Not an issue for us, but, for those for whom this might make a difference, there is no hand pump. The ball does come inflated. It will probably be more visible than the original, but our reason for selecting this particular ball over others was mainly the color. Generally the items we receive through Amazon are quite true to the colors we see online, so this is a bit of a disappointment. Can't speak to durability, but will update the review if this proves to be an issue for us, as it has been for others.",3.0
"I don't know if I got a dud or what but, in order for this thing to work for even a few seconds,  I need to hold it up to a very bright light of some sort for over a minute. By the time I get  one section of the ball to glow a little tiny bit and move to another section, the first section isn't glowing at all. Def a pain in the arse and well below expectation!",3.0
We use these for P90X and they work well. Only criticism is I wish the bands themselves were labeled with their weight. It can be frustrating to keep checking the users guide for weights when you're trying to keep up pace. I'll probably just mark them myself.,4.0
"Missing, information on the accessories...what are they and how are they to be used? Hopefully this information is on their website. Check it out.
Use of the Bands and door stop are well cover, all else is missing.",4.0
good product,4.0
My wife gave me this as a present. We were shuttling between home and our beach house and were neglecting our workouts. This starting kit is so versatile and easily adjustable that we both can use them  alternatively and we both get our workouts! They are easy to care for and transportable so we can use them at home and cottage. It has improved our fitness dramatically.,4.0
I bought these bands to use with the p90x workout program. I would have given them 5 stars except for one issue- my red band began to fray after about a month of 6 days a week use. Otherwise they're great.,4.0
"Length is versatile, appears well made.  I have not yet had it long enough to talk about durability.  The carry bag is very useful.  I would buy again.",4.0
Great set to carry with you on the road. Can't wait to try this soon.,4.0
"This product makes it easier for me to workout at home, me and my best friend use them everyday and the change is coming !!! Love it!",4.0
"I bought these for use with the P90 program. The red band in this set seems more firm than the one that comes with the P90 kit. It may be because it is slightly shorter. Either way, I actually like the red one in this set better. Having the ability to combine bands so easily is a big plus.

The one downside to these is the same reason I like them. The clip used for adding bands can rub on your arms if you are using it under your foot and then raise your arms above your head. The whole connection area is bulky and can be irritating. I still recommend this set and would buy again.",4.0
"The bands seem to be well made and will hopefully last a long time with daily use.
The set is also a good value. A comparable set of only 3 bands from Costco was the same price.
One minor complaint is that the clips on the end of the bands don't  always easily engage the rings on the end of the end of the handles making it difficult to quickly change bands when exercising.and going from one movement to another.",4.0
Good product. It arrived on time and as it shows in the photo. The booklet is information on the bands and exercises you can do with them. One of the clips on the bands was starting to rust. I wasn't happy with that but the rest of the clips were fine.,4.0
I really like this set and it packs well in luggage. I just wish I had the discipline to use them as often as I should!,4.0
Bands are good. However it gives me the feeling of being a little weak. It might be just my impression. Handles are very good and the clipping system works as it should. There is enough resistance to have a controlled workout or a heavy one.,4.0
"Works well. Great value compared to individual bands. Fast and easy to configure different resistance levels. Only improvement I would recommend is some type of sleeve that would ""secure"" the bands together, but not a major issue.",4.0
Love them so far my only complaint is that there is only one set of handles so you have to switch it between bands and two people can't work out at the same time with them.,4.0
"The resistance band set, works as expected.  The design and graduated resistance allows for an infinite variety of exercises.",4.0
"I bought this early in 2014 but have just started really using it as I was busy with other stuff. Anyway, I give this 5 stars for product itself, but I am giving 4 stars overall because of incomplete product description / safety guidelines. For example, an ankle strap is included but not identified in the user manual or shown being used in the included guide. It is obvious to me what it is and how to use it, but that really isn't the point. It should be identified and and at least one picture showing it being used. Another point is the proper position of the quick clips (Carabiners) connecting the bands to the handles. There is no description given in the user guide that shows this. The photo on Amazon shows the strap from the tube placed in the small end. I find that there is so much material that the strap won't go all the way in. I place the strap in the wide end with the small end in the ""D"" ring on the handle. Otherwise the carabiner is cockeyed. Maybe it doesn't matter but I think this too should be shown in the user guide. My other negative is that there no FAQ section on Back Mountain's site that could answer some of these issues as well as other questions without having to send the company emails.
Now on to the positives. I like these bands and the fact that it is easy to combine bands for the exercise you are doing. They are don't take up much space and can be set up and taken down easily (We have a small house and I don't have room for much exercise equipment). Being 66 I can adjust the amount of resistance that is suitable for me and there is minimal stress as with free weights which I also use. It is easy to make finer adjustments than you can with weights. I do not use them in a door however. I have a place where I can attach them that is more suitable for me.
Maybe a new manual has already addressed the issues I laid out above, otherwise I hope that  Black Mountain reads this and issues a new one to add more needed information.",4.0
This a great set of bands. I really like the ability to swap in and out different bands to create the ideal tension I'm looking for. The quality of the bands and the handle feel great! All said these bands are a great value for the money.,4.0
Perfectly as described,4.0
"These bands are great for a variety of exercise programs, such as P90X or some of the exercise programs on XBox One. This is my first experience with exercise bands, so I am still learning how to use them properly.

I am slightly bothered by the connection between the handle and the band. It can be uncomfortable if you are doing an exercise that causes it to rub against you. Like I said, this is probably a result of my own inexperience.

These bands are very well made and have enough variety for a wide range of users. The kit also come with some clever attachments for connecting them to doorways for pull-ups.",4.0
These bands fit the bill for basic resistance training.  Economical package versus buying items individually.,4.0
"Thus, far the BMP Resistance Band set is working great.  I have only had them for about a month, but so far there have been no major issues.  The bands being adjustable is very convenient.  If I were obligated to give something they could improve on, it would be that the strap in the handle slides a little occasionally.  However, this is very minor and I do not see any other way which they could be designed.  Additionally, there is an option to receive a free orange band if you call in.",4.0
Only used for about a week but so far it seems good quality and very useful for at home use.  Only gave four stars as I will update later to see how well they maintain their strength.,4.0
"Not bad.  I have a bum shoulder and a bad knee, and these help me exercise them when weights are too stressful",4.0
got a good buy on them. on time deliver,4.0
"This product is a good, inexpensive alternative to buying a dumbbell set... Obviously it can't replace dumbbells completely, but it's a good alternative. I love that Black Mountain Products is an American small business. My wife and I are using these at the house, in our small, office/gym; their compact design is a big plus for us.",4.0
"These resistance bands work well, come in a handy carry bag, and have well built attachments. Good Purchase.",4.0
Good quality product. Have been using for about a year now so bought a set for a family member. Everything you need for a complete workout.,4.0
Durable product with adjustable resistance and product arrived fast.,4.0
It does what it says,4.0
"They work well and are easy to use, a bit annoyed I have to call for the orange one so they lose a star for that!",4.0
"We have been very happy with this product, using it for P90X workouts at home.  The quality is very good relative to other similar products we have seen, particularly in the stability and manufacturing in the carabiners that attach the bands to the handles.  Less expensive varieties often use very thin metal here to save cost at the expense of durability and function.  This sets also contains more bands than less expensive sets, including a black band for maximum resistance.

The only thing that could be improved would be the addition of one of those foam donuts on a strap that lets you fix the straps to a doorframe by wedging it between the door and the doorjamb.  Fortunately we had one of these from a previous pack of bands so it wasn't a problem, but if we hadn't had that we would have been out of luck for this type of exercise.",4.0
good product,4.0
"Good quality, safe and well made. After three workouts, I can see that I will need to get the additional heavier bands. At 66 years, I was looking for muscle tone without injury, and I believe that I have found it. Much easier to break in to an exercise routine that is gradually stronger with little or no soreness if you are careful.",4.0
Very Nice. My one complaint is the handles wear out quickly.,4.0
good price,4.0
"These are good quality.  I use the heaviest band a lot.  It's sort of a pain to switch bands, since there's only one pair of handles.  I tend to just leave the heaviest band connected.",4.0
"The bands themselves are really nice. The ankle strap and door strap are nice good quality. The only reason this product didn't get 5 stars is that only having one set of handles makes working out with videos like p90x a little more frustrating. I don't use the same weight for every excersie during the hour work out so I have to constantly he pausing my video to switch the handles. Other than that, great product.",4.0
"These are good workout bands for at home. I use them with P90X. The only thing I do not like is the handle is made of a rough fabric that scratches my wrist/forearm area if I do any workouts when I have to reach over my head, therefore I wear long sleeves. Other than that, I recommend.",4.0
I bough these resistance bands for Christmas and he loves them.  He liked that they came with come many different bands at such a great cost.  Great for working out at home.,4.0
Replacing a similar product.  Seems to work well.,4.0
"I bought these for my husband for his birthday. He really likes them and has already had a few great work outs. It is nice that there are a variety of bands so my husband (who lifts a lot) and I (weakling) can both use them. You do need a lot of space to use it in your doorway which is difficult in our small apartment. It also takes a couple minutes between exercises to switch bands and get ready for the next exercise, but this will get faster with more use.",4.0
Item was as expected.  Would purchase again,4.0
I bought these bands a couple weeks ago and so far they appear to be very well made.  I really like the metal clamps that allow me to connect multiple bands together to increase resistance.  They also come in a nice little travel bag to take with you anywhere you plan to work out.  I think these are a great deal for the price.,4.0
Great addition to your daily workout routine.,4.0
the bands are ok,4.0
Hell of a quick power work out. Just make sure you mount it correctly! Ouch! !!!!,4.0
"Great product, but I am kind of terrified by how small the piece is that gets wedged in the door.  I can't help but flinch every time I use this because I feel like it's going to snap through the door jam and into my face.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend.",4.0
"I especially like the portability of this product, very useful if you travel.

I would not take the lifetime warranty seriously since is it subject to change at any time, and I suppose anything that stretches will weaken with time, but at this price, if it lasts a few years, I will be satisfied",4.0
Very good product,4.0
great product,4.0
"This has worked pretty much as I expected. I would say the main criticisms I have are not with the quality per se, just the nature of the product. I.e. the way the bands have to rub on your arms depending on what exercise is being done. Nothing a T-Shirt can't take care of. And the method of attaching to a door frame is not the best, but part of the issue is the layout of the doors in my apartment. You need a door where you can stretch straight out from the door.",4.0
"For $30 this is a pretty comprehensive, well made set of bands and accessories to make them useful.  However, for my purposes I found the strongest band barely strong enough to get any benefit from exercising with it.  The other bands will never be used unless I find some alternative exercises that require less resistance.  This isn't a complaint about the product, it has more to do with an individual's needs.",4.0
Good quality.,4.0
"I use them daily and have had no problems,  they are just what was expect.",4.0
Well made and easy to adjust resistance bands. 5 bands of varying resistance with quick connect clips make it easy to adjust resistance on the fly. I use the included door jam adapter to hold all the bands and then clip and in unclip as needed. The construction is high quality. The only piece that gives me a slight concern are the handles which are made of plastic. They work fine for the resistance levels I use but I would worry about them cracking under severe resistance.,4.0
"So far, these work fine and are a good price considering the assortment you get.",4.0
Great equipment but having to attach and reattach the different straps is quite a hassle when you switch between workouts.,4.0
good resistance haven't had any problems,4.0
"great value, great performance",4.0
"Seems to work well, good tension, depending on your hand position and how many bands you have connected to the ring at the handle all the connectors can get in the way, but seems to be a good product, the door anchor is clever, I was skeptical about how strong it would be, but it holds its own.",4.0
"Great product, very durable.",4.0
"Really high-quality, well-thought-out set with tough connectors and an excellent door anchor.  For my purposes, the door anchor makes all the difference and I hardly use the bands without it. My one complaint is that the handle straps are a bit rough when they scrape against your body and can rub you raw with certain exercises like overhead press.",4.0
These seem to be good quality with lots of adjustment. Very well priced,4.0
"A good set of resistance bands, very comfortable to use.",4.0
"Great starter kit. A little bit flimsly but works well for me. I keep a band in my office and do quick workouts between meetings, very convenient. I'm not sure how well these would hold up for hard-core users though.",4.0
great for your arms to get toned and sweat heavy.,4.0
Good set of resistance bands to have. The different resistances make it great for anyone to use.,4.0
good value,4.0
"Some background:
I have owned these bands for 6 months now and use them frequently, probably twice a week on average, but often three times.  I am not easy on equipment, when I buy something, I want it to hold up under stress.  These bands are, for me, used almost exclusively for high intensity interval training workouts (HIIT).  I use the Jungle Gym XT in conjunction with the bands for 4 sets of 10 different exercises at 45 seconds per exercise, 4 or 5 of which are done with the bands.  For many of the exercises, I stand on the middle of the bands with shoes on, but almost always on a thick yoga mat (Manduka - if you know this mat, you know its a lot of padding), but also use the door anchor.  I have never used the ankle thing.

Verdict - the good:
These are absolutely indispensable for me.  I work onsite in a trailer and have no other way to do resistance training other than body weight.  I can usually get enough resistance/proper resistance out of a combination of the bands for workouts that use high reps.  The handles are comfortable and so far the nylon seems durable.  There are a multitude of exercises that can be done with the bands, so variety is high.

  - the bad:
Most of the bands that I have used over the last 6 months show some sign of slight tearing.  Not enough for me to say, ""Holy crap, this baby is going to blow,"" but enough to make me concerned.  I think this is mostly from standing on them, however, the black and red I usually use in the door anchor, and they are showing some very small tears as well.  The longevity of these is questionable, but I guess I don't know what their life expectancy is supposed to be.  One thing that I absolutely hate: the little clasps (metal quick connectors) at the ends of the bands.  When I'm doing my workouts, I have 15 seconds in between exercises.  It's difficult to swap out bands because, over time, these carabiners start to stick, and many of mine are showing signs of corrosion.  They also do not offer much in the way of clearance to get the rings of the handles through them; also, the nylon rides up the side of the clasp, making them more difficult to open, because the bottom is just too narrow to contain it.

All in all, I'd say for the money these are worth it, but I think Black Mountain could get a more durable rubber compound, and put a better quality clasp on them.",4.0
Love the product and works great! Shipment came in good time.,4.0
Wish they can give an extra pair of handles.  Switching from band and band is nice but when you have to swap out the handles when you switch the bands... boo.  The price for the product is great... maybe add an extra dollar or two to include the extra handle?,4.0
This strap combo is great very good quality and I'm sure we will get hours of use out of it. Thanks,4.0
"The wife did not like them, they rubbed up against her sensitive skin and left her bruises.  I use them without problem.",4.0
"So far, so good. The quality seems to be pretty good, and the bands are warrantied for life. It comes in a handy little carry bag, so you can take it other places if necessary. There was an earlier video review with a broken clip, and the latest version uses metal carabiners instead, which seem to be very durable, and I can't imagine they'd break.

The usage is pretty straightforward, and there's a little pamphlet inside with instructions and photos of how to do certain exercises. The only caveat I would give (which is stated in the instructions) is to *only* use it on solid doors. The door jamb attachment isn't that big, so if you have a door with loose hinges, or big gaps, you could potentially hurt yourself. I would definitely not use it on a pressed wood door.

All in all, great product. Thanks.",4.0
recieved promply and works great thanks...CF,4.0
"Its a pretty standard set. Delivery was quick, does what I intended it to do.",4.0
"These are a great value. I'm really impressed with the quality of the bands and the carabiners. The storage bag is a nice touch. My only issue is the ankle band has the rough velcro facing inwards instead of outwards, making it a bit uncomfortable to use. Other than that the bands themselves are top notch.",4.0
"This product is exactly as advertised.  It contains more bands than I need, but using just one of the bands every day has done a great deal to improve my upper body strength.",4.0
"I'm a relatively fit 20something, but I spend a horrifying amount of time in front of computers or books, and like to periodically get up and exercise to break that up and mitigate the health effects.  This set dramatically expands the repertoire of fast, quiet exercises I can just get up and do.  The bands and fixtures all appear to be well made and have held up to their first month of use, the hardware is top-notch, and the set makes a nice, light, compact, self-contained package.  My only criticisms are that a few of the lightest bands are light enough to be not very useful, and several of the suggested exercises require a door with a lot of clearance around it to use as an anchor, which is not an option in all locations.",4.0
These bands are great.  Used them during my P90X workouts.  They are durable and very easy to use.  Love the storage back to keep them all in.,4.0
Very good exercise tool especially on the road when you can't get to the gym.  Durable and lightweight.,4.0
"Seems to be very well made. If you write a review, they send you free stuff. I've only had it less than a week, and no significant results so far...",4.0
"The good: The products are well made and have held up to continuous use over a 4 year period. The equipment comes with a handy user guide and shows you a wide array of strength training tecniques which takes the guess work out of working out!

I've struggled over the years with regular gym activity, but this bag of bands makes it so easy. My favorite exercise is the seated low row. This is achieved by hooking the strap bands to my couch and performing a row on the floor.

The bad: This product is great for toning arms, back, legs, but lacks ability to tone the back. The product also comes with black straps which irritate my skin due to the sandpaper-like nature of the material.

Summary: The product is great for days you just can't make it to the gym. The product is geared towards beginners and can be confusing at first, but the workout guide makes it fun and entertaining. Just be careful not to let the bands snap back and hit you, it will sting!",4.0
"sturdy rubber, good grips, neat little book with added tips.",4.0
Had these bands for a couple of weeks now to use for PT on my low back. They work great and seem to be of good quality. I would recommend.,4.0
"very good excersice,warm up.",4.0
"I take this with me on trips and to work so when I have a minute I can do some exercise. My complaint is that the cords get dirty doing the exercise if you are standing on them. Then if you touch them to your clothes, your clothes are dirty.

Perhaps another device to hold the cords on the floor without standing on the cords themselves would be a good addition.",4.0
Great product....simple to use and effective.  Wish it had 2 more handles...but otherwise this thing gonna get me in shape...!!!!,4.0
Nice set for warming up before weightlifting.,4.0
"Nice and solid product - training is fun and the product allows you to take your gym on the road.
only thing i don't like about it is that you always have to lookup which colour matches which weight - a bit more intuitive colours
would've been helpful - but that's really just a minor problem.",4.0
Been using these for about a week and seem to be going great. Band look like they will last a while.,4.0
"For the price, I think they are pretty good. If they were more expensive I would be giving them 2 or 3 stars, but since they are a budget product, I think some amount of quality issues can be expected. After one month of daily use I started to notice some minor damage to the cords, but they still work fine. I haven't been using them lately, but with daily use I wouldn't expect them to last for years. It wouldn't surprise me if they started to be too damaged to use within 6-12 months, but that's speculation.

You should buy this knowing they won't last forever. They are basically a disposable product. That said, I think they are great for the price and I would definitely recommend them to someone wanting to try resistance bands. If I were running a gym, I probably wouldn't buy these.",4.0
So far works perfect.,4.0
"Good quality resistance bands. Love the removable handles which also increase the versatility by allowing you to mix multiple bands together. Really like the strap so you can anchor the bands and increase the number of exercises you can do. Even my ""I don't like to exercise"" husband likes these. Wish the instruction guide were a bit better. It would be nice if there was a way to print the resistance level on the bands (near the handles not in the middle where stepping on them would cause the print to wear off). I know the book tells you what resistance they are supposed to be and in theory you can remember but guess what I can't and I have to go back and look it up all of the time.",4.0
Can't say I know how to hook it up to a door. Instructions would have been nice. But they strap to the bed frame just as easy I guess. Good product.,4.0
"Originally I didn't like these much. The bands were shorter than I am used to and at 6'1"" doing an overhead press wasn't going to happen. Which is why I bought them to begin with because I kept breaking the walmart extra heavy long golds gym band. I was breaking 1 a week doing the exercises they had on their sheet the way it was shown.

So I bought these and promptly figured out overhead press while standing was a no go. But, but, if I had the three heaviest bands on and hooked the bands back around my ankles while on my toes and knees (kneeling) I was back in business. I used some knee pads and high laced hiking boots (so the bands wouldn't dig into my ankles). A little awkward but it works great for the shoulder exercises and back of arms. Most people wouldn't like this but it actually works out great for me since I'm using an RV to take a job out of state. Overhead workouts were not going to go over well anyway, lol. Plus it's easy to stow these someplace out of the way while getting a good workout.",4.0
Perfect for my needs,4.0
GOOD PRODUCT.,4.0
"I purchased 2 of these sets to help supplement and adjust my current work out routine.  I've currently own a Marcy weight cage that has a dual pulley  system in the rear with attachments centered high and low.  My weight bench is a standard Marcy bench that does not allow for the attachment of a leg developer.  Prior to purchasing this set, I could do single arm flyes from the high position in various formats.  This is an acceptable way to accomplish this exercise if and only if you maintain even counts, form, and weight to avoid lop sided development.  This is a lot harder than it sounds.

With two of these resistance band sets, I am now able to attach bands to my upper right and left supports for true fly type exercises.  Because I purchased 2 sets, I now have 4 handles.  This turned out to be a blessing as it allowed me to loop one set of handles around the upper supports to keep the rubber from the bands from rubbing against any bolt ends or sharper metal edges, while still leaving two handles to perform the exercises.  Additionally, because I ordered two sets, I now have two ankle straps.  This allows me to attach the bands low under my weight bench, looped over the leg restraint foam rollers, and perform normal resistance leg development without the need to purchase a whole new bench.

I've added several new exercises to my routine as a result of this purchase.  The reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5:
I have a concern about potential wear on these bands.  I received them in what I would consider to be nearly pristine condition, but running my hands along the bands, I can feel slight nicks in the rubber.  This could be normal, but given how rubber bands work, this could be a future concern.  For now though, it is merely a thought that I check after each usage.  Another concern here is in their usage and not so much a testament to the product.  It must be understood that because these are essentially giant rubber bands, they attempt to snap back to original form.  Make sure to take proper, sturdy, stances when using these.

After much more time with them, I may upgrade them to a 5 star product.  That depends wholly on how they ""wear"" with daily usage.  I would definitely purchase these again and do highly recommend them for usage in your routine, whether it is light duty or heavy duty.",4.0
The bands are very durable. The door strap adds another dimension to my resistance workout..,4.0

I am very satisfied with this product. No complaints,4.0
Well-made resistance bands deserve a place in most people's workouts,4.0
"I bought these resistance bands to add light strength training to my work out routine.  I've been using them for a few months, and am very pleased so far.  The five different bands can be combined to create a wide range of resistances, and they come with a cuff to go around an arm or leg and a way to affix the band(s) you're using to a door, so I've been able to do a lot of different resistance band workouts this way.  The only workouts I haven't been able to do are those designed for wide, flat resistance bands--because these are tubular, I can not, for example, use them to point my toe against resistance.  It's also harder to stand on the band to use a shorter segment of it as resistance for bicep curls, as another example, because the band slips.

I've seen some people concerned about these bands holding up under repeated use or extensive stretching.  I am 5'9"" with fairly long arms, and I can stand on the center of the band, ends in my hands, and extend both arms fully above my head without worrying about breaking the bands.  Maybe another few months of use will break them, but I doubt it.

If you've particularly strong (you'd really have to be quite strong, though) or you have some reason to want to know very specifically how much resistance you're using, these might not be the bands for you.  I've found them to be very useful, though.",4.0
"I'm a short woman (5'1"") so no problem stretching them out all the way for me. I use the skinner bands for upper body work and the thicker ones for leg and core work. If you're tall though, you might find them too short, so others have said. So far, I haven't broken any and they have not stretched out much either. That's been the problem with other resistance bands I've bought in the past. Also, some others have been too long or they stretched out too quickly, so I had to wrap them around and around my hands to shorten them up, which I don't like. Some have been of such poor quality that they just didn't last. So far, I'm quite pleased with this set. I don't actually use the storage bag. so no comment on this.",4.0
better than expected,4.0
"This set of resistance bands feel very sturdy and gets the job done right. I am impressed with the quality of the buckles, clips and handles....great quality great price... Speedy delivery!!",4.0

Minus a star because the part to stick in a door didn't work to well and ended up smacking me in the back and leaving a big welt that hurt extremely bad for maybe a half hour.,4.0
Good product. One of the handles broke after 3 months of use but one quick call to customer service and they replaced it. Happy with customer service.,4.0
Very need. I use almost every day.,4.0
does the job,4.0
"I like it but I have to say I wish they included a way to ""loop"" the band over something to be able to do pull-down or back exercises. I ended up using the ""ankle"" attachment to do that and works for me. Quality is great and would definitely see this lasting me a long time. I love the carabineer because you can use 2 or more at the same time with the handles once you get stronger.",4.0
nice set arrived quickly,4.0
"Arrived swiftly and in good condition. So far, everything is still in tact. Very sturdy and well built. Would definitely recommend as it is very user-friendly.",4.0
Had the bands delivered two weeks ago the bands seem durable and the quality of the handles and the hardware are impressive for the price. Didn't give it five stars since the set is only two weeks old.,4.0
This product is good... Nice price... But not GREAT... It does the job... I had a previous set of these resistance bands and I can say that after a while (1 Year Or Less)... If you aren't careful with the bands... Some of them could break a lot before... So be careful... It's a good product if you know how to use them... I've bought a new set two weeks ago.,4.0
Bought these bands to use at home or when traveling when a gym is not accessible.  They are great quality and have not shown any signs of wear after one month of use. They are easy to travel with and you can perform many exercises with them. As far as price goes you can't beat them. Over all I am very pleased with my purchase.,4.0
It's a good product to work out at home buy it's not enough.  Good quality.  The shipping it was to much.,4.0
"I bought a set close to 3 years ago, and finally wore them out.  These new bands are even more reinforced, and I think I'll get just as much if not more use out these new ones.",4.0
I love these and have set them up in my small home gym.  I didn't want to invest in any weights or any expensive equipment and these were perfect. I use them with a few hitching rings I screwed into a support pole in the basement next to my treadmill. My only complaint is that they only come with one foot strap that isn't big enough to comfortably put both my feet in. I will be looking for another foot strap.,4.0
"I bought these to use for some of the P90X3 workouts that I wanted to do in my apartment vs. the gym.  I used them about one workout a week for 12 weeks.  They fit the bill perfectly.  I. Haven't noticed any rips or tears or faults in the bands at all.  I like that you can add multiple bands to the handles to increase the resistance.  Depending on the exercise, you do get the bands rubbing against bare skin and thus some discomfort or redness.  You can prepare for this by good technique and/or wearing longer sleeves/pants.  This problem would be inherent to all band products...it's just the nature of the product.  Admittedly, I haven't used them excessively, but so far I have no complaints and they are definitely better than a bunch of weights in my apartment for a workout or two a week.  If my opinion changes, I will update my review accordingly.  I normally don't do reviews, but the company is running a promo where you get another stronger band for free if you review- just to be up front.",4.0
"I enjoy my resistance bands. They pack up in the small travel bag so they are easy to take on the go. Easy to change tension quickly to ensure you get the workout you want to get. Been using them for about two months and still show no sign of wear and tear.

Lost a star because I feel the clips are installed backwards, and a few other technicalities that I feel would be easily made to make them perfect.",4.0
"These are very high quality, come in a convenient carry case and has thus far met all my expectations. A very good price too.",4.0
I bought these bands and they arrived here about a week ago. I have used them and they seem to work fine. My only complaint is that they are way too easy to stretch. I was expecting the heavier bands to have a little more resistance. They came in safe in the package however so that is good. Overall a pretty good product.,4.0
This is a gym in a bag. Highly effective strength training and very convenient. I use it at work during lunch.,4.0
"For the price, these simply can't be beat.  I purchased them for the p90x program.  I'm now on week 5 and they are still going strong.  My one comment on these would be that it can be a pain changing the bands.  Some of the clips can stick on the cloth straps.  However, this is more of a convenience issue than a problem with the product.  So, if you want an economical solution to bands, this is a great choice.",4.0
It's a good set and they're quite durable. Probably won't be enough to get someone into good shape but is good for toning or intense stretching.,4.0
Very nice band set for the novice or more advanced user.  The ability to add more resistance to match your needs is fantastic.  Only wished I purchased extra handles on day one to allow  multiple users or preset up configurations.,4.0
"I bought these originally to use in place of weights for various workout programs (such as p90x or p90x3), but I eventually just bought one of those adjustable dumbbell sets. Now I mostly use these as pullup assist bands. I like to attach at least two bands to the handles and throw them over my pullup bar so the handles are both hanging down and stick my foot into them. So far they haven't shown any signs of wearing despite what I'm sure is more weight then what they're meant for (I weigh 150lbs.)

As pullup assist bands, they work really well. I can already do more pullups after using them for a few weeks. As far as their normal intended function, they work just as good. I kind of wish there was an easier/faster way to switch the handles from band to band, but that's not really a big deal.",4.0
I've actually owned these for a year.  Work muscles at home with door jam attachment and pack for wintering away from home.  I've worked with a trainer ~ these bands fill in just fine when needed.  I thought they might stretch out of shape but that hasn't happened.  I'm focused on upper body strength to ward off further loss of bone density.  Pro-active for strength seems like the a good plan.  I've been happy with Black Mountain Resistance bands.  I use these bands twice a week.,4.0
"got this for my mom was great value, great quality fast delivery.  She loves it, and looking forward to putting in her daily workout routine.  Had leg attachment for multi work out areas, excellent quality, and the door stop (jam) accessory for different options on using bands was a great addition.  This was well worth the value and monies paid, have been in contact with company since and great folks to do business with.  I would definately recommend this company and this product.",4.0
"I owned the Lifeline resistance bands prior to this purchase and I'm happy with it so far.

- Grips are comfortable, soft and squishy. Feels like memory foam.
- Bands are easily clipped on/off. Hopefully they last.
- Nice range of resistance between the extra light (2-4 lbs) and heavy (25-40 lbs). Of course, you can mix and match the bands to the desired resistance. I find anything more than three a bit cumbersome to handle efficiently though.
- Because of the clipping mechanism, it may be a bit odd when using it for overhead exercises. I find the latches sometimes scraping against my arms, but otherwise, it's fine.

Overall, pretty good in ease and comfort of use. Durability-wise, I've yet to see how well they withstand heavy usage.",4.0
I use this when I dint get to go to gym. It allows you to perform a lot of different excercise in the comfort at at home.,4.0
"Great product, good quality, easy to use. Its portable so its great if you travel a lot. You can do it anywhere.",4.0
bands recommended to me as low impact way to strengthen back and hamstrings to abate pain. very easy to used given color coding and nicely padded handles. i bought a manual with good photos of exercise positions for clarity. easy to do while listening to music or watching TV so easy to keep to the regimen. i would recommend readily  but probably no match for muscle building compared to weight training.,4.0
Product matched the on line description.  Purchased for my son's physical therapy for a dislocated shoulder.  We purchased a ring at the hardware store to loop the band thru so we could hook to wall mount to use both handles simultaneously.,4.0
Bought these as a recommendation for a easier workout for my condition. The concept is great but don't really have a place where I can use them on a regular basis.,4.0
These resistance bands are high quality and are great for a home workout or while on the road. I recommend looking up youtube videos for new ideas for resistance band workouts.,4.0
These bands are exactly what I was looking for! I use different bands for different exercises.  Very helpful and durable!,4.0
You get exactly what you expect.  I think I would like to mount these to a wall or door as I believe it will work better.  But works well for my P90X.,4.0
Have not had the opportunity to use all the accessories so far but what I have used meets my expectations.  Nice product.,4.0
"I purchased the Black Mountain Products Resistance Band Set for a series of core exercises to rehab a pelvis and low-back injury. I had previously used a more expensive set of bands made by Gold's Gym. I would certainly recommend the Black Mountain set based on quality, price and ease of use. I really like the door anchor attachment, which comes in handy when doing two handed exercises. The handles for the bands are sturdy and sized well. And the bag, while cheap, is nice to have for travel and just to clean up after a workout. The only reason for a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating is the carabiner clips are a little trickier than I'd like and do not swivel in the straps the best. It does not impact exercise movements or safety, just me being picky.",4.0
These bands are well made and come in a convenient carrying case.  My whole family shares them.  They are versatile and great for all with the elasticity variations.,4.0
Everything seems to be of good quality.  I haven't owned it very long - will update on longevity later on.,4.0
"These are a great set.  I have noticed that some bands start to wear if you stand on them a lot.  Other than that, they have held up well and add a lot of resistance to my training.",4.0
Been using for about a month now and can definitely see a difference in my appearance. Cuts you up quickly... Love the stackable bands...just wish it came with more weight,4.0
Fun for the whole family. Easy to use and store. Lots of great workouts you can use the bands for. We enjoy the bands. Would recommend.,4.0
"The Black Mountain Products Resistance Band Set is a great addition to my home work out kit. I have definitely enjoyed them thus far. They are quite easy to set up and do not occupy much space while storing. The only thing I would suggest in order to upgrade the product, is to write down the resistance range of each color band in the handle so you don't have guess what resistance you are using. Secondly, covering the handle (material between the foam / plastic handle to the D-Ring) with a less rough material to prevent the handle burn created during the work out session.",4.0
"I mainly got these for my wife since she was having trouble with pullups, but I've used them too and they are pretty decent. Best part is the portability; we travel a lot and this mitigates my separation anxiety from my barbell a little bit but is definitely no substitute. They are fine for my wife.

It could do with higher resistance bands.",4.0
"Using these for P90X3, and by and large they're pretty good. My only complaint is that the bands are not high-resistance enough. Even if I put the top two together, it's still not much of a workout. Putting three together is cumbersome.

Other than that, they work great, and the bag is very handy.",4.0
I got this for some basic workouts. Does the job well. Definitely can't replace dumbbells though. Took off on star because I really wish it came with a way to wrap up the bands because all the bands being lose will make it a jumbled mess.,4.0
"Bought these to supplement the other Black Mountain set with attached handles. I blew out the strongest weight on that set, so I picked up this one with interchangeable handles to mix and match bands and increase the weight as I progressed.
It can be annoying swapping out the bands between exercises, but it's worth it to avoid the expense and storage of a weight set. Black Mountain has great products, but I would recommend the set with attached handles.",4.0
I really like the bands overall. I had extremely low expectations of them initially but after a month I have definitely begun to notice significant effects from use. The bands would be much better if the handle had the attachment clip instead of the actual band. This way adding/removing bands to increase/decrease resistance would not be so tenuous.,4.0
"These bands are sturdy and durable, have been using them for a few weeks every day now and they are still strong. Makes your muscles and joints feel great as well, if your'e going to get resistance bands you should get these ones. Also, it comes with a velcro strap that you can attach to a machine at your gym so you can do more quad and hamstring exercises.",4.0
This product works great for me and my clients easy to transport for home training on the go.  Only downside is its elastic aka it stretches but bmp has no problem with great customer service.,4.0
I bought these after looking at local sports stores and they wanted to charge 10 per band and per handle.  It does what I need it to do and nothing more.  Great alternative to expensive bands.  Carabineers could be upgrader to a higher quality and I wouldn't complain but over all they are good bands.,4.0
"The bands work great and allow a lot of flexibility in your workout.  Require much less space than traditional workout equipment but provide the same benefits.  Good reference sheet that shows exercises, but I would have appreciated some information about a simple ""starter"" plan that I could have used to get started with the bands.",4.0
"I've been using these regularly for a couple of months now, and am pleased with the quality and operation.  The only snags I can think of are that the instructions get a little rumply inside the bag, and when you have all the bands in use the rings get a little crowded.  Would recommend to a friend, would buy again.",4.0
I can no longer use 'free' weights. Nor do I want to go to a gym and wait to use the 'machines'. These seem to do what I need for them to do.  Help keep the 'tone' or maybe say regain some of the 'tone' for the muscle.  The shipping was efficient.  The package arrived in excellent shape.  The web site for the company that makes them is a good site.  BUT.............................. I have just now seen I could have bought them CHEAPER with free shipping directly from the company.  I could have saved a couple of bucks.,4.0
Love em..... Best decision I made... Bands works perfect.... I take them to the gym with me everyday and I'm starting to see results... Will tell my friends about them,4.0
I have just started using these bands in my daily workout.  They are durable and do what they are supposed to do.  I will update if anything gets better or worse.,4.0
I'm mostly using the black and red bands. The lighter strength ones are pretty much useless to me. Maybe at some point I'll add them to the black and red. The door anchor is ingenious though.,4.0
"I like to use resistance bands, they are easy to use and I pack them with me when I travel. This set includes everything that I need for a quick workout. I'm 5'3"" and the resistance bands work out for me.",4.0

"I purchased these after a recommendation from a friend.

Overall, I love the bands and they've been going strong for about 3 months now with regular use.  I haven't tried stacking the bands yet, but I find them easy to use and interchange.  The over the door strap is also very sturdy and has worked well for me.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that it would be nice to have an extra set of handles.  I am also 5'11"" and it does seem like I have to stretch these a bit far for full resistance.

All in all, I'm happy with my purchase!",4.0
I love these! These give me just what I needed to do the Chalene Extreme program without having free weights. They give you a great workout!,4.0
"I've been using these as a supplement to the days I can't make it to the Gym.  So far they've worked real well. I'm relatively new to resistance band training and am still in the process of trying to figure out the right combination of bands to use for each exercise. The clips are great and make it real easy to add and remove bands for each exercise.  They seem to be well constructed and appear they will hold up real well, only time will tell.  I'm excited to take these with me when I travel.",4.0

I share these bands with my husband when we workout together, so it is kind of a pain to have to swap out the handles with another size band. Despite not having two pairs of handles, I still really love these bands. They are made well and worth the buy.",4.0
I purchased these bands with door attachment to modifications for pull ups. I think the strap attachement and the bands work great. I typically use the red or black band for more resistance.,4.0
"I recently bought a replacement set of my BMP Stackable resistance bands (before realizing they are guaranteed for life).  I am not disappointed about this though as this is a great product and I am very pleased with how long my original set lasted me (~1year of use with The Asylum and Asylum 2 workouts). I am happy to support a company with a good product at a reasonable price.  Eventually I had to replace them though because 3/5 of them had snapped over the course of the year.  The resistance that they provide is adequate for me, though I am considering buying the extra orange and purple bands as I have recently had to use multiple bands for increased resistance as I am getting stronger.  But thats the beauty of stackable bands. I would buy these again and again and will look for this company when buying more fitness equipment.

Cons:
- I do not think that the basic set by itself is heavy enough for a man who is relatively fit.
- The new set of bands appear not as well made as my originals.  The carabiners seem lighter and less sturdy. And the bands used to be mounted on a swiveling clip, so your band never got coiled.  Now it is secured by a thick loop of fabric on the carabiner, which seems too big and they can now get twisted during your work out.
- The new handles are much larger than the first set and for certain exercises are cumbersome for a woman's hands.",4.0
"I chose these sets for two reasons
1. Price, low but not soo low I question durability
2. USA Company, you cannot find a deal this good, this durable that also keeps a great american company alive.

Pros:
Great range of resistance
Price
Durable
Well constructed

Cons:
One pair of handles: This is important if you plan on sharing this equipment with your loved one.
No listing of resistance weight outside of paper that you lose easily: Should be printed on the carrying case but it is not.

Overall: Very happy with my purchase, the only improvement I could ask is that they print the weight equivalent on the carrying bag for convenience. Although it is fairly easy to estimate by the diameter of the band.",4.0
I purchased this because with my crazy schedule lately it is hard to get to the gym. So I saw this on one of lighting deals and it was a great price so I thought I try it out. If your looking for a intense workout with high resistance this may not be for you.  But if you want something to use when you can't to the gym this is excellent.  On a side note after I purchased this we had all of that snow so I had a chance to really use it for a few days in a row and it was good.,4.0
It is a bit overpriced for what it is.  Does the advertised job.  Should have some sort of pouch for storage of the items included.,4.0
"I like the versatility of this set.  I like being able to anchor them into a doorway, and I like having the various levels of resistance.  the booklet that comes with it has been helpful to me also.",4.0
"Easy to set up and use. My wife and I used them when we traveled and they worked out great, especially when it wasn't convenient for us to find a Planet Fitness. I only wish they came with a manual to suggest different exercises. I mean, it wasn't a problem, since we could pretty much figure things out for the most part. But we felt as if maybe we were missing some good exercises.",4.0
Excellent way to exercise at my sedentary job. I would recommend this for anyone that has to sit a lot at work.,4.0
"I bought these for use at home with programs such as t25, p90x, etc etc. They definitely get the job done and are a lot cheaper than having a bunch of dumbbells at home.

They would not be great for any serious weight training, real weights and dumbbells would be best there, but these are one of the best solutions at home with out a dedicated gym.",4.0
I take these with me when I travel between jobs.  These allow me to get a workout in even when I am not near a gym.,4.0
"Bought this for more options to do the 10 minute trainer and other
tubing workouts.  Easy to use, very durable, clearly a quality product....
I would order a waistband attachment if they sold one but could not find one on their website.",4.0
"I like these bands. High quality, at a good price.

Been going to the gym while my boys swim, and now that swim season is ending wanted to keep up with excercising. These fit the bill perfectly. Working out at home is easy and productive with the resistance these bands offer.

More handles would be nice, but not totally necessary and can be purchased separately if i really want them.

So far so good. no complaints.

Good product, would buy them again and would recommend them.",4.0
"The Black Mountain Resistanace Band Set with  the Door Anchor, and Ankle Strap arrived promptly to my home. I like the fact this product can set up quickly and various bands can be added for increase resistance. The other advantage I find favorable is the ease to take the bands with me while I am traveling. The set-up is simple to use and gives me a good workout.",4.0
"I bought this set to help my P90X3 workout. They're been working out well for the most part. One of the things that drives me insane is switching the handles though. It takes me a while and you don't want to pause the workout every time you want to switch the colors. I've purchased a second handle already but I feel like the set should probably come with at least two. Another thing about the handles... When I'm rushing to switch bands, I always expect the hook to be on the handle. I don't know why it confuses me so much but it does.",4.0
"I originally purchased the resitance bands for myself, but found them a little long...I am very short at 5' tall.  My husband, who is 6' tall, usually works out every day at the gym, and decided to take these with him when he has to travel for work.  He prefers the gym, but when one isn't available he says this is a great alternative.  He uses several of the  bands to get enough resistance and says a little more would be better, but he is used to lifting heavy weight at the gym.",4.0
"I like this band, very compact, easy to store and Band exercises I find more beneficial as tension in the muscles is maintained through flexion and extension. I would recommend this band",4.0
"Very well made, couldn't be happier with this purchase. Every workout you can do with dumbbells can be replicated with the bands, and adding a loop really increases intensity. Don't think I've used regular weights since these arrived, and I don't think I'll be going back to them.",4.0
"I bought this set of bands because I'm going to be staying at home to raise a child for a while so I won't be able to hit the gym nor do I have enough room to build a small weight room.  These are a great addition to body weight exercises, they add a bit more variety to the routine.  They are small and portable and you add them together to increase weight.

That being said they are a bit on the short side, you will have a hard time doing something like a military press if you're standing up.  You'll have to modify your exercise to either do it one handed or on some kind of low bench.  I do really like their customer service, you call the number and get a person and they take care of you right there.",4.0
"I bought these bands since they are the same ones I use at the gym with my personal trainer.  Thought since they are good enough for the pro gym, they are good enough for me, and i haven't been disappointed.  The door hinge strap works well, but at some point I am going to want some fixed anchor points on the wall, because adjusting the position between exercises is a little cumbersome.  I would definitely buy these again if I had to do over, and would recommend to anyone else.  And the price is right too!",4.0
"This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. The bands and handles are a breeze to change out and offer plenty of resistance when combined together. I would say they were of professional quality.

So what's not to like? I would have preferred rubberized handles vs. the foam. I feel they last longer and don't soak up sweat a much. My only other suggestion is related to the carrying pouch. It is a nice addition, but I would have preferred a nylon mesh type with a draw string, again for longevity and ventilation.

Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend them to friends and family.",4.0
Great product. Tone muscles while adding strength with minimul bulk. Alternative work out for those who want a simple but effective training system. Strong reinforced bands with all the needed anchors handles and wraps for a total body work out.,4.0
"This is a great set of bands for simply workouts .  Being a couch tater, I like to work these instead of lying about. It's simple.",4.0
"I always bring these with me while travelling. They are so light and can be used anywhere. The quality make it useful for day to day usage and with so many bands of resistance, I would imagine a good fit for any user.",4.0
Love the quality of the bands and that they are interchangeable. Like that you get the ankle strap and the over the door accessory,4.0
"All bands and attachments fit into a small easy to travel with bag.  The bands, straps, and carabiners area all very good quality.  These are great bands for standard pulling exercises.  While doing more advanced exercises like rear tricep curls, the carabiners have a tendency to dig into my wrists.  Aside from that, I highly recommend this product.",4.0
"Did a comparison of what was available at local retail stores and found that these had a lot more resistance options at a much better price.  Quality seems good (have had them for about a month...no complaints) and the storage bag is extremely nice for those of us sharing our home gym with our living space.  For anyone who has used a Bowflex and is familiar with the rod setup, the concept here is similar.

Last, but not least, my wife is recovering form shoulder surgery and these have been great.  Being able to customize the resistance and a use a light load when necessary is ideal.  Her range of motion and strength have increased considerably due in part to these resistance bands.",4.0
This a great product.  I travel a lot for work and the portability of this product is what appealed to me most as I could continue my workouts while on the road.  The materials are sturdy and compact.,4.0
"These things work well and have held up well.
Pros: Everything clips together so you can combine handles with different combinations of bands.  The door anchor works well and the ankle strap worked great for doing hip exercises after my hip replacement.  I now use the red band to keep my upper body/arms toned up with lots of repetitions. The wife uses the yellow band.  It all fits in a pouch for storage.  More convenient than weights and you can take it traveling with you.

Cons: The handles could be a little wider.  I suppose they also could be nicer built but I'm sure that would cost more.

Does a good job for what it is.",4.0
"I'm a VERY busy professional, and my fitness was suffering from lack of time to get to the gym. I bought these bands, and the quality of manufacture was better than I expected; they're really put together well. But, for their purpose, they work very well - they offer good, adjustable resistance and do give you a workout that you can feel when you're done - and saving a drive to the gym. I'm very pleased with the purchase.",4.0
this is all the extra you need to complete your workout with  Marcy cardio mini cycle. I would suggest this to anyone,4.0
"I injured my back and was sent to physical therapist.  Some of the exercises she assigned required bands.  I bought this set because of the variety of bands included and the favorable reviews.  I've had the set for almost a month and I use them 5 or 6 times a week, I am very happy with the purchase.  The bands are made well and, again, I appreciate the variety of resistance which matches the variety of exercises I need to perform.",4.0
"Purchased this set to replace a set that was deteriorating from use and age. These tube type bands are a much better alternative to the thin flat bands. A fairly good assortment of tension(s) The storage bag is nice, but I prefer to hang them on the wall to eliminate digging through the bag and untangling.",4.0
"Great set of resistance bands, you can feel the quality!  And made in the USA!  Very versatile, can be used for many different exercises.  I would love if this set included a ceiling mount.  The included door frame mount is very study, however, I just don't have a door that closes in an area where I'll use this.",4.0
"I've read through many of the lower rated reviews and they seem to indicate problems mostly arise from individual band defects, not a defect of the entire line. I've used these for several weeks now and see no problems. Everything is working great and it's an effective workout. Plus from what I've heard of the customer service and the lifetime warranty, I'm optimistic that if I have problems down the line they will be corrected by the company. I'd highly recommend buying this product.",4.0
Worth the money. A great travel tool. I recomend it to anyone traveling or to someone who can't get to the gym.,4.0
I like the bands.  The quality of the bands and the handles are good.  Never used the door anchor or ankle strap.  I do wish there was a way to keep the bands together when you hook several up at the same time.  Overall I am happy and to date have not broken the ends off of any of the bands.  The size is nice and small for taking on the road if you need to.,4.0
The bands are a great thing to have in the house when you don't feel like making it to the gym. They don't take up any space and they are very versatile for a variety of different workouts.,4.0
"Background: I'm a college-aged guy and had surgery on my left elbow about 4 months ago. I've been working around the physical limitations that I've been left with, but some muscle groups are still particularly hard to hit. In particular, most tricep extensions cause a subluxation, or ""popping"", of the nerve in my left elbow, so any free weight or body weight exercises that involve my left tricep come at the price of hitting my funny bone over and over. I've used resistance tubing with group workout classes in the past, so I thought I might be able to work my triceps using resistance tubing at different angles that wouldn't cause as much irritation. I picked up the Black Mountain resistance band set and so far, so good. I can use different combination of bands to find the ""sweet spot"" that gives me enough resistance to work my triceps to full extension, but eases up when I release to a bent state so that my elbow doesn't pop.

In short, here are the pros and cons I've come up with after a couple weeks of using the bands:

Pros:
- Modular design saves space and maximizes resistance options. Having only two handles on which the bands of various resistances attach to saves space (fewer handles) and allows you to combine different bands to hit higher resistances.
- Door anchor easily fits through the slot between the hinge side of the door and the door frame
- So far, the bands are staying in good shape
- Carrying case with zipper helps keep everything together and can easily fit inside a gym bag, backpack, or drawstring bag.

Cons:
- Having only two handles for an entire set of resistance bands makes it harder to keep a fluid workout, as changing the resistance will require you to stop and unclip/reclip bands (which I've found tedious when I'm wearing workout gloves and am not as dexterous after a few strength sets)
- Putting the bands back inside the bag after a hard workout can be quite the task, as they'll often slide back out if you try to stuff everything in at once.

I would recommend this product to anyone recovering from an athletic injury or surgery. It would also work well for beginners to strength training, or someone who is more advanced but doesn't have easy access to a gym and would keep this for personal use at home.",4.0
Becoming a bag very well packaged and easy to carry with you for traveling.  It makes it easy to maintain your strength training while on the road or at home. I agree with other reviews. It could be a bit more sturdy.,4.0
"I purchased these bands to use with the P90x3 workout series. I have only had them 2 weeks, but they seem to be working out just fine. The door anchor works well & the storage bag is a nice way to keep all the bands together without damage. The bag also makes it convenient to take the with you when traveling.",4.0
"These work well. It is easy to attach multiple bands for more resistance. They're easier to use that way if you loosely secure them together in the middle. The weight of each band isn't marked on the band itself, that I could find, which could be a nice addition. Overall, though, they are durable and do what they're made to do.",4.0
Will recommend you get a lot for the money. I am using it for about 2 months still no problem.,4.0
"I have just completed P90X and have used these bands exclusively (no dumbbells or pull-up bars, only bands).  The bands have done everything they have been asked to do with only a few areas of visible wear and tear.  I believe those areas were mostly caused when I needed to stand on the band to increase the resistance.  Even with that, it appears they will last for a long time.  I especially like the easy to use door attachment to allow for pushup/pullup exercises.  Overall, good value for the money.",4.0
"The Bands are GREAT, the grips not so much. They are made quite cheaply. Mine broke shortly after my purchase. I ended up making my own. Bands still hold strong.",4.0
"I have been using them for 3 weeks now. I love the variance of resistance. I use them when I am not feeling up to the heavy weights, or it is before I go to bed. It would be nice if they would include a 2nd ankle brace for speed purposes.",4.0
"Haven't been using it too long, but loving the variety that it adds to my home workout routine. Seeming quality product, although the door bearing is a bit flimsy, probably going to make my own that won't snap out with a good tug.",4.0
"I got this product bundle a couple months ago and truly enjoy it. I use them while watching TV, taking a break from my computer or bring the bands along when I am traveling which is often. I like these resistance bands better than my resistance loops too. With the handles, it does not hurt my hands like the loops. I also like this ""package"" where everything is organized. I think there are two downsides however. One, the set-up for connecting to a door is not viable for every home depending on how doors are put. I honestly do not have one spot in my house where I can use the set-up and not hit another wall or lamp or something. One needs to have space and I did not understand that beforehand. Next, using the guidebook, I was hoping there would be more leg exercises with the bands - all the examples are arms. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the purchase. $30 is worth it! In the black zipped bag, I can bring this portable workout with me when I travel and need to fight stress. It also builds my upper body (again mostly arm workouts) to help with my yoga chatturanga dandasanas!",4.0
"I haven't used it yet, but it came with all the parts. It looks easy enough to use. The little bag it comes in is convenient.",4.0
I would like to have slightly larger handles in order to avoid hurting my hands but these bands are very good for the price that I paid.,4.0
"I have been using a  personal trainer for the past 4 months and decided that I would try to do these resistance exercises at home.  Very easy to install and to use with the instructions that came with the set and in addition I added some of the exercises I did with my trainer.....and for much less expense!  Stacking the straps makes sense.  I spoke with one of the owners about an additional weighted strap which is gratis and he gave me some excellent suggestions for using the equipment.  A family run business....What a pleasure!  BTW.....I am a75 year old female, am pulling between 35 and 55 lbs and lifting free weights of 12-15 lbs.  Let's hear it for the grey panthers!!!",4.0
My son asked me to buy this for him--he used it as a sort of home gym while he lived with us. He brought it with him to Cambodia so he must like it.,4.0
"Have these for about a week now. Very well made, and good selection of differing strength bands. The door anchor and ankle strap increase their usefulness, adding more exercises that you can do. Truthfully, I am an older guy and way out of shape, and so the lightest weight band is giving me a pretty good workout right now. Looking forward to getting more in shape and changing to the stronger bands.
Only drawback is that the booklet that comes with it has few exercises, and I find that those are not that well explained or illustrated. However, You Tube has tons of videos with a wide range of resistance band exercises, and many of those are very helpful in demonstrating the different exercises one can do and follow along with.
Overall, this is a great product, and I highly recommend it.",4.0
"These bands are what keep me from going crazy. I actually have two sets, so that I can show other people how to use them while I do my workout. The handles feel cheaper than other bands that I've used, but they hold up well enough. The ankle piece, I'm on the fence about. I compare it to the IronMan ankle piece that is a lot beefier, and I trust it. So far it's held, but it feels flimsy.
I would prefer the rings on the foam handles were a little bit larger, in case i want to double up more bands and have them all on a single handle (So you could be hooking up more than 5 rings at the same time.
Overall they are getting a lot of use, and eventually they will wear down, but the price is good enough that it's worth going through a new set, even every few months. Customer service is awesome, you call these guys and thy pick up the phone and actually talk to you. That's really a plus",4.0
"I had been looking for something similar to the Pilates springboard that I could use in my apartment in between my 2 Pilates classes a week. This product is a perfect fit. I've only been using it for a few days but the quality seems good and I am hoping nothing breaks before it's time as is mentioned in some of the reviews here. I tend to double or triple up on the bands if I am looking for a higher resistance, which I am hoping will reduce the wear on an individual band. Resistance training has been a god send in treating the arthritis that has developed in my spine. I am still fairly young and losing mobility is just not an option at this stage of my life. This kind of workout along with yoga and massage/acupuncture/chiropractic care has enabled me to only need a very low dose of a mild medication. I am so glad to have found a way to do resistance training at home and for such a good price.",4.0
"I like this product very much.  I have only used them for several weeks, but they are a good alternative to using free weights.  They make my workout more interesting.  The carrying bag makes it very easy to take the bands on business trips.  The handles are very comfortable.  I am impressed with the quality for the price.",4.0
"I got these for Christmas as a gift and they are a great addition to my home gym. I anticipate using them primarily for shoulders, biceps, and triceps workouts. They seem sturdy, but I am sure they will begin to wear out over time. I cannot imagine a resistance band that will stay in perfect condition forever. They come with a list of exercises which is convenient for getting new ideas for workouts. Also, I don't typically spend a lot of time reviewing products, but they offered a free orange band with a review and that seemed like a good deal to me. It only takes a few minutes to write a review and they are going to send out a whole new strap.",4.0
"A very different product and worth the purchase.  Makes you want to try something new.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",4.0
My husband is a pilot and takes one or two of these at a time.  States he gets a great workout from them.  Really not small enough of a bag to take it all at once.,4.0
"These work well- combining bands helps you add and reduce weight and the quality seems pretty good.  Some exercises are hard to accomplish because of the length of the straps, but that's not the fault of the manufacturer.  Longer or shorter would face their own downsides.  Great for travel.",4.0
I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try out resistance bands for the first time. Another more heavy duty band is provided for free all you have to do is call to receive the band. They are very friendly as well. Now about the handles it has plastic casing. They both and now it looks like the whole thing would rip apart. I had them replaced for free by the company but it happen  again after a few more workouts. So if your workouts aren't that strenuous they might be perfect.,4.0
I live a life on the road and these are light and portable.  Finally a workout I can take with me!,4.0
"Packaged very well and arrived on time. Don't compare it to P90X bands as they are almost double the cost of these. I would definitely purchase other products from BMP. I would also prefer additional handles so do not have to switch out bands constantly while exercising.

Bonus: After providing feedback, you can call them to send you an orange band for free.",4.0
"I bought these as I have a set of adjustable-weight dumbells in my home gym, but I wanted to be able to try some new excersizes and have some variety.  The resistance band set has worked great to that end.

Additionally, the set is small enough that I can pack them in a backpack or suitcase in case I want some workout options for business travel or vacation.  This is a highly useful product for the price.",4.0
This is an awesome product and for a good price.  I use this on a daily basis for back strengthening.,4.0
"I am about half way through the P90X workout and have been using these straps.  So far they have held up well.  Clipping straps onto and off of the handles is quick and easy, so I can move from less to more (or more to less) resistance without hassle.  There is a short guide which tells you the relative resistance of each color band, so you can add up or subtract down to the resistance you want.  While I am sure there are better bands out there, I am also sure you would pay more for them.  This is a good product at a reasonable price.",4.0
Great quality and good selection of different resistances.  Easy to use. Comes with a little book of excersises that's really basic. I also ordered a video an combine the two for more variety and more leg work. Priced in store for $15 for one so you can't beat the price!,4.0
Been using these bands from time to time and so far so good. Elasticity is great and the accessories come in handy. Just wish they were a tad longer.,4.0
"The bands work well.  I especially like the ability to add multiple bands to increase the resistance.  This allows for the ability to have greater resistance without having multiple ""fixed"" bands. The entire set is very portable and good for travel.  I have used the door anchor and it works well without problems.  The bands themselves seem durable.

For my needs a set with heavier bands would be nice.  I don't really use the lightest bands. All in all, this is a solid set and I am happy with my purchase.  Stronger folks may want to purchase another heavy band to add to this set.",4.0
"This is a pretty decent set of resistance bands. The only thing I would change about it, is that the band themselves are a little bit long. When you put the attachments on them, they are too long to do some of the exercises I would like to do. I have tried to tie the bands in knots to remedy this, but they are very hard to untie, so I try to avoid doing that. Also, if you call the company after you get your package, they will send you a free orange band, which is even stronger than the strongest band in this pack. That was a nice little bonus!",4.0
I have some trouble lining up the bands with the posted resistance. It doesn't exactly correspond with the written resistance levels. But the product is  very useful in my exercise routine,4.0
Had these for many months now.  Love them.  They have worked as described.  I use them fairly often in my workout routine and they work.  I combine bands as prescribed to get certain amount of (high) resistance.  The rubber used seem of good quality so far.  I check them before each time I use them and so far so good.  No cracking or obvious weakening of the item.,4.0
"hi I bought this band a while back. I used it with XT Tapout. The handle is made of plastic can be fragile. I snapped one of the handle accidentally and cracked. Other than that, it's still manageable.",4.0
"Great product. the ability to combine weights makes it easier for guys who need a little more resistance than the single heavy bands. The bands have been great, quality has not been an issue and none have broken on me so far. The linking chains make it easy to add/reduce bands for more or less resistance.

The only issue I have is that you have to memorize the weights of the bands, they weights are not written on the band so you need the piece of paper to know what your using.",4.0
"If you're looking for something to use in your small room, this is a good purchase. Everything comes as listed. Although the bands kinda gets in your way,. But it's strong and well made. I suggests getting something that you can install on your door so it sits on place.",4.0
I am very pleased with this band set. It seems to be well made and it is easy to use two bands at a time.,4.0
"Our trainer told us these were the best resistance bands and she was right!  They came with all the accessories we could want, even with a bag to keep them all in, not that the bands ever go back in.  We use these every day as part of our home-gym workout and are very happy with them, including the comfortable hand grips.",4.0
The variety in bands is great to have. Wish there was a wider range of tension though. The handles and connections are very solid. No issues of them coming apart or the bands breaking. For more tension you may want to put colors together.,4.0
For the price I can not believe the number of muscle groups that can be worked with these bands and attachments. Package also includes instructional booklet and carrying case. Great for traveling.,4.0
I like these bands. They are perfect for someone wanting to work out in a small apartment. Only thing I wish it came with was some kind of attachment to a pull up bar similar to the door jam attachment. Sure you can just wrap them around the bar but I wonder if over time that might wear on the bands. But so far they work fine.,4.0
Excellent to use in my workouts. I would give 5 stars if it only came with an extra set of handles. I love the fact that you can change the strength.,4.0
"My husband & I had been working with a trainer & now want to work out on our own at home, so purchased this set.  Our trainer likes the set & showed us more things we could do with the various bands.  We are very pleased with the quality of the product.  I called to order an extra set of handles, as it comes with one set that is detachable to use on any of the bands. I received excellent customer service.  It came with a pamphlet showing a few exercises, not many.  This is part of our continued strength training at home to keep us sixty-something strong.",4.0
"great product, strong, really resistant. well worth the price. customer support is really good too.just would like the clamps to e a bit larger.",4.0
"This is a great ""starter"" set, with enough variation to allow beginner to advanced users options.  I appreciate the high quality of the bands and the ability to attach the same handle set to any of them.  The only request I have is for an additional set of handles -- that way, you could have 2 bands ready to go for your workout and interchange them quickly, instead of having to stop and unlock/reconnect when switching ""weights"".  All in all, a great product that I have enjoyed using and look forward to bringing with me when I travel.  (I have not had reason to use the door anchor yet, but have been able to do plenty of exercises without it.)",4.0
Very good quality resistance bands... will vouch for these anytime. Would definitely recommend these bands to people who wanna work out at home !!,4.0
This is a perfect set to keep packed up for when you are traveling.  They don't take up too much room and if you know what to do with them you can get a complete work out no matter where you are.,4.0
"I had my left knee replaced in early January & used this product as prescribed by my physical therapist to strengthen my leg . I have used this product for over nine months with great results.

"Pros:
 *** First I love the band because it's very affordable and made in mainland US.
 *** It is very convenient gym equipment to have... I can bring it anywhere I would wish to.
 *** It is a Pocket Gym with the same benefits of a traditional gym that eats up a lot of space to set up.
 *** Lots of upper body, lower body, and core exercises are provided on their website: *** [...]
 *** Quick delivery, courteous customer service.

Cons:
 *** Would be great if the length could be shortened to become suitable for a shorter/smaller person.
 *** Would be awesome if the ""Door Anchor"" could be mounted to a door bottom with slightly bigger gap.
 *** It would be nice if the band has got a jacket or protective cover to protect it from potentially sharp surfaces/materials while being use.",4.0
"I bought this exercise band set to make sure I had away to continue strength training in the office while my weights sit in my garage.  I'm finding after a few weeks of regular use that these bands are high quality and working well.  A couple of notes: The strap is threaded through the handle but not attached, so the handle slides on the strap while in use, rubbing the strap against my hand as I complete my motions.  I would prefer it was fixed.  Also, the door anchor depends on the door being closed (and locked) for safety - if someone opened the door, it would be dangerous (I don't have a lock on my office door).  I will be using a doorstop to keep the door closed.  The relatively light exercise sheet isn't that helpful, but so many exercise routines are available immediately online that I don't think that matters much.  The part of this purchase that I love is the FULL guarantee for the materials and obviously attentive customer service.  I will always take some chances with a product if I know they answer the phone and back up what they sell.",4.0
Use these for my P90x workout.  Hardest part is getting the resistance right for your workout and making rapid changes (removingor adding) bands.  Overall these have held up well.,4.0
"I am a Personal Trainer by profession from Bangalore, India. I wanted to add more depth to my clients' workout, so i found this Black Mountain product very useful and portable. Even my clients love it!",4.0
i love these. it's good enough for most exercises i do for most workouts. very easy for travelling because they are not bulky or heavy to put in carry on.,4.0
"I bought a set of these bands to work with my fianc on strength training and also so I can get some good work in at home. I can honestly say this is one of the better sets of resistance bands I've seen anywhere for the price. I love how much variance in weight there is. It allows me to start from square one with my fianc, who is a beginning strength trainer; but I can easily increase the weight for her or myself. The latch mechanism is awesome and gives me much more confidence in use than the plastic latches a lot of other systems use. The durability of the bands themselves are nice as well.

My only quarrel is that I wish the bands were about 6 inches longer. I am a taller (6'2"") guy and these bands make it a little tough to do any overhead type movements when anchoring the band at my feet. I can and have found ways to modify the workout, but it would just be more convenient to have the extra length.

Overall, these are awesome. In fact, I've invested in a second set of these and look forward to challenging myself, my fianc, and everyone else I train with these!",4.0
"These are very high quality resistance bands.  The rubber pieces are guaranteed forever.  I just wish there were more than one set of handles, although I'm pretty sure more can be ordered - probably on Amazon.",4.0
"These were purchased for a relative to assist with their recovery from a debilitating stroke.  The relatively light resistance and ease of use, so far has been 'just what the doctor ordered'.",4.0
This product overall turned out a lot better than I had originally thought it would. Great price and works very well.,4.0
"Exactly what I expected.  Easy to use and change out. I need to understand the door anchor a bit more.
I need to get to using them more, they would work even better.",4.0
I bought these resistance bands because of my odd work hours and frequent travel. So far I'm very pleased with my purchase. They are very easy to fit into any size carry on and don't take up too much space. And lets face it a lot of hotel fitness rooms are very limited in their selection besides maybe a treadmill. These bands let me get in a bit of strength training as well while I'm on the road. Definitely would recommend for someone who likes to stay in shape and has to travel.,4.0
"I bought this set of bands to work on rehabbing my knee outside of the gym. This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.

Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer. Hopefully, I am not overstating the obvious, but I found this feature easier to do with the bands than with free weights.",4.0
"Good for those small exercises that one can't do with freeweights. I use it for slight rehab on a knee. It's perfect for that. With the door stoppers you can get angles that really help (if you have old joints). Of course it's all very light, so I can't see doing anything heavy (for those looking for something to supplement freeweights, such as wrapping around barbells when doing squats and so forth) with these, but they're good so far and seem to be made to last.",4.0
"These bands are a decent substitute for actual weights. They are strong and they won't snap. I put them through a tough challenge as soon as I got them (P90X) and I think they last well. Resistance maintained throughout my 90 days of the program. I will say, though, at the end of my ordeal the red band (since that's the one I used more often) became noticeably longer than the others. But I assume this is inevitable being that they are after all rubber bands.",4.0
these rubberbands do  the trick! thy are very tough and can withstand a lot of stretch and they are heavy to pull. exactly what i wanted,4.0
"I'm a 5'3"" woman, just beginning a strength training routine.  The bands are plenty long for me and the assortment of band strengths are appropriate for the exercises I'm doing.  I've used the bands three times this week, and so far they seem fine.  The bands, handles, and ankle strap are all good quality and comfortable, and the door anchor works well. It would have been helpful to have a ""parts list"" in the instruction manual.  It took me a while to figure out what the ankle band was for. So far I'm very satisfied with the product.",4.0
I bought these specifically for golf swing exercises and they are great.  The quality is better than I would expect and the hand grips and comfortable.  You can easily use different combinations of bands to achieve various resistances.  I'm now able to do exercises throughout the day at work in my downtime and reduce my night time workout time.,4.0
I got my shipment very fast. I like the booklet that came with the packet. It has simple workouts that are easy for beginners. I have been using these for a week now and I am really impressed with the product. I would definitely recommend this to others.,4.0
Makes muscles burn when using. Have to wait to see how long rubber bands last with me using them 6 days a week twice a day. Makes working out easier. Just stand on bands and start pumping while you watch tv.  Close strap in door and work out that way also.,4.0
"I bought this set to have for travel and it works perfectly.  Compact, nicely made and easy to use with the color codes.  Very pleased with the value of this product.",4.0
"Great for the price. I've had them for 3 weeks now. The bands are versatile, have a burly structure/design compared to other bands, and easy to travel with. I use them for rehab/PT purposes - not working out purposes - and they've been ideal so far.

My one suggestion would be a better door anchor. If you're trying to use the anchor they give you to the bottom of a door that has a small gap in it, it won't hold. Easily modifiable by duct taping a rag or shirt around the anchor but could definitely be improved.",4.0
I've used these bands a few times without issue or complaint.  I can't comment on longevity though as I haven't had them very long.,4.0
"I wanted to invest in some toning work out equipment to go along with a few other kinds I had. I am not one to exercise a whole lot, I do what I can with the time I have. So, I shopped around online and off but decided to get this one. I like it, it does it's job for how much I pay for it. I have never had any faulty problems with it (but keep in mind I don't use them every day).

-The only thing I didn't like were the handles, I think they were just too big for my small hands. They kept scraping against my wrist when I do bicep curls, tricep extensions and blah blah blah. Other than that small bit, I do enjoy them and they work well with my minimal workout.",4.0
"We purchased two sets of these bands for use with P90X.  We have completed one full cycle of P90X and part of a second cycle, although we eventually switched to weights for most of the program.  We continued to use these bands for pull-ups

The Good:
These bands are easy to use, and being able to clip multiple bands onto the handles is helpful.  Some people may need more weight than this set can provide.  Since my wife did not use the ""heaviest"" red band very often, I borrowed hers to make my simulate pull-ups more challenging.

The door strap works well near a hinge, and these bands also worked well over a pull up bar.  Overall they have held up fairly well.

The Bad:
Out of our two sets, one strap broke at the metal clasp.  I expected one of the rubber tubes to give out, but instead the metal snapped where the clip swivels around on the post that attaches to the band.  Fortunately no one was hurt when it went, but it left a mark on the top of the door frame when it went during a pull-up.

Some of the bands show a lot of wear from friction when standing on the band to shorten it or to increase tension, as the P90X videos demonstrate.  Again, none of them have snapped, but we stopped using one of the black bands just in case.

Overall:

I liked the bands to get started on P90X, but ultimately decided they weren't giving me the workout I wanted.  As soon as I switched to some ""dial weights"" I felt I was getting a better workout.  The weight ratings on these bands did not match up with using actual weights at all.  In theory, if I was lifting 20 lbs according to the band tension rating, I needed to back down to 10-15 pounds on the free weights.

Still, we were not disappointed in our purchase of these bands.  They are a good value and we are pleased to own and continue to use them.",4.0
I liked it but I think it could use and extra ankle strap for more variety of exercises and faster transitions.,4.0
"First of all, these are great bands for the price. I had previously bought bands from a Chinese supplier and the cables all snapped after a few months of use. These bands were cheaper, came with the carrying case and exercise chart, and the quality much better. The connection between the band and the bracket/strap is the key, and these are well-designed and shouldn't break.

The only issue I had was that I received 2 handles of different designs. One was smaller in girth and length, and had a smaller ring on the strap. It also didn't have a brand logo on it so I assume it was a previous revision/design. It is annoying to have 2 handles of different size (and strength - I'd rather the newer, stronger version). So I contacted the supplier, and they just offered to return the item for full refund, and I would need to re-order. I was travelling soon and taking these bands with me and I didn't have time to do that. They couldn't send me the proper handle directly, so I was quite disappointed with this.

See customer photos to find a picture of the different handles.

Good product, but the customer service wasn't above and beyond...",4.0
They work. And work me. Just what I wanted. Five stars if instructions were better and if bands were weight-labelled in addition to color-coded.,4.0
"I inherited these from a guy friend who is looking to build muscle mass.  They didn't work for him because of the intensity of his workout, it was too much for the bands.  Although, he did get some replaced by the company when they wore out quickly, so kudos to the company.  He gave them to me, because my workout isn't as strenuous, so he thought they would be helpful.  And they are great for what I do.  I dropped my gym membership because of cost, but still wanted to continue with one of the workouts I took regularly that used resistance bands.  (I would use these with a DVD, or exercise class, as the start up guide doesn't give a lot of information about specific exercises for toning all areas.)  These are perfect for what I do, and the variety of equipment they give you is excellent, you can change up your routine easily.  When I injured by shoulder (not seriously, just a strain), the yellow and blue bands give an easier workout without adding to the injury, and then I worked my way back up.  I'm very happy with them, and they have lasted several months even with almost daily use (full disclosure, there was a week or two where I was too lazy to do anything).  If you are looking for more serious workout/weight loss, I recommend adding other workouts to your routine, or getting more heavy duty equipment (although my body building friend told me they worked very well for him, but didn't last as long with a daily, super intense workout).  However, if you are like me and working out isn't easy to do (lack of motivation), so you stick to what you are able to commit too despite not losing much weight with it, I can recommend a supplement&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raspberry-Ketone-Platinum-2-Bottles-Clinical-Strength-All-Natural-Fat-Burning-Weight-Loss-Diet-Supplement-60-capsules/dp/B0093OHLM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raspberry Ketone Platinum (2 Bottles) - Clinical Strength - All Natural Fat Burning, Weight Loss, Diet Supplement, 60 capsules</a>&nbsp;- it's a great fat burner, and helps my workout actually turn around into weight loss and fat loss.  I can't judge the products from the serious trainer point of view, but from the couch potato point of view, the bands are great for toning, and the rasp ketone makes your workout more effective in losing fat.",4.0
"For isometrics this is almost a perfect set. It would be perfect if it had two ankle straps instead of one.
I have had this set for quite a while and all of the bands are still intact and not stretched out.
If you are thinking of using this for leg isometrics (sprint training) then you will need to use all of the bands together to get the required resistance.",4.0
"This set is great.  Does what it's suppose to and easy to interchange.  I got these for P90X and find myself liking a lighter set-up and heavier set-up.  You'd need 2 sets of handles for that, but this set is great otherwise.",4.0
Compact and easy to use for anyone. Work great! And take very little space to store. Very versatile. Definitely recommended.,4.0
"A while ago I hurt my rotator cuff doing a bench press.  I have since learned that bench pressing can put stress on your rotator cuff so these need to be strengthened separately.  These bands are provide a wide variety of tensions.  The handles are very comfortable.

My only gripe is you would think the box would have a set of set up instructions/tips as well as a basic set of routines.  No matter the latter can be found on Youtube.  Highly recommend this set of bands",4.0
I have had these bands for a short while after seeing a friend of mine with it on a trip we took to vegas. Being able to get a quick workout in the room without having to go to the gym was a big plus! only problem with my set was having one set of handles and taking the time to take off the band currently on it and to adjust accordingly to each workout. But buying another handle set will remedy this quickly.,4.0
So far i cannot complain. I was using them for P90X and they seem to be fine. A little short maybe but workable.,4.0
"I love it! I ordered it while I was in Afghanistan. I used it daily for strength training. The only thing I would change is the material of the storage bag. Its cheap and weak, it started tearing about 2 weeks after I received it. Overall, great, and I do mean great product..",4.0
"While I still can't figure out how the door anchor works (and there was very little documentation with the product), the quality of the bands and the variance of weights included is very good. The handles and joints are solid. I'd have no problem recommending this.",4.0
"Not a whole lot to say about them, other than the fact they seem like good quality bands that have lasted well over a year now. I don't use them daily, but try to get a couple uses a week. I'm happy with the purchase.",4.0
"I liked this setup that I went and ordered one for my Son.
Well made and easy to use. No hard impact so its easy on my old joints.
Able to get a great workout.",4.0
Came with no damage in shipping. Easy to assemble. Make sure  arms are alined with inner holes on long bar or else short bar won't connect. no shaking on doorframe for pull-up bar. Very happy,4.0
I recently injured my shoulder at the gym & was told by my physician that I would have to undergo Physical Therapy. A friend of mine who similarly injured his shoulder recommended the use of resistance bands. I have been using them for nearly a month & I am beginning to improve. I travel a lot for work and I am really pleased by the fact that I can roll them up in my suitcase and take them anywhere I go. The take up very little room in my bags.,4.0
I have no basis for comparison But so far these resistance cords have work very well for me. I have them attached to various places on the inside of my car and I use them for exercise during long car trips. The three orange resistance cord is the night touch too.,4.0
I have used these about 4 to 5 times a week for a light work out.  Haven't had any problems with them.  I like them but kind of wish i had just bought some weights.  Good product though!,4.0
"Haven't really gotten a chance to start my workouts yet with these bands, but they appear to be of good quality!",4.0
This product is decent quality for the money. It does the job and provides the resistance you need. They are a bit stiff though and it makes it a little hard to maneuver for certain exercises.,4.0
I've been using these resistance bands for P90X and are a good fit for all of their exercises. Might need to get bands with more resistance next time around.,4.0
"This set is a good value. You may want a more heavy-duty set for your daily home regimen, but these are well-built and a very good choice for travel.",4.0
"I travel quite a bit and, due to the nature of my work, live with only the items I can keep in my car. It is a compact set; it is smaller than a basketball when all of the items are inside the carry bag.

The accessories allow a wide variety of exercises. The included guide has several pages of exercises, but many more can be performed with this set if you are willing to do a little research.

I'm an average guy (not a bodybuilding enthusiast by any means) wishing to keep in shape. Regardless, I found that in order to find a challenging level of resistance for the majority of my exercises, it was necessary to combine several resistance bands. This is nothing more than an inconvenience, as there are enough bands to do essentially any exercise you may want to do unless you have an advanced level of fitness and strength. The upside to this is that you can achieve a range of resistance levels to challenge your specific ability by adding/removing bands as necessary.

For beginners, ""average"" people, and anyone who travels, this set provides plenty of challenge and variety to stay in shape while travelling or or in a living space with limited room for storage.",4.0
"Been using these with p90x for 3 weeks now.  They are great and they are exactly what I want because I need to combine bands and holding multiple handles was adding extra strain in my hands.  The ability to easily combine bands with one set of handles and having it be very mobile is a huge plus.  But in saying that the handles are plastic and I don't consider myself very strong, but at any rate one of the handles broke so now I have half a handle.",4.0
"They were a very good quality. I use for baseball workouts, and I have gotten a lot better. Bottom line, they are great bands",4.0
"I've been using the bands for a couple weeks for P90x.  Works great for the back exercises.  The door anchor works well for doing ""pull ups"".  Only downsides so far:
 - Takes a little while to switch the handles between bands.  There are other bands out there with handles that are built on to the bands, but from reading the reviews it sounds like those break more often.  It doesn't take too long to switch, but if you're switching bands between every exercise you'd probably want to pick up another pair of handles
 - The highest resistance band is not that heavy.  I saw some people mention an orange band at the top end of the resistance spectrum but my set did not include it (or a coupon for it).  I'll probably need more resistance than this set offers for a few things, but it's great for most of my exercises.",4.0
Use it across many different platforms of multi targeted workouts. Absolutely love them. Would recommend for arms and back workouts!,4.0
"I have been using these bands for a few months now, and I like them.  They seem to be high quality, though I'm not an expert.  They have been easy to integrate into my fitness routine.  Any cable machine exercises are easy to adapt to bands.  The bands are compact, and portable.

The only real negatives: The door anchor isn't as useful as it might seem.  You need to have a strong door that closes well, but leaves some space - there is no real place for me to use it in an old apartment that's been painted many times.",4.0
I've been using these resistance bands for a couple of months and really like them.  By combining the various bands you can achieve practically any level of resistance imagineable.,4.0
Yeah you still have to use these things to make the program work.  It didn't work by putting it under my pillow.,4.0
"I ordered the bands for p90x.  They work well enough, and I am able to do all of the movements.  My only problem is that I'm short and can't really get all the resistance I want without using loops.  Fortunately, Black Mountain does offer a free band upgrade (orange, 40lbs).  If you are like me and on the short side, or if you are stronger, I would suggest ordering the orange band; I believe the shipping and handling is free as well.

The bands do start to show some wear after a while, but that is expected with bands.  If you're someone who can't afford buying a set of dumbbells, this band product is a good substitution.",4.0
This resistance band set was my answer to doing my exercises at home.  I had been going to Curves for 12 years but unfortunately the Curves closest to me have all closed. I needed something to continue exercises and going to a co-ed workout place just didn't appeal to me.  ilmiaz,4.0
"I normally workout about 3 times a week at a gym, (mostly weights, with some cardio) and I was looking for some at-home workout equipment that I could use when I didn't have time to go to the gym, but still wanted to squeeze in a good workout. That's why I bought this product, and I've been using it for a few months on ""busier days.""

These are a great alternative to buying dumbbells (much cheaper, and easier to carry with you on trips). I was pleasantly surprised at the build quality and appreciated the carrying bag that came with it.

They work perfect for me at my height of 5'8''.

The only two things that I would wish to improve on this product would be the following:
1) Printed weight labels on the bands so I don't have to refer to a sheet to know how much resistance approximately is on each band. (I simply took a sharpie and labeled them myself, except for the black band. It'd be nice to not have to do it though).
2) The carabiners could be a little bigger, to prevent the need for me to awkwardly rotate the carabiner within it's black cloth attachment to snap in the handles. (Not a huge complaint though, since the price was great!)

Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.",4.0
"This product is very solid. Lots of different band strengths allow for variety in the workout. The only downside is a lack of instructions for basic exercises. The small info included is not very helpful. I had to find and buy a separate book for even basic exercises. I think if they included good info on the 10 most used exercises (biceps, triceps, shoulders, squats, etc.) that would raise the review to 5 stars.",4.0
"I just received my package, and got them out to test them out. Everything from the bands, the carabiners, the ankle strap and door anchor, seem high quality. Inside the package is also a coupon for a free orange band (extra heavy) which they said will ship in 1 day, and arrive in 3-4 days. My only complaint (and it's my own fault for not paying attention) is that for some reason I expected TWO ankle straps, but there is only ONE included. I want to be able to strap both ankles at either end of a single band (or multiple combined bands), for various exercises. So, I'm having to order another ankle strap off of Amazon. Not a big deal, and not too expensive, but with shipping (not a Prime eligible product), it comes out to $8 or so, which is a reasonable percent of the entire package.

Because of that, I set it to 4 stars.",4.0
"I like this product. For the price, it is well made and durable. The only minor issue I have is, the lbs resistance should have been printed one the Band. Would make it easier to know the lbs resisitance that way, instead of trying to remember the color code.",4.0
"I got this a few days ago and started using them as a step into heavier workouts, and found them to be very appropriate. Time will tell about wear and tear but for now, they work just fine.",4.0
The Black Mountain resistance bands have worked very well for the 55 and over group I am training. The give me options for people with limited strength and flexibility. The bands have performed very well and are holding up very well.,4.0
I have used other brands and they all break within a few weeks. These have lasted and don't show any sign of wear.,4.0
"I'm using this to work out my hips for an IT Band issue.  I tried using it for a full workout, but just don't like a resistance band workout for my full body.  But for my hips, the door peice is awesome.",4.0
"The variety of band resistance on this set is nice.  It ranges from 2 to 30 lbs.

Like the quick release on the bands.  Can stack bands to adjust resistance.

I've noticed that Black Mountain sells 40 and 50 lbs resistance bands separately.  I wish they sold a set with these bands included.",4.0
"I received the product as advertised.  At first I was apprehensive about buying the product considering some of the poor reviews like the bands being poorly anchored to the straps.  I did check and I found them to be quite sturdy.  The manual leaves much to be desired though, so researching on YouTube on the exercises is a better option.",4.0
"We ordered a few of the resistance band sets for the physical therapy office that I work at, and all of the patients that have used them, love them. They are easy to use and can be used on many exercises for different body parts. Some of our patients loved them so much that they have bought a set of their own.",4.0
The band work exactly as expected. The only minor complaint I have is the handgrips on my set had some indents in the foam grip that I find distracting.,4.0
"I bought these resistance bands after using a similar style of bands at a health club.  They are easy to use and the resistance
offered by the bands is perfect for my needs.  It is nice to have the whole set even though I am more of a light to medium resistance gal.  I am sure I will get use from these bands for a long time.",4.0
Very useful and quality product. They should provide one or two spare handles which will be quite useful for the price paid,4.0
This product is easy to use.  I travel a lot so it makes exercising fun and convenient on the road.  Great price for everything it comes with.,4.0
THE BANDS WORK GREAT.THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDED ANOTHER ANKLE STRAP SO YOU COULD USE TWO BANDS TOGETHER.,4.0
I bought these bands to use for my P90X workouts and so far I have been well pleased with them. They are of quality construction and seem as if they will be durable. All the hardware and connections seem sound. Everything did together in the handy carrying bag. What's not to like?,4.0
"I bought these resistance bands for my P90x workouts. Product comes with 5 bands that are easy to connect together when needing more resistance and the package provides level of resistance for all bands. I'm planning on buying extra band handles ($8.99 on amazon) to help speed things up when I'm needing to change weight bands between exercises as p90x has some workouts that switch a lot between exercised.

I have no complaints about these bands and I really like how they are easy to combine the resistance bands together with the handles. I wished they did come with an extra set of band handles and this is why I rate it a 4 stars out of 5.",4.0
"The bands are good and they do what you expect. They stretch and then come back. Yay!

It's the little things on the side that I expected to be a bit better for a pricier product in this market. The instructions are just kind of sad; they only show 5 exercises. I'm writing this review because you have to write a review to get the orange band.

There should really be something to help you secure one end to something like a power cage. They could actually just give you another one of the ankle straps and it would work fine.",4.0
This is the second set I have purchased and the hooks for the bands are not as nice as the first set so I am only giving it 4 stars so far. Hopefully they last longer than the last set (lasted about 6 months). But at this price it is still cheaper than a gym membership.,4.0
I have recently purchased this item to be used at home when I am too lazy to get to the club to move the weights.  The materials seem to be well made and I hope they will last for some time.  The fact that there are multiple interchangeable bands make it possible to vary the amount of effort necessary to stretch them which is nice.  There is a simple book of directions which will enable the user to exercise most of the muscle groups.  On YOUTUBE there are video demos of the various of exercise options.  Since it was quite inexpensive it is hard to complain.  It is also very portable.  It does not replace a real workout.  I would buy it again.,4.0
"Love it, it does the job. I haven been doing this at work on my spare time or during breaks. Makes me feel like I get a small work out in the office when I don't have time to hit the gym.",4.0
"Perhaps I have a bad set, but these bands have repeatedly broken on me.  The handles come off from the band.  Today, one of the handles detached mid-exercise.  The band snapped down on my leg which immediately bruised (badly).  I'll be looking for a set that already has the handles attached. (one star)

UPDATE: Immediately after posting this review I was contacted by Black Mountain Products.  They replaced the product.  The replacement will not have the problem described above.  This was EXCELLENT customer service.  Based on that, I will definitely consider and recommend their products. (updated to 4 stars)",4.0
This seems to be a sturdy set at a good price. I bought a set for myself and my wife based on the favorable reviews on Amazon. Used them so far in a few workouts and they perform well. Only gripe that I can think of is that shoulder presses (pulling action from below the shoulder line past the shoulders above the head) occasionally scratched my lower arms during the upwards/downwards motion. The nylon attachment between the tube and the handle is the reason. Need to adjust my motion I suppose and/or wear a long sleeve shirt. Otherwise I would give five stars. Feels quite different working out with the bands compared to dumbbells but I enjoy it. Free orange band promotion is certainly appreciated.,4.0
"Lots of cables and cords. Can mix and match as needed. I use them for p90x in a small house without weights. They give you lots of options, you can affix them to the door, hang them up high, down low, etc. Very versatile.",4.0
works well and comes with alot of extra stuff a good workout for limited space and if you travel. 15min and you can feel your heart rate climb and a good sweat if used right,4.0
"I've been using the bands for a few weeks now and I'm happy with my experience. I've seen results, through using them 2-3 times per week. They're extremely easy to carry around and move, which is great for someone like myself who moves regularly. Unlike dumbbells, I can just throw them in my suitcase and not concern myself. Customer service phone line was very helpful and cordial the only time I got in touch with them.

I can think of only two minor drawbacks: Firstly, that using multiple bands at once can be a bit unwieldy, but it's certainly something that can be gotten used to. Secondly, that I wish the bands had some markers on them to indicate a halfway point or other marker points to make it easier to do exercises that involve standing on them or using another stability tool.",4.0
"this is perfect for what i need them for. i kept reading other reviews of the eyelets breaking or the straps and handles but these seemed to look to be sturdy needless to say I'm unsure of when mine exactly broke but the inside of the handle has a crack, it hasn't broke completely but I'm uneasy of using them on a daily basis so now they're just used every once in a while.",4.0
Can't beat the price for these bands. Comes with five bands from light to heavy. Can stack the bands to add more resistance.  Well made and well worth the money.,4.0
"I bought this 6 month ago to strengthen my shoulder capsules, which tend to get weaker and injured pretty often.  Since I had been in rehab for the body part and elbow before, I already knew how to use this tool, and also was sure that it would work as before.  I wanted to save money and time on physical therapy by having my own training equipment, and I was not disappointed.  After 6 month of continuous workout, almost 3 times a week, now my shoulder capsules don't jerk any longer, and I don't feel pain there.  Having achieved my initial goal, recently I began different routines to tone other muscles as well.

The only issue with this product is that it would have been better if it came with more attachments and easy-to-understand instruction for them.  Sometimes I find myself trying hard to find a way to fix an attachment to the door for a specific exercise, since it doesn't seem to maintain its position.  I still manage to work out, but not in the way I want to for safety concern.  Not that I had any incident, but better safe than sorry.",4.0
"I have used these bands a couple of times since receiving them, and am happy so far.  The attachments are sturdy, and the bands appear to be good quality. The only thing I would suggest is getting more than one set of handles - if you want to switch bands in the middle of a workout, you have to stop, and change the handles over.  Other than that - they're great.",4.0
"just got them at the P17X point, made a big difference for shoulder work. Less strain. Travel lots, so travel bag convenient. Carabeeners work good. Friendly company.",4.0
"In week 2 of p90X we are glad that we have them now.
For 25.00 bucks you get a lot for your money. I wish it came with two handle bars, and the other over the door stopper.

So far so good.
Will update if things tend to happen.

Good bargain.",4.0
"This set is a great value for the price. The bands are strong and sturdy, and the handles especially are well-made, with high-quality yet squishable material and solid metal connecting hardware. I only wish there were a set of handles for each band, but obviously the price would be considerably higher. I was able to get a good strength workout using these bands.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mountain-Products-Resistance-Band-Set-with-Door-Anchor-Ankle-Strap-Exercise-Chart-and-Resistance-Band-Carrying-Case/dp/7245456313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mountain Products Resistance Band Set with Door Anchor, Ankle Strap, Exercise Chart, and Resistance Band Carrying Case</a>",4.0
"I like that you get several band strengths in this package. And if they're not strong enough for u you can combine them. Previously I owned a set of flat bands without handles. i chose this set for its flexibility and the handles and door doohickey. Both were nice to use............
Stay far far away from these things if you have a latex allergy. You may not have to touch the bands because of the handles, but u will have to smell them and breathe in their dust. They smell like hundreds of balloons. I tried wiping them down but that wasn't effective.........
I do like the product but I have to find a nonlatex set.",4.0
"VERY nice, and easy to use - even for someone with mobility problems.  I wish there had been a few more exercises described in the booklet (I'm not very imaginative on my own.)",4.0
I would recommend these bands to anyone in an exercise program. I think the bands work your muscles in ways you just can't accomplish with dead weights.,4.0
I like these bands. Really works well. Just wish it came with some more exercise ideas or a video dvd. But you can just google search for it. These bands get the job done.,4.0

It is very nice exercise stuffs for a good price. This is a second set that I bought from this company.,4.0
"I live in a dorm room. And going across campus to go to the gym during the freezing cold winter isn't something I enjoy. So I use these for a nice little work out in my dorm room.

I wish the cables had a little ore resistance because I think using multiple cables is quite a bother. But other than that, I find them quite useful.",4.0
"Great customer service, quality strong build and bands, very versatile functionality with door attachments. Included limited set of workouts. Would recommend this seller and product, would purchase from them again in the future.",4.0
"I've been using these for a couple weeks, rehabbing an elbow injury.  Good quality product for the price.  The lower pound resistance band's primarily only serve the purpose of being paired with the higher pound resistance bands, but they do come in handy.  The handles are great, a lot better than some other brands i've used in the past.",4.0
"I been using this set for about a week and so far it has lived up to my expectations. Basically I chose this set over the other ones because of the rating and the amount of reviews for it.  When I received the set, I automatically started using the ""black"" band which provides a good amount of resistance for me.  I use this on the days I don't want go to the gym to basically supplement my workouts.  The bands are a good length for me, I am 5'9 and I feel like I can do most basic exercises with this.  The bands feel sturdy and not like they're going to break on me.  However you can use some common sense and if you feel like your extending them too much then just refrain from doing so.  The black nylon bag is feels ""cheap"" and thin, not something I would show off in public but that's just me. Maybe if the logo was smaller I wouldn't mind, however it serves it's purpose for storage.  I have not used any of the attachments yet but when I do I will update my review.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to workout at home for strength training, there are many videos on YouTube that provide workouts if the simple workout manual is not enough for you.  Hope this was helpful.",4.0
"These bands have remained in great shape so far! I have been using these bands for a month now and they have withstood what I have been throwing at them! I use them during my workouts 5 times a week doing exercises my physical therapist recommended. The bands are still in great shape, the door anchor is showing some wear (I'll have to see how well it continues to hold up...). Overall, a great system!!

The only negative is the way the handles have a semi-circular loop where the bands attach. At the beginning I found myself constantly trying to fix its orientation, but just gave up on it. A completely circular loop would have been much better, but this doesn't affect its use in any way.",4.0
"My husband purchased this for him and I, I have been using it for a couple days and I can really FEEL them working! They come with a paper that tells you exactly how to do the exercises from start to stop, I love them!",4.0
I purchased this set to compliment my P90x workout and the Red band (the highest resistance) broke on me and snapped in the middle of one of my exercises. Reasoning was because I had stepped on the band to create a loop and increase tension. I called the company and they immediately replaced my band and also included a higher tension level complimentary for me and I was very pleased by their service.,4.0
"This is my first amazon review but the customer service from these guys is so great I felt obligated to write. I have been using these bands for p90x the past 4 weeks.

Pros:
- can double up bands to add extra resistance
- good price
- takes up no space compared to weights
- will send you free orange (35-40 lbs) band if you call them!

Cons:
- it isn't quite ""instant"" to switch handles for each band between exercises, and with p90x you have to do that frequently especially when you go through two cycles of the same exercises. but they do sell additional handles which i might end up getting.
- I am 5'8"" and I wish they were about 6"" longer, mainly for doing any sort of overhead presses- I fear they will snap regardless of the strength of band but that is also me being paranoid.

If you think you will want to be able to add incremental weights by doubling up the bands I'd definitely get this clip-on version, otherwise I would probably get the ones with handles attached. Either way this brand is a good deal.",4.0
I love these bands. They're well made and I enjoy the easy clip on clip off for swapping resistances. Being a personal trainer it's always a perk to be able to toss all those band types into one bag when traveling to multiple client's houses throughout the day. My only complaint is the tension/shortness of the bands. While they do stretch fine for moves like an overhead press the bands are very tight which makes each band's weight resistance not accurate when doing these moves. This can be a bit of a problem for some of my lady and elderly clients who use the 2-4lb or 6-8lb for almost all moves and then struggle immensely when shifting to a press move or tri-extension which stretches the band to its limits.,4.0
I bought this resistance band set for my husband and he likes it.  He travels a lot for work and wanted something that he could bring on the road with him and these are perfect.,4.0
This is an excellent product.  I purchased for my wife and she loves to use it.  A great workout in a small package.,4.0
"I bought these bands last year and have been very happy with them. They are appropriate length for me (I'm 5'7"") and appear to be well-made as they are holding up fine.",4.0
"These should be in everyones personal gym, I got 2 sets for higher resistance and also for a set for my wife, easy to take along for traveling and very small.  I laugh everytime I look at the pictures in the manual of the little guys doing the exercises but these work great!!  Also give you a great workout!",4.0
I like this product and use it 5 times a week.  It has a lot of different features and exercises.  The only bad thing is the instruction booklet is lacking.  Just a pamphlet really.  Otherwise it is an waesome product,4.0
This product is exactly what it claims to be.  Switching bands is easy and you can add multiple bands at a time for more resistance.,4.0
"Bands are good quality and work pretty well. Since I haven't used resistance bands before some more fool-proof instructions would be nice, but the product itself is great!",4.0
"very light weight.  good attachments for the ankle/door anchor.  very smooth pull. easy to stack up for more weight, but still rather light overall.",4.0
"I have purchased other resistance bands and these are much higher quality than my other set.  If you are performing circuits at home with cardio and resistance training, this is a great way to go.  Also, if you are traveling, you can get a great workout with these.  Some hotels with 'fitness centers' only include cardio equipment and no free weights or machines so these bands are a must if you travel!  The set includes a door stop and ankle band as well.  I recommend getting an additional pair of handles in case you have two bands/sets of bands you want to work with during a circuit but this is not required.

Great product!",4.0
"My wife and I have been using these bands for just over a month now for P90X.  They are holding up really well, with no signs of wear.  It is easy to change out the handles from one band to another or to double up on bands, though it is a bit of a hassle to make the change between every exercise.  Still, I think I prefer these to the bands that you cannot clip together.  Also, there are certain exercises where I need to hold the handles sideways, and the cushion part slides around on the strap portion of the handle.  Not a big deal, but something to be aware of - it would be nice if the cushion part were secured to the strap.",4.0
"Kinda annoying to have to switch handles throughout the workout, but it's a solid, well made product.  Pump it up.",4.0
"I use it with p90x.  Before these, I had bought a pair of golds gym (the cheaper set at walmart).  These are extremely better.  Better quality, more weight, and comfortable.",4.0
"These exercise resistance bands provided a good workout for me.  I gives me other options aside from just push-ups, pull-ups, situps, etc... It's an all-around good product.  Would recommend a better system to attach the bands to the handles.  The current setup can get a little cluncky.  Even so I could still live with it.  Thanks.",4.0
I have recently purchased these bands and am very pleased with them so far.  They come in a nice carrying bag that holds everything together.  I look forward to continue using the bands with P90X.,4.0
"I purchased these bands three weeks ago, and I have been very pleased with the purchase.  They are very good quality and it is nice to be able to adjust the weight as you progress.  I use them with the P90 system and they have been great so far.  Also I travel a lot for business, and with the case they are very easy to pack and bring along.

The bands themselves are much better quality than the bands that you can get with the P90 system.  They are shorter (I would guess around 40-42"" as opposed to 48"") however I am 6' tall and have no problem using them for overhead lifts (Military or Swimmers Press).

The only downsides of the bands are that when I do the overhead press the grommet and carabineer that holds the band to the handle do tend to rub against the arm and shoulder.  However this is a minor annoyance to myself, and the fact that it uses these items is part of it being a much higher quality band than the ones I previously have used.

If I could make one recommendation it would be to get a 2nd set of handles, as it can make transitioning from one exercise at one weight to another exercise with a different weight much faster.

I will edit/update this review in another couple of months, to update the progress after continued heavy use.",4.0
"This is a relatively recent purchase for me but so far so good.  I purchased the bands because I am in the early phases of a new workout and wasn't quite ready to invest in an expensive dumbell set.  The product came just as described and incredibly fast.  The carrying case is great especially as I plan to bring these along when travelling. The small size of the carrying case makes it ideal for travelling.  Only downside with case is that sometimes the bands gets tangled inside but only takes a moment or two to sort out.  I did wind up calling customer service with a question about proper use of the door anchor and the person I spoke with was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  Wish all companies were like that.  The door anchor works well between jam and door.  I'm a bit nervous about using it at the top of the door, not because of anything specific to this door anchor, just my overall sense of the security of these door anchors where there is a slightly larger gap. Certainly don't want it to come flying out.  The quality of the bands themselves seem good.  After reading a few of the other reviews, I am going to start making it a habit to give the bands a regular quick scan for fraying and wear and tear but so far no signs.
One of the other reviewers mentioned that the set only comes with one set of handles.  I, too, found this to be a bit problematic, as I use  a variety of resistance for different exercises and would like to be able to transition from exercise to exercise fairly quickly.  I found the transitioning a bit unwieldy with the carabiner clips and nylon and it was slowing me down.  I have since ordered a second set of handles and that has been helpful.  If you are looking to transition quickly I do recommend this.  I haven't started combining bands yet but I imagine that when the bands are combined the transition would be even slower.

Follow-up
Customer service has been great as I had to get some bands replaced.  In talking with the customer service rep, he was able to identify a particular exercise (lawnmowers) that can place unreasonable stress on the bands if you put the focal point (i.e., foot on band) too close to handle causing an extreme stretch on small portion of band.  That was likely the culprit in the problems I was having.  I really like the stacking function of the band (i.e., combining different bands for more tension) but do get somewhat frustrated as I am trying to maintain a pace to my workouts and it is not always a quick transition and in certain workouts I need to regularly go back and forth between tensions.  It is hard to maintain the pace in those instances.  Multiple handles are helpful - I only have two but maybe three would be better, although would face the same issue if using same bands in different combinations.  Still, stacking function is great and much cheaper than dumbbells.",4.0
"How much can I say - they are well built and of good quality.  I only wish they had come with two pairs of handles so that my husband could use them at the same time (since he is stronger than me and would always be using a different resistance than me anyways).  But I did see that I can buy a pair separately, which I will due.  Recommend!",4.0
"nice to have all in a bag and ready to use
having the different strength makes it easy to move on in therapy
should have noticed that the bands are not covered - but they will last as long as we need them",4.0
"Bought these to use with the P90x videos. These are great for someone who's a traveller and need to keep up with the exercises in their hotel room. Comes with a nice carrying case which is a bonus.

There's only one handle set. The bands are not as long to be able to do all exercises, especially standing up. I am considering buying another set.",4.0
They work well.  I really feel the burn. I use these instead of hand weights and they get the job done.,4.0
"muy buena calidad, era lo que esperabamos para usar en la casa, varios niveles de resistencia para que se adapte a la necesidad de cada quien.",4.0
The product came just as advertised. Easy to set up and use and the bag is nice if you plan on working out when you travel.,4.0
"This bag contains the necessary tools to strengthen all muscle groups. The instructions are skimpy but a couple of bucks will
get you a book on the use of bands. Take a large sheet of oak tag and list the exercises and hang it on the wall. Do the ones you like least the most, these muscles need it!",4.0
"This is a great product and the quality is good.  I like that the set comes with 5 bands and a door anchor which is really handy for doing workouts at home! I dislike that it only come with 1 set of handles, so when performing a variety of workouts you have to unhook and re-hook, it disrupts the workout flow.  Another dislike is that the bands are short, I'm 5'7 and its easy to do curls but tough to do a shoulder press & resistance squats unless I use the very light band.  All in all... it was a great buy, I've modified certain workouts to accomodate the short bands and invested in an additional set of handles.  I would recommend it....",4.0
I have been using it with my P90X workouts (also bought their chin up bar) for about a month now. I mostly use red and black bands and they work great! And the price is reasonable too (compared to buying it from P90X website). All in all bang for the buck!,4.0
They are great for a beginner and give the ability to increase resistance with ease.  I may purchase another set for work.,4.0
"I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set to allow me to do strength training when I travel.  I had previously purchased another name brand set of resistance bands, but they had plastic D rings that would slip under strain.  The metal D rings and O rings on this set is a much improved upgrade for me.  The door holder and foot strap completes the accessories.  The set is easy to use and the bands are strong enough to meet the workout needs.  This is a high quality set or resistance bands.  The only negatives would be the work-out instructions are weak.  I downloaded a more comprehensive work-out guide for resistance bands that have better diagrams and more exercises.  Also, using multiple bands can be tricky.  It would be nice if there was a sleeve that would gather the bands when using three or more for safety and ease of use.  Overall, the quality for the price is outstanding.  I would recommend these to anyone who would like a good quality set of resistance bands.",4.0
A bulky set of cords but very useful for baseball purposes.  I use it almost every day. Great product for all workouts with different weights.,4.0
"I started the p90x workout recently and bought these in lieu of free weights.  I really like them, but the attachment buckle can get annoying when you're trying to do any modified workouts such as anything that requires you to pull your arms close to your body.  The metal buckles chafe a little.  There aren't any sharp parts and it doesn't injure me, but it's the only thing I would change about them.  Unfortunately, I suspect that is also what makes them so durable.  I would buy these again expecially because they seem to be really good quality for the price.",4.0
"Resistance bands are durable and great for the price... unfortunately for a lot of the workouts I want to do they are too short, which is such a shame.",4.0
"I bought these bands a few months ago as a way of diversifying my workout - I'd been a dumbbells and chin-up bar guy until then.  I find the bands to be well-made and sturdy, and I like the design of the clips and removable handle.  It means that I'm dealing with less bulk, of which I'm always a fan.  Plus, because the clips swivel, there's never an issue with ""going against the grain"" that I've felt with other bands.  Ultimately, though, these are better for someone needing a lighter workout than I.  Thus, my girlfriend loves them, but I have limited use for them.  This is probably my own fault, though, so I will get a band of higher resistance from BMP and I think it will have greater utility.",4.0
"Love teh bag it's all organized in.  Makes it very convenient to pack up and take with me.  Good quality, also.",4.0
"I wanted to be able to work out at home on days I can't go to the gym, and I don't have the money or space for a bunch of free weights. Thankfully, my wife bought me this set as an early Christmas present. I've only tested them out a few times, so I can't speak to how they hold over months of workouts, but they seem high quality (comfortable handles, metal clips, etc.). I love that this set is stackable so the resistance can be increased substantially. The door anchor is nice and works well too, so you can do chest presses and pull downs (alternatives for a bench press and lateral pull down). While I don't think they can fully replace free weights for everyone, I'm excited to have something to work with at home that is lightweight, inexpensive, and (I think) effective.",4.0
"The product is as advertised.  The bands themselves are good quality, no flaws, and they seem to provide a consistent amount of resistance.  My only problems have been that they only come with one ankle strap, I would have liked two, and the bag that you see pictured in the product description is extremely low quality, and has already come unbound along its main seam.  Beyond those problems this is a fine product.",4.0
"These are great quality bands, and you cannot beat the price. Have been searching for good quality bands to add you my gym and by purchasing these i got excellent value!!!",4.0
"I've been using these bands for the past two weeks as a part of the P90X workout series.  So far, I couldn't be happier.  The product works great for P90X, and any other exercise I can think of.  My only complaint is that the bands do not have any markings to indicate which band is which strength.  Obviously the thicker bands provide more resistance, but I've seen other bands that have resistances marked on each band.  This is my only complaint so far.  In terms of value, I am very pleased with the price.  I have seen comparable sets priced much higher.  Very happy with this purchase!",4.0
overall bands are useful for p90x and good resistance.  nice that you can combine bands for more resistance.  would have given 5 stars but the black band snapped out of one of the connectors and hit my foot.  since then a bit paranoid that the other bands will end up doing the same.  other bands have been working ok so far.,4.0
"I've had these bands for about a month. For the price, you couldn't hope for anything more. They seem reasonably durable (the lighter resistance bands seem flimsy, but if you only use them in combination with stronger bands, they should hold up fine). Customer service is top notch. A quick phone call got me a free orange band. The handles are comfortable and sturdy and the door-strap makes this a very convenient, very useful set that will hopefully hold up for many months. So far so good!",4.0
"I don't have any other bands to compare these to, but these seem solid.

I like the handles a lot and they have a decent carry case. The red band (heaviest) certainly doesn't seem like 25 pounds, but I use them on and off for p90x, but I don't do them often.

They seem like they will last and I think they had a 3 month warranty, so if you're getting them for p90x (and more dedicated than myself) you could get them replaced if you need to.

The door jam loop for ""pullups"" is great.

If you need bands, these seem like a great deal: Durable and affordable.",4.0
Great item. Would recommend to anyone looking for exercise bands for physical therapy. Not exactly a strength training item but still has some decent resistance.,4.0
"Package delivered on time and was  as expected, while, in my opinion, their instructions could and should be more detailed and a bit more explanatory , I believe that most persons after a few minutes wil, understand. The bands are well madex and appear to be able to withstand a great deal of use. I also think that the bands are a bit too long to give a taller person with longer limbs the necessary thrust and pull that bands can be utilized to their fullest effect.
1. I am satisfied
2. Would recommend to others, especially w ithe the improvements I noted
3. Bands are a great adjunct to other exercises for ALL AGES AND THEYMSUPPLY A RANGE OF BANDS FOR THE NOVICE TO THE BODY BUILDERNJUST LOOKING FOR A  QUICK TUNE UP
4. Took off a star for the instructionscm which if upgraded would make it a 5 star",4.0
Great product the  bands provided work exactly as advertised.  I will continue to use these for travel and other times I do not have my weights handy.,4.0
these are really fun to use and work very well. they are made of strong quality material and none of them have broken so far,4.0
"This seems to be a great set of bands, although I've never owned any previously. No issues with use and I like the attachment to use with the door. Everything appears to be very sturdy. Only thing I've found frustrating is having only one set of grips. It's inconvenient to attach and reattach whenever I need to move from door to floor, which also requires a change in bands used. Also would be nice if the bands were labeled by weight so I didn't have to refer to the book. I'm sure I'll get to know them by color over time and use.",4.0
"I feel like this product is great for the occasional workout use but if you are hardcore and plan on using these on a daily/weekly basis then this product may not be for you.

The bands are a bit flimsy and you need to have the right shoe sole for the band to stick under your feet and stay there. Worth buying for the price compared to actual weights.",4.0
"I purchased these resistance bands on August 31st, and got them shortly thereafter in the mail (it was free supersaver shipping, so while it wasn't the most expedient, they showed up at my door in just over a week). I'd been conflicted between getting these or the Bodylastics, and decided to go with these, and having had the opportunity to use them, I have no regrets with my purchase.

These resistance bands are very well made, and so far, they have met and exceeded my expectations and taken everything I've thrown at them. I love that I can stack them and work my biceps/triceps, or use them to work my quads and other leg muscles (although I've most been using them for golf exercises, for which they are excellent IMO!)

I hope my review helps someone who is on the fence. Give these a go, I've been very happy with them",4.0
"I have been using these bands with P90X for 2 months now.
They show no signs of wear and tear just yet. They also provide as much resistance as you need; just a little if your a beginner or a whole lot if you really want to work hard.
The handles are extremely comfy.",4.0
"I have been using these resistance bands for a month and I have pleasantly surprised with how well they work. I figured they would be a supplement to a more traditional workout, but I have found myself using them as a replacement and seeing results. The Black Mountain bands work very well, the grips are of good quality, they are the perfect width to fit my hands and don't slip, no matter the exercise I'm doing. The Bands themselves are of good quality and have mostly held up to continuous use. The only issue I have is since I mostly use the red band, it has become damaged and I would have liked for it to ship with two ankle straps. Other then that, its a fine product and I would definitely recommend it.",4.0
"I was hoping for a nice set of resistance bands that I could use to continue my recovery from a rotator cuff injury and maintain some tone in my shoulder muscles. These bands are a bit too long for that purpose. The quality of the materials is good ... probably the best that I have seen - the bands are well made as are the clips. Some of the exercises shown in the booklet are not practical unless you are about 10 feet tall. For example, the only way that I could do the  behind-the-back tricep extension is by doubling the band - i.e. slip one of the handles on the band and make a loop with the band. I don't know if it spoils the band using it this way.  The lighter bands are probably not practical for most males unless they want to use them in tandem with other bands which makes it a little clumsy esp for the shortened length that I described earlier. It's a reasonable product for the price but certainly not the deal of the year.",4.0
"The best feature is the ability to stack the bands. The hooks work well and seems well made. The bands give predictable resistance and will provide a good workout. I have not used them alot so I cannot comment on the durability of the bands. I am giving four stars since I have nothing to complain about; I think five stars would need to be granted after extensive use only. I did call their customer support, it is a small company and they do pick up their phone - by themselves, not a offshore call center.",4.0
I have been using these bands for about 2 months now and they are performing as described. The snap hooks to change from one band to another work fine. The padded hand grips are more conmfortable than the ones they replaced and the storage bag is compact and makes it easy to pack them.,4.0
"The resistance bands were more durable than I expected.  They snap onto the handles and you can stack them (ie, put more than one on at a time to increase resistance).  I wasn't aware they could do this.  The attachment that goes on the door is a piece of plastic/knot you thread over a door and close it, creating a sturdy lock to pull from.  I was concerned about it breaking the door or causing harm to the frame but I haven't encountered any problems yet after some frequent use.  Overall I am pretty impressed with the quality of these, for the price.  I wish they were a little bit longer (I am 6'2"" and have longish legs) but they are still a good size.",4.0
"Great product as described.  Seems durable.  I like the carrying case that it comes with, it will probably be very easy to travel with.  I get a little concerned when I do pull-up type exercises with the band snapping, but no issues so far -- I will continue to check the bands before working out to make sure they are in good condition.",4.0
"The BMP Resistant Bands is a great product for resistance/isometric form of exercises.  The resistant bands allow you to tone the muscle groups as well as provide the stretching necessary to maximize performance.  However, I was disappointed in the limited literature provided.  There needs be more illustration material provided to the user that show the various exercises that are available.  So far I am not disappointed in the product as the bands are sturdy and the accessories are easy to use.",4.0
"I bought these after becoming in bad shape from running (too much, on concrete, with inherent leg structural problems, wrong shoes, etc), and had patellofemoral syndrome. I can't run 5 minutes now without my hips or knees hurting a lot. A lot of online sources told me to use resistance bands, and my physical therapist's opinion too sealed the deal.

Thus, I have found myself ordered these from the good reviews. The products are good, but as someone who had never ever seen these before, I admit I was unsure how to use them. The instruction manual wasn't particularly helpful because it shows a single position and what it was called, along with terminology I wasn't 100% sure about. I don't even know which muscles are being trained, or what's good for runners like me. Thankfully, you can go to youtube and lots of online forums to find answers.

But before that, I had emailed BMP asking which exercises were best for runners at both their website and on their customer support email. No answer from either. So, along with no answer and a poor instruction manual, I am obviously questioning...how can they make good products when they don't even answer questions about the product? Not answering implies not knowing, and who wants to buy bands that haven't been tested or seemed to be developed for the purpose?

I'll update if I get a response, and I've only used this product several times since it came in. I like them so far, so 4 stars for quality, minus 1 for terrible customer service and a terrible instructions manual. Example? Along with these bands, came the door anchor and ankle strap. No labels or either. How do I know what is what? The instructions for using both were a mess. I can't ever see myself using the ankle strap either, mainly because I don't know if the way I put it on was correct or not. The door jamb was slightly more obvious, but it seems so crude. Just a strap with a ball on the end that you slide under your door and close it.

Update, same day: just got an email from the reps (he was on vacation). I'm so happy!

Here are some things that look good: ""In the future we plan on upgrading our brochure, making videos, and posting information on our website. But as a small family owned business, we can only move forward on a few things at once, due to expenses and overhead. Our main priority at this time is to improve our quality of our equipment which we work on daily. Also, besides YouTube, I often recommend The Great Resistance Tubing Handbook: http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Resistance-Tubing-Handbook/dp/1926534522. The book has many great tips and exercises for a fair price. Lastly, to care for the bands, always inspect the bands before use. Always check for imperfections, cuts, tears, or abrasion. If you see anything please contact us as we warranty all our bands. When using the bands, always try to work out on thick carpeting or an exercise mat. Thin carpeting or concrete floor can cause severe damage to the bands. Also, watch the shoes you wear when stepping on the bands. Shoes with lots of grip or that are worn outside can also cause abrasion to the bands.""

Don't hesitate to contact them! Thanks BMP! :)",4.0
"I got these bands to use with Tony's 10 minute trainer videos. They're not quite as good as the ones he has in the videos (mainly cause there isn't a waist belt to strap them onto). This is the first time I have used resistance bands. They work well and seem like good quality. I will say, its much harder to keep good form using bands (rather than weights/dumbbells) but you use a lot more muscles at the same time.",4.0
"started using these bands several weeks ago and getting use to not using free weights.  the versatility of using bands vs free weights gives the me the opportunity to utilize them anywhere,unlike clunky weights.  Still getting use to the different feel that you receive from the bands. As time goes on I will update my experience for others to consider.",4.0
"I've been using the resistance bands for about a month now and I like them.  They are easy to use, and can be used in combination for any incremental resistance that you want.  However, if you are going to use them for a variety of different exercises, it can be a little time consuming to adjust the tension by clipping and unclipping the bands to adjust the resistance.",4.0
"When I bought the previous version that had the swivel clips I wasn't to keen on using it too much. But now that they changed to standard carabineers instead, I decided to buy a second set, which I use more regularly. Also I recommend getting the new extra strength orange and purple bands, sold separately. I would say the only drawback may be is that the bands, all bands not just the two mentioned, are a little short for some people, and probably best suited for people in the 5'4"" to 5'9"" range. I'm not saying people below and above that range shouldn't get a set. Let me just make it clear the height range I gave is not a concrete standard. It's just an opinion as to how I feel. I'm 5'11"" and I'm very careful how I use my bands. Black Mountain is a very good company with awesome customer service, and they're always working on improving their products. For the price and some common sense usage it's tough to find a better basic set than this. My previous swivel end set is a souvenir I keep in my closet. I hope they come out with a new set the has all 7 bands, 2 ankle straps instead of just 1, 2 sets of handles that are bigger than what they have now, a door anchor with a cushioned liner, and a really nice bag to put it in. If and when that comes out I'll be getting that for sure and ready to post a 5 star review.",4.0
"I have used numerous bands, like rip cord, ones they have at the physical therapy office, and others. By far these are the best i have used. They are easy to clip on and off. They are extremely strong. The handles don't dig into your hands. I would recommended theses to anyone who wants to work out with resistance bands.",4.0
"I have used the resistance bands for a couple of months and have been very happy with the product.  The bands are very easy to use.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is, like other users, I would have liked a nicer workout chart.  Other than that I would highly recommend this product.  The handle are very comfortable and you get plenty of bands.",4.0
"The bands are really great as far as being able to switch up the amount of resistance. The foam around the handles is comfortable to hold. The information that comes with the bands helps to determine which combination you need for the amount of resistance you're looking for. I'm using them in conjunction with P90X and they're working out very very well.

The only thing I have had any issues with is the area where the caribiner/clip is attached to the handle is slightly abrasive and rubs my arms during some of the exercises. It's not breaking the skin or causing any lasting scrapes, but it's not the most comfortable feeling in the world. My only other (totally superficial) complaint is that my storage bag ripped the second time I took the bands out. The seam seemed to be held together with adhesive rather than being stitched. I simply replaced it with my own bag. That obviously hasn't affected the utility of the bands in any way.

Great product!",4.0
"These resistance bands are pretty high quality, and they're certainly worth the money you pay for them. They flex well, and seem to show no signs of breaking/tearing. I'm satisfied with their quality. If I had one biggest complaint about them, it's that you cannot really get too much weight out of them. In order to get to ~60lbs of resistance, you need to link up three different bands. Admittedly, with bands you can always just create more tension to get more resistance (by creating a loop on the floor; look up videos on youtube if you're curious) instead of just attaching more bands, but I don't like putting that much strain on my bands. If you're expecting these bands to turn you into the Hulk, come back down to earth and rethink what you're buying them for. If you're using these to put on a little size, tone, or to supplement your use of heavier dumbbells/machines, then I'd highly recommend these. I'm using them for P90X, and I have no complaints. Occasionally it takes some effort to figure out how to reach the right amount of resistance for a new workout, but they always pull through for me.",4.0
"I bought these resistance bands to use along with P90x, and so far they are holding up well. It's been about 2 weeks since I've started using them and none of the bands have broken yet (as some reviewers have mentioned). I don't yet know how they will hold up in the long run, but I'm not too concerned about them since Black Mountain Products has a great warranty on them.

They come with 1 set of grips that attach to each of the bands via a metal clasp. If there isn't a weight that you like in each of the bands, you can combine multiple bands and customize the weight yourself.

I really like these, and assuming they hold up - I give it 4 stars.",4.0
"I have never used resistance bands before, but purchased it to use with EA Active for Wii.  For me, this is a high-quality product and the handles are comfortable.  I do enjoy using free weights - it has a different feel - but can't use them with Wii.  Occasionally, the bands get in the way when I used them, but that probably would be true for any resistance band.

I've used the bands for a couple of weeks now and they seem to be of high quality - no tears or 'white' stress marks.  When I'm done with them they store nicely in the bag and stows away.",4.0
"These bands are made of strong, high-quality material. And I like the door attachments. But I'm 6-1 and find the bands too short. However, there is a workaround. To increase the band length, simply add a carabiner in between the handle and the band. Also, the color-coding is confusing. Instead, they should label the bands from 1 to 5.",4.0

I do with the heavist of the bands (red / orange) could be longer. I do some exercises that require standing in the middle of the band and there is just not enough length (or strength from me) to extend as far as I should.

Overall, great.",4.0
"I bought this set about 4 weeks ago for P90X.  So far, I am very happy with the set.  They provide a large range of resistance, but are also able to accomodate small changes.  Also, the ability to quickly change the bands is a great feature.  I know that any sort of dumbbell set, with this range of resistance, would cost 5-10 times this cost.  Also, Black Mountain's Resistance Band set was a much better value than any other similar set I could find at the stores.
That being said, I am still getting comfortable with excercises that I need to shorten the bands.  I have had some success with wrapping it around my foot, but there are times when it is still awkward - especially when using multiple bands together.  I assume I will be able to modify and tweek this in the future - for comfort and a better work out - but I am still working on this.
All and all, I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others.",4.0
"I've used resistance bands from a number of companies over the years, and these are some of the best I've tried. My girlfriend and I have been using them for a bit now, with no issues whatsoever. The clip-on system makes it fast and easy to not only switch bands, but combine them as well without being cumbersome, which is nice for workouts where you're in need of multiple levels of resistance. All of the components and accessories seem to be of very good quality (the handles are comfortable to hold, which is not always the case with resistance bands), and the value for the total package is excellent (the door anchor is great for pull-downs when a pull-up bar isn't an option). Plus, they're manufactured by a small, family-owned company -- you can't beat that.",4.0
"I ordered these bands for two reasons:  Hit muscles that I could not target with free weights; Simulate a cable weight system.  They work perfectly for the new muscles, and well enough for the cable simulation.  The issue with the cable simulation is that with a cable system the resistance is constant through the entire range of motion.  With the elastic bands resistance goes up linearly with the distance stretched, so with a movement with a large range of motion it can be hard to complete the motion if the initial resistance is high.  The workaround is to do those sets twice --- once with low resistance at the beginning and a full range of motions, then a 2nd time with high resistance at the beginning.

Recommended.",4.0
"These resistance bands are a great tool for home workouts.  We're paddlers, and I wanted something that I could use for strengthening my rotator cuffs in the winter.  So far they're great...I bought a set for each of the family!  My only concern is that where the bands go through the loop for the door jam, it is pinching the band.  So far no problems, but I've only had them for a couple of months.  I'd definitely recommend getting a set!",4.0
"These are definitely worth the very reasonable price tag. They work perfectly when tied against a bed, dresser, or door.
It's very easy to change out the bands (fast clips) and when you combine the bands in the order they suggest (included resistance pamphlet) you really do get a good deal of resistance.

My one complaint is that the bands are a little longer than  I would have liked. I know many bands allow you to hold them hand to hand around your back and do push-ups with added resistance or other chest exercises. I'm not a small guy and these bands are too long for me to get any resistance hand to hand around my back. It's not a big complaint, more of an annoyance and I guess the length has it's purpose somewhere else.

These bands are durable, have comfortable handles, include a door and poll mount and a carrying bag. These are a great bargain, and still worth it.",4.0
"Product is as-described/pictured.

Was a little less strength than I thought (but that's my own fault for just not being familiar with resistance bands in general).
Still should work alright for basic excersises and toning.

BUT... BUT BUT BUT...
I hate being tall. 6'2"". These bands are not reeeally for us taller guys. YES, you can use 'em and I guess get the same effects....ish. But you'll face resistance sooner in your motions than other average-lengthed individuals. I also tend to have orangatang-lengthed arms. Like a freakin' pteradactyl. Again, these bands are not designed for us.
You'll face resistance sooner in your motions, and thus you'll have to use lesser-than-other-anticipated weighted-bands and just do more reps to get the same effect. This logically means stressing the bands more (though I've only used mine a few times, and thus haven't witnessed this yet and so am only theorizing based on the feel of the bands when I use them and my gut feeling).

BUT: They're well-built. GREAT price. And come with neat little carrying pouch and instructions for about 10 excersises. I just wish their directions gave more explanation (or visual depiction of your body) as to which muscles each excersise is supposed to workout (primary, secondary).

All-in-all, great product for great price. If I were an average-sized human, I'd probably have given it a 5-star.",4.0
"I recently purchased this set of resistance band in order for me to use them with the insanity asylum/p90x hybrid.  while other people were complaining about how cheap they were and how they break, they seem to be holding up pretty well for me.... for now.

The Customer service person (Justin) not only found one but is sending it to me free of charge. I emailed them on Thursday and expect to have it by Monday. I expect to get the replacement blue one a day or two after that.

The other bands have been fine, and based on the other reviews I don't expect to have problems with these. In any case Customer Service has been awesome and a little unexpected based on other customer no-service experiences.",4.0
"I purchased this set of exercise bands to replace a very old set.  I love the fact that it came with not only a door stop, but also an ankle strap, which really expands the usage you can get out of a set of bands.  This set includes one set of handles that can hook into any one of the five different colored bands very easily.  I use these when I travel for business when it's not easy to get to a club.  I find them very useful and they are very well built.  Highly recommend them to anyone looking for a way to maintain your workouts.

I ordered the bands for P90X and for when I'm traveling. I've used many of the bands several times and they seem great. I guess time will tell if they hold up. Easy to add and remove bands to change the resistance. Great quality and work great so far with P90X.,4.0
"I bought these bands to use with P90X2 in order to modify some of the workouts. Ive found them to be very useful for this, particularly when used with the door attachment. Using the bands with the door attachment offers an effective alternative to doing pull-ups that still provides a good workout. They can also be used fairly well as a pull-up assist band, although the resistance is a little low to be completely effective in this manner. I would recommend them if you need a easy, portable option for an upper body workout.",4.0
"The bands are just as promised by the seller, they are good high quality resistance bands with all the needed attachments and allow you to quickly and easily transition from one exercise to the next (possibly even quicker than with an actual weight gym.) I ordered these bands to be use for the P90X videos and I was a bit skeptical at first because I didn't think that fitness bands could provide a good workout - boy was I wrong. By grouping the bands together you can increase the weight resistance to a very high level and provide a nice fluid resistance training session.

"I am currently in college and the work out room is always busy. Often I have to wait before I can even use the equipment. Due to this I work out in my dorm room.

The diverse strengths (colors) of the bands offer the ability to work all muscle group to the max.

I looked at several types of resistance bands and this product offered the most variety of resistances, good quality hardware, accessories and a handy carrying bag. We use them pretty often (several times a week) and it's fast to switch bands and change resistances allowing multiple people to use one set. The only improvement I would suggest is maybe a little more padding on the handles, but they are still really comfortable to use. The clips feel really solid, much better than other kits that I have seen. Also, for the price you really get a good, versatile workout kit.",4.0
They seem strong and well made.  Good instructions!  Just lost them (husband unpacked them and they were found later).  Quality bands and company!!!,4.0
"I am new to using resistance bands so take this to mind in understanding that I was not quite sure on how exactly to use the door anchor and ankle band.  Sure it has a paragraph explanation but I really just needed more to make sure I was doing it correctly.  Wish also that they illustrated more than just 6 ways to use the bands, a nice wall chart demonstrating a few more with a bit more detail would have been worked nicely.

 The resistance bands themselves are very sturdy, they look to be extremely well made so that I am not fearful of them breaking or coming apart.  Overall a lot nicer set than I expected.",4.0
The product is well made and seems to do as advertised.  The only thing missing is more instruction on workout routines.,4.0
"I am currently stationed in Taji, Iraq and needed to get some weights or bands to continue with my P90X.  Since these resistance bands didn't cost to much to ship I decided to do the bands.  The bag they come in is a little flimsy, I have already torn it, but it does get abused.  The bands are good and the door and leg attachments work well too.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I didn't realize that there was only one set of handles.  I have to keep changing the handles when I change bands and it makes sharing the bands impossible.  So far so good though, they seem to be well made and put up with loads of abuse.",4.0
"These B.M.P. exercise bands came in on time, were a great price, and I am very satisfied with the product.  The bands clip onto the handles, allowing you to pull them through and double them up.  This is useful to double the resistance, especially when the band length is too long without doing so.  The bands are very durable and have different intensities for the workout.

The only drawback to this product is that they could include a more extensive instruction booklet with more exercises.  The instruction book is one photocopied page with about six exercises explained.  Despite this limitation, this is a great product for the price, especially if you know how to exercise with resistance bands already (or have a different book).  It's s family-owned business that is very responsive on the phone as well.",4.0
"The bands are very well made I have been using them every other day for over a month and there is no sign of wear, they are long enough to give a full range of motion, the sheet of exercises were a little hard to understand do to the lay out on the page, but after a few minutes they became clear.
Over all I'm very happy with the product.",4.0
"Out of the package the information was concise. I like the ability to increase resistence by attaching additional bands to the sturdy handles... I was always torn to just use the strongest single band available in the past - now with the easy detachable multiple bands, i now have the 'choice' and a better chance to make 'strength' changes.

"If you have ever worked with TheraBand or other types of elastic bands, the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set represents a major upgrade.  Very sturdily made,  very easy to vary resistance by either changing or combing bands, and very easy to vary the angle of resistance by sliding the door anchor up or down.  You really could use this for a complete home gym.

The instruction booklet offers very little in the way of suggestions for workouts.  It's a single 8.5 X 11 sheet with all of six exercises illustrated on one half of one side.  Unless you already know how you plan to use these bands, I would suggest getting another booklet.  I bought the Great Stretch Tubing Handbook on Amazon and it was worth it.  I have a torn rotator cuff and it includes specific exercises to strengthen it.

An ankle cuff is included with the tubes with no suggestions how to use it, nor are there any exercises shown that use only one hand, necessary for rotator cuff strengthening.

One suggested improvement: the tubes are passed through a loop in the fabric door anchor.  That is, the nylon fabric is doubled back on itself and sewn, creating a loop.  I think it would be easier to use if a D-ring, such as used in the ankle cuff, were sewn into the door anchor.  This would make it easier to pass the tubing through it and also easier to fasten one end of the tube to the door anchor when using just one hand.

Finally, a nice drawstring bag is included that holds everything.  Take it all around, a good buy.",4.0
"I had never used resistance bands prior to this purchase, but this set has been easy to work with.  During my workout it is easy to change bands out from exercise to exercise.  I also like the carrying bag which really contains everything to a small volume in my closet.",4.0

I am probably not renewing my gym membership now (I never did much serious free weight lifting anyway) and these bands are also great for travel. They take up no room at all.

One thing: The instructions that come with the product are not very helpful. I recommend going to YouTube and searching ""resistance bands"" plus the muscle group you are looking to work. Lots of tutorials on there.

Overall very happy with my purchase. Seemed like the best deal for resistance bands on Amazon.",4.0

"I ordered these based on the good reviews and have not been disappointed.  The resistance bands themselves are well-constructed and seem to be very durable.  I have only had them for a few days, but their quality construction is impressive and I believe that they will provide high performance for an extended time period.  I am very pleased with this purchase and would not hesitate to buy additional merchandise from Black Mountain Products.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mountain-Products-Resistance-Band-Set-with-Door-Anchor-Ankle-Strap-Exercise-Chart-and-Resistance-Band-Carrying-Case/dp/7245456313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mountain Products Resistance Band Set with Door Anchor, Ankle Strap, Exercise Chart, and Resistance Band Carrying Case</a>",4.0
"I can't afford the adjustable dumbbells just yet, so until I can, I'm stuck with resistance bands.  They're 1/8 the price and can work just as well in some instances.  These bands have held up for about a month now, but I'm starting to notice some slack in some of the bands and my black band has begun to develop micro tears.  I don't know if this is from my stepping on them to increase the resistance or just from wear and tear, so I won't fault the brand itself so much as make an observation.  I have used other bands and prefer these of all the bands I've tried.  Good amount of resistance from light to heavy and sturdy, metal clips that won't come undone at the apex of a rep, (had that happen before and slam into my foot... not fun).

So, for under $30, these bands are worth a shot.  I'd recommend them to anyone who can't just yet afford the adjustable dumbbells, but as soon as I can, I'm switching over.",4.0
"After using the bands, I have found them very useful.  They come with a nice anchor to be used with a closed door.  In addition, I found the versatility of being able to add multiple bands a nice advantage.",4.0
"Excellent product, does what it's intended for and has great hookups for alternate stretches. Not much else to really say though, so far my experience with them has been great, and my girlfriend gets a good workout on them too.",4.0
"I ordered these bands to compliment the P90X program.  I've started using them before the program and couldn't be happier.  Bands are very durable and hold up well.  The door anchor is a nice addtition as well as it allows a larger set of exercises to be performed.  Apparently they also have a lifetime guarantee should anything happen to the bands.

My one complaint would be offering higher resistance bands (or a seperate package that includes more high resistance bands).  You can always group the bands together, but it would be nice.",4.0
I picked these up after reading the good reviews and I am not disappointed.  Seem very well built and are easy to use.  I really like how you can just throw them in the included bag and take them with you where ever you go.  Makes it nice for those weekend trips.  I would recommend purchasing these items.,4.0
"I travel a lot so I bought these to do P-90X on the road. They pack tightly in the bag that's included so they take up very little room in the suitcase, and they can be used in any hotel room. I really like the ability to combine multiple bands to get the right resistance, and the resistance is high enough for most men while doing P-90X. They seem durable, and I'm optimistic they'll last a long time.",4.0
"I want to say these are really nice quality and they will do any job you have in mind for a band. I like how you can add them together to increase the weight resistence. I would recommend them to a friend, the customer service is great, and they are exactly what I was looking for. The only reason I gave them a 4 out of 5 stars is because the foam on the handles was a little messed up but I can live with it. Go with these bands, you will love them!!",4.0
"I was looking for resistance bands for Chalean Extreme since I do not have the space for a large collection of hand weights or the money for Selecttech weights.
I decided to go with these bands since you switch them between one set of handles and can be doubled up for additional resistance.
These are very easy to transfer from one band to the other and really do work well for upper body resistance exercises.
My only complaint is that because of the way they clip onto the handles, when doing an exercise like a fly or chest press when laying on the floor the bands seem like they are too long and they're difficult to grip under the clip to make the bands a little shorter.
These are a wonderful product for an exercise like Chalean Extreme and fit nicely into the provided bag so you can put them away when you aren't working out if you live in a smaller space or be able to easily throw them into a suitcase to take them with you if you travel.",4.0
"I have been using the resistance bands to do P90x for 2 months now. So far they seem to be working well. They are strong bands and can handle the amount of pulling you do in P90x. I bought them because I could not afford to buy free weights and I needed something to be able to do the workout. They work well and give a good amount of resistance to feel a burn. I like how easy it is to get more resistance, all you have to do is make a bigger loop in the band leaving less to pull. I would recommend these bands to anyone that cannot afford to buy weights or is looking to save money. They are easily worth the amount spent on them.",4.0
"The bands came as described- no missing pieces.  The bands themselves appear to be of fine quality.  The handles could use a little work.  They are not functionally deficient, and although I have used the band for one month without the handles deteriorating, It looks like they might be the first to go.  I was impressed by the quality of the clasps at the ends of the bands.  The fabric quality/stitching appears excellent and the clasps make adding and subtracting bands very easy.  It would like an option for a package that includes a second ankle strap.  I find switching an inconvenience and would have rather paid a few extra dollars not to have to deal with this.  I would purchase products from this company again. The cost was modest enough that when bands inevitably break, I won't feel bad repurchasing.",4.0
"Just got them and havn't used them too much, but so far everything seems in good working order. If I could change anything I would include heavier resistance bands and make them a little longer. Other than that though, everything looks great.",4.0
"I bought these bands because of the previous reviews, scoring, and competitive price.  The bands are well made and sturdy.  The clasps to the band are metal and fabric/grommet that lead from band to handle are heavy duty.  I like all the tension options that are available.  The handle seems a little light compared to the rest of the construction but maybe I am just used to using metal handles in the gym instead of plastic w foam.  All in all, I'm impressed.",4.0
"Great product for the money. Have been using these daily with an exercise program, and they are holding up well. So much better than carrying lots of weights around!",4.0
"These bands are great. They are durable and very stretchy. Haven't had any problems with rips, nor were any of my bands damaged when I received them. The carrying case is a bit large, but it leaves room for me to put things like my water bottle and towel in it too. The only gripe I have is, which hasn't really become a problem yet, but the handles that come with these bands are a little lacking, but I hope not. Let me explain. The handles are made of plastic, and covered in a thin coat of foam padding. I understand that lightweight handles may be desired, but they don't feel sturdy enough; When there is a lot of tension on the bands, I'm not usually worried about the band snapping, I worry that the handle will slip, or snap/bend. They haven't failed, but that still doesn't mean that they won't.",4.0
"I have used bands for a few months regularly, and I was looking for more to provide me more flexibility to have bands packed for travel or having bands at work. These bands appear well made, and I have been using them a few weeks. They come with some written suggestions for exercises that provide a start on how to use them. Some might find a DVD more helpful, but I already had one from my other set. These bands use the opposite connection system as my other set (i.e. bands clip to handles) and that detail escaped my purchasing decision. They also are shorter than my other bands, which makes them fine for a conventional bicep curl, but too short for some of the shoulder extension exercises I like to do. So it would be nice to know the starting and extended length at the rated resistance. Overall I like them, and I like the flexibility to customize resistance by changing the number and color of bands. An extra set of handles or the option to add more handles to the order would be nice too.",4.0
"These bands are a great quality item.  The addition of the door and ankle straps are wonderful features.  The company ships quickly and is very customer oriented.  My only criticism of the product would be the starter guide.  It's nothing more than a sheet of paper with a couple of exercises on it.  I think they could add more to it, and link to video exercises on their website.  Overall though, I would recommend them to anyone interested in purchasing exercise bands.  For the price and quality they can't be beat.",4.0
"I purchased these bands to use with P90X.  They seem to be well made - I did not feel like they were going to break while I was using them.  The handle can slip making them a bit uncomfortable to use, but that doesn't prevent them from doing the job.  I had never used bands before, but they were much cheaper than buying more dumbells....after a while, I decided I liked the dumbells better.  However; these are GREAT for when I am traveling and want to workout on the road.  I would highly recommend taking a Sharpie Marker and writing on each band the resistance level because unless you use them everyday, you won't remember which band is which.",4.0
"I have been using these bands for about 2 weeks with P90X and they are the new 2011 version.  I have been very happy with them and the clipping system works very well to add additional levels of resistance.  Also the Door Anchor works well to do pull-ups.  The quality of the bands seems to be very good, but i did have a problem with the black band getting a nick in the rubber tubing in both ends of the band.  I called customer support about this and they said this should not happen even if you have to step on them to do some of the moves for P90X.  They have agreed to send me out a new band and were very helpful. Even though I had a problem with one of my bands I would still say this are good bands for the money and would recommend them.",4.0
"Bought these bands for P90X.  Had a tough time deciding between these and bands that each have their own handles on them.

Pro: The reason I went with these was to be able to stack extra weight together for more resistance.  For areas where I am stronger it is nice to be able to put 2 or 3 bands together to get the desired resistance without paying an arm and a leg of lots of bands.

Con: You do need to sometimes switch bands depending on the exercise, so be prepared by having them laid out in in easy area.  You can try and use different size loops to use 1 band for a super set of exercises.

Overall they seem very sturdy and well designed.  I do wish they were labeled by weight, since I am colorblind I sometimes grab blue instead of green.",4.0
I bought these because I don't live near a gym.  They are great for helping me built some strength to go with my aerobic excercise that I get with my elliptical.  I love working on my biceps with these.,4.0
"I am very please with this product.  It is very sturdy and a great value! I bought it specifically for use with the P90X program, when I injured my elbow early on doing pull ups. This has been a great alternative, as it is much easier on the elbows and you can add bands for additional resistance as you move through the program.",4.0
"Great bands.  As a free weight lifter myself 5 days a week I needed something to take with me traveling.

Pros:
1. bands are very durable
2. hooks on bands are great.
3. enough weight for the average to slightly above average lifter for 10-12 reps
4. Great for the money and beginner (even with a new door anchor)
5. Compact bag is great that holds everything.  Easily fits in even the most packed suitcase.  No excuse for not working out while traveling anymore.

Cons:
1. The material they use for the handles are very rough (not the part you hold onto but that holds the handles and hooks). For intense lifting scraped knuckle raw.  With gloves you will be more then good.
2. The door anchor is a joke! Number 1 complaint by far. Highly recommend you purchase an additional one for 10-12 dollars more with a big base. Trust me if the door is even slightly looser it will snapped back and it hurts! This was a hotel solid door that it snapped back so not even a hollow inside home door. And yes I double and triple checked that it was solid behind the door but when you are doing multiple reps and pulling at full resistance the door anchor can move to the wrong position.
3. They use a half moon ring for the handles for the bands to snap onto. A little annoying cause it will not stay in place. A round ring would work better.

Ultimately this is a great set, minus the door anchor, for the money. I would highly recommend them for anybody looking for a portable gym. With my travels, hotels only provide treadmills typically but the lifter is left out.  Great way to keep up with your workout or mix it up.  It can be a fun way to workout also if free weights are unavailable or you do not have a spotter.  Again BEWARE of the door anchor!  With exception of the door anchor the other cons are not that big of a deal. Just being detailed, by no means urging you against these since they are very good for the price.",4.0
"My husband purchased these for a fitness program we are both doing (P90X).  The products seem to be well made, and I appreciate the storage back that was included.  I am eager to support a small family business as well.  Obviously, they are lightweight, compact and affordable.  I'm sure that we will make use of the bands when we are traveling, but for home use we decided to switch to weights (the expensive Powerblock) for several reasons.  (1) It was hard to get appropriate resistance in certain positions (hands near the ankles for a dead lift from a squat, multiple lunges across the room).  (2) It is more satisfying to see tangible progress with weights (15 lbs last time, 20 lbs today), than with bands (blue to green, or worse, small loop to big loop).  (3) Changing the handle between the different bands takes up time, and we had to pause the video while we fumbled around.  It might be worth getting a set of bands that has a handle for each band.

However, if bands are right for you, you will be well served by this set.",4.0
I bought these bands specifically for P90X and so far there hasn't been any real problem with them.  I have been using them for about 3 weeks now and they are great because you can customize your resistance better than any other bands I've seen.  You can connect any of the 5 bands to the handles to create a perfect resistance.  I would recommend these bands for people who are into harder workouts like P90X and lighter workouts.,4.0
"I was looking for something that I could use at home and easily take to the gym. I bought these bands about three weeks ago and am very pleased with the quality.  The bands are very high quality and the carrying case works great for throwing everything into my gym bag. I only wish that it came with another set of handles or that BMP sold the handles individually because sometimes I am constantly changing the bands back and forth. Overall, I would recommend this set of bands to anyone looking for a good set of resistance bands at an affordable price.",4.0
"I purchased these resistance bands primarily for travel and for times I wouldn't be able to access my gym.  I've found they're very versatile once you figure out what exercises you can do with them, and they've provided perfectly adequate workouts for someone used to free weights and cable machines.  I gave the product four stars primarily based on the lack of instruction that accompanied them - the included booklet has very sparse directions for only six exercises, and in my opinion doesn't provide a very clear explanation of how to perform the exercises or how to use the extra accessories.  I would recommend a website like [...] ([...] is a good example) for more detailed guides on resistance band workouts.

The resistance bands themselves are great!  I'm only 5 feet tall, so I didn't have any issues in terms of length when performing exercises that required you stand on the bands.  When using the door attachment or wrapping them around a pole, I did have to experiment before finding the best way to position myself; I found that standing with my legs in a staggered, lunge-style position provided the most stable base for exercises like a standing chest press.  Also, positioning the bands overhead using the door attachment allowed me to kneel or sit in order to perform lateral pulldowns.  The door strap has proved to be extremely useful, and I haven't had any issues with its sturdiness.  I've used it with door frames that are quite old, and if anything I would advise users to make sure the door you use reliably stays closed.

The interchangeability of the bands is definitely one of the biggest selling points of this set.  I really like that each band has its own attached clips at each end; it makes it faster to change resistance, which is important when you're doing a circuit with limited rest between sets or moves.  You can incrementally change resistance by adding or removing multiple bands, or by shortening the amount of slack you allow at the beginning of an exercise.
I also like that the handles are padded - I imagine using the bands would be uncomfortable with hard handles.  The size of the handles is perfect for me, but I'm a fairly petite girl, so for a guy with large hands they may be a tight fit.

I'd definitely recommend this set if you're looking for a good basic resistance band package.  For someone looking for heavier weight, the guide indicates there is an additional orange band you can purchase that goes up to 40 lbs.  This set fit my needs as is, and I'm excited to find more ways it can enhance my fitness repertoire.",4.0
"I like the fact that you can stack the bands quickly. It makes for a good fast paced workout. The materials and construction seem to be of high quality, but time will tell. My only gripe... I have large hands and I wish the handles were wider.",4.0
"Works well for the requirements of P90X so far. My husband has used them solely for the workouts and uses them ""hard"". No complaints. The pull-up bar is also well put together and has withstood 100's up pullups on the doorframe so far. I like the cushioning on it much better compared to the ""walmart"" brand one I bought for myself.",4.0
"Bought these bands about 10 days ago to use for the P90x training program. They are a great low cost solution for the program as they are much less expensive than the P90x bands. I haven't used any other bands so I have no frame of reference as to quality and design but it would appear that these are fine bands for what they are meant to do and I wouldn't imagine the p90x bands are any better. If I find that these break easily or wear down after a bit I will definitely get in touch with the manufacturer/seller as they are warrantied for 90 days, which is exactly how long I'll need them! Customer support and shipping were both excellent as well. Good buy overall.",4.0
Excellent product for the price. The clips give you the option to use many different tensions and options for using the handles. I have seen better products but at two to three times the cost.,4.0
"Purchased this to use to draw attention to our product line.

"We use this at work for our spinning wheel. Great for attracting people to the table to spin it. It's solidly built, easy to spin, and weighs a decent amount.

The only flaw is that the screw sometimes pops out after a while. It gets loose from the wheel shaking. You may want to tape it in, or super glue it if you won't ever take it apart.",4.0
It was an entertainment at my family reunion.  I loved the dry erase and it was easy to put together.  Lot of fun for prize giveaways.,4.0
"Love this spinning wheel. It's sturdy, smooth to operate, very easy to assemble and disassemble for storage. The colored wedges are a pain though. You need to print them in color (pricey) and then cut and glue them on precisely. It was a process. But it only needs to be done once. I used spray glue and that worked well - no bumps or lumps. Overall, the quality of this wheel is great, much better than some I have seen in use and it really works to attract people to the booth. People of every age love to spin the wheel!",4.0
Works really well for the events i do for work. Its Sturdy and seems that it will hold up well for a long time,4.0
The wheel was a great purchase. I did exactly as it was supposed to do and worked great for me although it was a little off on it's balance so it kept rolling back to certain items. We worked it out though and put it on it's side. Worked great after that.,4.0
Solid wheel. Gets the job done and doesn't feel like it's going to break in 5 minutes. I feel like all the wheels I found were a bit overpriced but this seemed like the best value.,4.0
"Prize wheel is fantastic and sturdy, good size, quality everywhere except the center insert which arrived with bubbling all through the plastic that covered the art. I managed to pull it off so now there's a plain white circle instead of the black spin graphic, however if anyone else is ordering this item you may want to prepare yourself for getting a slightly damaged product.",4.0
"Very fast shipping - some areas of glue exposed, rough wooden edges and not level, but not THAT bad to warrant less than 4 stars",4.0
very nice for the price not high end quality but it will get the job done in a storm not recommended for long period of use but enough for the occasional user,4.0

Not what I expected kinda small but I like it serves it's purpose.,4.0
"I like it, but the handle is tiny. I have to place the ring on my middle finger so I can have my pinky off the blade. If I use my index, I have to contort my hand into an awkward shape.

4 stars because I've never found the perfect cleaning kit and for stars because it is closest I've come to perfect,4.0
this gun kit is nice. the case is cheap plastic but it seems to have everything you might need. others have said that the plastic rods and the plastic end pieces are delicate. I haven't yet seen it in action but I have a Winchester kit myself so it couldn't be any more cheaply made then that one. that one cost less.,4.0
good product for the money  I do like all the plastic rod tips.  Includes most necessary items to clean a large of fire arms.,4.0

A good gun cleaning kit with everything needed to maintain by guns. Would recommend to friends who might need a gun cleaning kit. Nice sturdy case to keep track of all the parts.,4.0
Basically it includes all of the items you need to clean most rifles and pistols. I have used it regularly with no problems.,4.0
Has everything you need except cleaners and lubricants. Has a nice storage box. They could have included some cleaning ideas and instructions,4.0
"Like: Very large selection of items for most caliber fire arms. Contents seem to be made well.

Dislike: Case is not the quality that I expected, seems cheaply made (flimsy).",4.0
"Most notable is that it doesn't contain everything you might need and it is missing some calibers that are not entirely uncommon --- there is no provision for .40 for example.

The individual components are not made of the strongest materials, but then you don't have to worry about any of them damaging your rifling. It is a really nice size overall and the container is pretty good. Some items may shake loose into other parts of the case, but they never fall out entirely. The extra room between some of the items is also pretty good for storing hex keys and what-not.

The lid latches very securely on both sides and the rods snap very securely easily in and out on the top. Everything in the bottom is loose.

Not the cleaning kit for the connoisseur; but a nice economic kit for the hobbyist that has guns in a number of different common calibers. Pretty good for under $30.

(Also, the shotgun mops and brushes are actually on opposite sides from the picture; obviously not a big deal and since they are the same size they can pretty much be re-arranged but the mops are actually bigger and have slightly larger slots in the middle. If you try to make it match the picture then the mops might smoosh a little)

Thin rod to thick rod adapter (required for the .22) you could possibly use the thick rods to clean a 22 but it would bump against the edges of the barrel for sure. Adapter is aluminum so not incredibly tough.

A decent add on kit to add to all the kits I have been buying from the 60's. Most tips are metal and used the plastic ones carefully and they are so far working well. For the price per part it is a good kit to have if you have many different guns to clean.,4.0

Bat and ball are super soft, which is great for my young kids not to get hurt as well as making it easier for them to grip. The bat is not extra wide or anything, so for my kids, they will have more success hitting off a tee. I do like that the bat and ball look like big kid ones because they aren't extra fat.

"I got this at a hobby town USA store for the same listed price, and You will get what you pay for! It took me awhile to find plastic on the frame. All of this is metal except the body. The frame and cross-members are aluminum as is the transmission and transfer case. There are no plastic gears what so ever in the Gear Boxes. The axles are cast aluminum and look just like the axles on a 1979-1985 Toyota pickup truck. The front has ball join steering knuckles to make them more robust, and they are VERY strong unlike the Axial scx10 with its plastic everything. The Pumpkins on the axle are smaller than that on the scx10 which allows for easier crawling and not worrying about getting hung up on rocks. The leaf springs are metal as well and are very well designed. The shocks are really nice and internally sprung to give it a more ""scale"" look. The wheels are very nice stamped steel with great tires that look very real. The body of the truck is hard plastic instead of lexan like on the scx10. This means it is strong and fragile at the same time. Over all it's a great truck! Better than the 90% plastic scx10. Must buy!",4.0

Pros:
-it just feels so good
-looks good
-it seems small when you first take it out of the package but pul the string and fill it up with something and it doesnt seem small and actually fits items well.
-jam things in there and it will hold, managed to get everything left in my locker at the end of the school year in it.

"These Disney play sets are a huge hit at our house.  They're small (think poly pocket size, 2 - 3 inches) have a variety of characters and are fairly durable.  They're bath friendly, sand friendly, and living room friendly.  And compared to other plastic type toys like these that we've bought, these hold up well.  The heads don't break off, the clothes don't tear, the colors are vibrant, and the dolls are recognizable and fun.  Some of the figures can have kind of funky painting (on the features - it's sloppy - and it's hit or miss if it's good or bad), however that absolutely doesn't seem to bother anyone at our house except me.

We love that there are ""good"" characters and ""bad"", that there are horses and animals and a variety of characters in the packages (we do love our princesses), but it's nice have so many different characters.

We will continue to buy these sets.

I would also like to note that the prices of these toys from Amazon are ridiculous.  As of this writing, (12-13-12) this same set, normally 19.99 at the Disney Store, is on sale for 2 sets for $20.  The Deluxe sets, normally 24.99, are on sale for 12.50.  This same sale happens multiple times per year, but even when not on sale, the normal Disney Store prices are half of the Amazon price of $40+.

The product is wonderful.  The Amazon pricing is ridiculous.",4.0

"Since I was looking for 1/4 inch drive impact sockets in both Metric and SAE, this review will be the same for:
Chicago Pneumatic SS2114 1/4""Drive 14 Piece Metric Impact Socket Set
and
Chicago Pneumatic SS2010 1/4""Drive 10 Piece SAE Impact Socket Set

In looking through Amazon, there seemed to be a few very good choices in the 1/4 inch drive size that had good reviews.  What pushed me to the Chicago Pneumatic sets was the fact that they have every socket with no sizes missing (12 mm seemed to be commonly left out and was a thorn in several reviews).  When the sockets arrived, my first thought was of the sturdy plastic box - both that it is far stronger than most shipping boxes and also that it could be much smaller.  Opening the nice latch on each of the boxes revealed a specific spot for each of the sockets.  I would imagine that someone could cut the lid off the box and use it as an organizer for the sockets in a tool cart.  The sockets themselves are well made - perfect machining on the outside with some minor burrs and slightly off-center through holes (1/2 point off the score).  Instead of a smooth interior to the square drive area, or machined in divots, each socket has a hole drilled through so it will work with pin retention, the little ball or a hog ring.  The remaining 1/2 point deduction comes from the size marking on the sockets.  Each socket is both laser marked and stamped - which seems perfect.  Except that the stamped mark is rather small for my eyes and the laser engraving which has the potential to be excellent is mostly used with a big CP and a little size marking.

In the end, I will live with the (could be better) size markings, be happy that all the size increments are included and look forward to picking up the Chicago Pneumatic 3/8 drive size version of these sets.",4.0

"I bought this for my 4-year old to take his lunch to preschool, based on his teacher's recommendation that this type of lunch bag was the easiest for kids to use. He loved the lunch bag when he received it.

The bottom compartment (7""x2""x4"") has room for a juice box and a small banana for example, but not too much room for much else.

The inside is thickly insulated and food safe, suitable for children 3+, but be advised of a strong plastic smell. I'm hoping it will dissipate some after cleaning and airing it out.

The colors are bright, the image on the front is very cute,and the piping around the edges will help it keep its shape. However, I was disappointed in how thin the printed image was - I really don't know if it will last the whole school year. I found the quality of the Marvel brand lunch bags at Target to be overall superior - they are larger and the printed on-images are much thicker.

Overall though, if your child needs a small lunchbox, to fit in a tote bag or cubby, it's about right. The quality is Ok but not great but at this price one can't complain much.",4.0

It's almost every bit as powerful as the corded Bulldog, and works great for smaller size holes. Combine this tool with a Makita impact driver, and you've got an ideal cordless solution to driving Tapcon fasteners into concrete and masonry. The part of the tool that accepts the battery is mounted on rubber to insulate the battery from vibration, and feels a little bit too loose. The battery still can vibrate against the tool itself.

"I bought this tent a few years ago for my triplet nieces and nephew's 3rd birthday and they loved it! They still play with it, so it is durable. The tent is brightly colored and has handles for the kids to hold onto as they are lifting and spinning it. There is a lot kids can do with this parachute: make wind and bounce balls on the top of it as they raise it up and down, make tents/forts, drag each other around on it, and lift it and run underneath, and the kids can come up with some more fun ideas to do with it. This is really something that works best with more kids, so there is a teamwork element to it by lifting it in a synchronized way. The parachute is lots of fun on rainy days and is small enough to where you can use it indoors.

As much as the kids enjoy it, I was disappointed that the fabric was thin and I could see it easily ripping, which is why I'm giving it  4 stars, as well as that it had a strange chemical smell when I first took it out of the box.",4.0
Sturdy and fun.  My two year old likes to sit on it and get pulled or bounced on it.,4.0
"Fun bright colors, wears well with young children. One of the few toys that easily fits back into its carry bag.",4.0
"My kids and the rest of the kids in the family love playing it however i do wish it had better material. The first day my niece grabbed onto the handle and a piece of the parachute (material) together and her little nail cut a couple little openings on the material, and now im afraid that  with the force of the parachute being swung up and down it may make thw parachute rip faster since it already has little hoes, its not that bad but you Can tell. I just had to show my niece how to hold on to the handle itself and not grab the material. Overall, as long as the kids enjoy it, im fine with it",4.0
"This is a well made parachute. It has 12 handles, but lots of space for little hands to hold on to the edge also.
It smells a bit chemically, but I am assuming that will go away quickly.",4.0
"The parachute was made of a stiffer plastic than the parachutes I see at schools which are softer and more fabric-like.  It works very well though, as me and my 2 year old were able to lift it successfully while tying a 3rd end to a doorknob (motherhood makes you a little like MacGyver lol)

Great for the price, and good to use at birthday parties!",4.0
"Quality is good, but not as durable as I would like - we have a two inch tear in the fabric - but we did use it a bit rougher than intended. My hubby was dragging 3-4 five and six year old around on it through the leaves in the yard during a birthday party. I would recommend it for toddlers, and young grade school.",4.0
"The playchute is durable and my son and his friends have so much fun running under it, getting lost in it and curling up on it when tired!",4.0
This was a lot of fun for my daughters 2nd birthday. The kids loved it. I do feel like the handle could be a little more secure but they held up through the party with no breaks so I was happy!,4.0
Good toy for the kids to enjoy active play. We used it at the beach with a group of kids and adults. A little small but still fin,4.0
"Wish there's a bigger sizes available. Though it could provide shade, it would the best if its waterproof when there's a sudden shower at the park or open atea.",4.0
"It's a parachute, but it's also so many other things!  My daughter loves to make tents with hers.  It folds up small, and is much more hands-on and imaginative than other toys.  Nice to have when other kids come over to the house (birthdays, family gatherings, etc.).  Good buy!",4.0
As I said - this is just what we needed or were looking for. The kids will enjoy this for years to come.,4.0
Great for preschool kiddo's.... they love to play under it on it  and with it.  Great size for 8-10 kids,4.0

"I received it within 3-4 days of ordering, which was a very pleasant surprise. The toy itself does have a smelly powder on it when received, but it's okay after washing. Very interesting colors and patterns on it. Kids I've used it with seem to enjoy it and I really like it as well.",4.0
Perfect for a small group of about 4 kids.  Great indoor or out.  HANDLES are a must have!!!,4.0
"Got this for my 4-yr old son to bring to his two sets of cousins' houses.  It definitely intrigues the kiddos.  It would be better with more mature children (5+).  Smaller ones just want to run under it, but it's a worthy purchase even for that.  Very happy with this parachute - seems very durable.  Glad for the storage bag also.  Look forward to using it other places and when my son and his cousins (and friends) get a bit older.",4.0
"Got this item for my daughter's daycare! Great price, it was shipped here rather fast which was nice for the kids~ I have not heard any real complaints about it!",4.0
"I bought this for my niece for her birthday, and we had loads of fun with it. Not too big so if you only have 3 adults you can still get the effect of the chute. Kids love playing and running under it while it falls.",4.0
"Love the mesh bag that stores the parachute; it was easy to fold the parachute and place back in bag.  There are handles, which the product description fails to mention, but are good to have.  Seems sturdy enough.  Good size (not too big or small).  Purchased for party play activity.  Children were excited to play with it.  Overall, good value.",4.0
"My daughter, who is 3, loves this parachute! The day we received we brought it outside and enjoyed it with the neighborhood kids! Would love the option to buy a CD with it for activities/music to go along w/playing w/parachute!
Seems very sturdy, solid construction and handles. Great size!",4.0
"I bought this for my nieces and nephews and we use it at birthday parties.  The kids love it, and it is surprisingly durable.",4.0
"As a grandma, I've given two 6-foot parachutes and thought they were too small to be exciting. So for this 4 year old, who had loved the big parachute at nursery school, I bought the 10-foot parachute. Caveat: It's too big to spread out in any room in a 1920s townhouse. Gotta be an outdoor toy -- unless they use it to make a hideout.",4.0
"I remember playing with the large parachute when I was in grade school in PE.  The entire class had such a good time!
I purchased this for my 5 year old godson and his 3 year old sister for Christmas.  Now, it's not as much fun with just the two of them, but when the neighbor kids come over, their mom brings it out.  That's when the fun begins.  It's amazing how long a piece of material can keep a group of kids entertained!",4.0
Instant hit at six months. Big smiles. It's light and floppy and sturdy--my 10-month-old has been chewing on it for 4 months and it's held up well. The red/white/darkbrown contrast and simple expression are engaging. Definitely a standout from other plush toys.,4.0
The sock monkey is a much loved toy that has stood the test of time.  Our grandson loves him.  Great stuffed toy for a boy.,4.0

This was a great gift for Men in my family thay loved it!!! It has a beautiful picture on it!!,4.0
"All in all this is a terrific Canoe and I love the Peach Seed Amber jigged bone. In all I currently have four Case knives in this jigging pattern.  What sets the Canoe apart is the blade etch of a Native American paddling a canoe.  The CV blades are also a nice touch.

This would've been a five star review with the exception of one little glitch.  The knife had a significant issue with the small pen blade when I first received it. It would slide over when the main blade was opened and prevent then prevent the blade from closing.  My choices were to send it back for a refund or send it to Case for repair.  I opted to send it to Case and they repaired it right away. (By right away, I mean 4 to 6 weeks turn-around time)

In the end, I'm very satisfied with the knife and also the service provided by the seller on Amazon.  The problem was a factory defect. It was not something the seller could have anticipated.  Had they checked out the knife before shipping it to me, I would've complained that the knife wasn't new.  Case made the mistake at the factory.  These things happen and as Case has a life time warranty, these things get fixed.

So one star off for customer aggravation on what is otherwise a 5 star product and 5 star service.  If you collect Case knives, then you know what you're getting.  USA quality at a USA price.

Can you get less expensive knives of the same quality. Yes, but they want be American made.  Can you get a better American made knife, than a Case.  Absolutely but not for a lower price. And if you look around, the best prices on Case knives, tend to be right here on Amazon.  You can't beat that with a stick!",4.0
"This is a good little knife. It is little, I'm a woman with medium size hands and it fits inside my palm. It has synthetic handle scales and stainless steel blades. my only complaint about the knife is the blades are pretty hard to open. I think oiling them would help.. over all its worth the price.",4.0
good fit and finish.  small blade dull.  large blade not centered but not rubbing.,4.0

"Product works perfectly as a water cooler for our team practices and games. Just wish Rubbermaid offered it in a variety of colors - so it could match our school colors. Otherwise, it fits the bill.",4.0
Cooler is what you need for your crews in the Texas summer. Twist on lid keeps dirt and dirty hands out of the water you need for hydration.,4.0
Works well as Alton Brown turkey brine container up to 20 pound turkey.,4.0
"I bought this for the guys to use in the shop.  Each morning I would put chunks of ice in it that I had froze the night before in cool whip containers.  It kept the water cool all day and is a nice size depending on your usage.  The only downfall I can see is the fact that the lid is often nearly impossible to remove.  We always leave the lid somewhat loose to allow for air, but if a large amount of water is taken at one time removing the lid can still pose a challenge.",4.0
"Sturdy enough. Top is easy to remove.  I have seen no leaking issues so far, whatsoever, and it gets some pretty harsh use.  The handles are on there good as well.",4.0
"I purchased three Rubbermaid 5 gallon water coolers for use with our running group.  We use them every weekend and haul them all over the place filled with water and/or sports drink.  My only complaint is the lids will leak even if they are screwed down correctly and tight if they fall over.  If you don't put the lids on right, they will also leak while hauling them about as the liquid splashes inside the container.  The lids sometimes take a time or two to screw on correctly as the threads don't always line up correctly the first time.  Insulation is ok, about what you'd expect from a cooler like this.  All in all, very pleased with the product as it has held up well over the last year of being hauled all over the place.  One last thought, make sure you unscrew the lid slightly when you're ready to use as it will sometimes create a vacuum which will keep the spigot from flowing.",4.0

"This is a great set for kids under 15.  With older kids and adults with long arms, you can almost do finger rolls into the basket; so if you are expecting a replica basketball set like in amusement parks, this set is smaller.  However, all we did was change the rules so bigger kids shoot from farther back. problem solved..

As mentioned by someone else, we also had a problem with the electronic score keeper not keeping score.

It does fold quite nice and is nice for my youngest's smallish room.
I would recommend.",4.0
"We live in an apartment until I finish nursing school, so we wanted something replace our son's over the door basketball game that he LOVES but not something that would take up a whole lot of room.  This was a perfect choice!  My husband used better quality hardware to attach the bracket to the wall because the ones that came in the box looked very cheap.  Our son was completely surprised and LOVES it, BUT the balls are real mini basketballs and the backboard is thin wood over a hallow backing so it is VERY, VERY loud.  It is comparable to someone repeatedly kicking a wall over and over again.  It is not friendly to those who are trying to do other things in the same room or in the room next to it.  I cannot find softer balls to replace them, so I am likely going to be using the balls to create a pattern and sew our own.  I also find the plastic leg very cheap and I am sure it will break before long, but it will be easy to replace I think.  The wood doors are quite thin as well and are not real wood, so I am in hope they will not get bumped or they will likely crack.  Overall, LOVE the concept but it seems like someone cut a lot of corners in the quality of the product.",4.0
"I've had this now for over a month and absolutely love it. Was worried about some of the other comments -as far as the rim breaking however, haven't had any issues. Maybe they have reinforced it or something since those reviews. Anyways, fun to play -and looks good too. Kids love it and we play all the time...even my 2yo loves it. I would recommend getting nerf or softer balls if you have a little one playing...I lost a few glasses from the balls bouncing around..haha.",4.0
Our son loves it and kids in our neighborhood are lining up to play.  Wanted an electric basketball game that didn't take up space and this was the ticket.  I made one ajustment to hold the stand where you shoot in place.  The scoring never misses a beat.  Amazon has the best price with shipping.,4.0
"Great space saver. Pretty sturdy. Comes with 3 balls to blow up, Looks very nice on the wall. Drawers fold shut to appear as a cabinet. Would recommend for younger kids. May not be sturdy enough for teenagers, Great for my 11 year old and his friends,",4.0
"This B-ball cabinet is nice, fun, and will keep the kids entertained.  My wife wanted it as a family gift for the holidays after she'd seen it at someone elses house.  The thing only has a 90 day warranty and a 30 day warranty on the electronic scoring unit. That seems a little sketchy, but so far I have had no problems with the Park & Sun functionality.

Installation was difficult.  I was forced to go to Home Depot and purchase a high end ($30) stud finder to ensure the unit is mounted properly on the basement wall.  With the stud finder, installation was time consuming.  The biggest issue was that the directions say drill a hole using the 1/16 drill bit.  I stripped several of the screws that came with the Park & Sun because 1/16 is way to small.  I learned the hard way that you need to use a drill bit that is just a little smaller (visually) than the wood screws the Park & Sun comes with.  Using the prescribed size drill bit called out in the directions took up most of my time.  The cabinet was relatively easy to level.

Overall, I do recommend this product.  It took me about 3 hours to install altogether.  I am a father of 2, not the least bit handy.",4.0
Good product especially for the price. Mounts easily. Well made. The electronic sensor is accurate.,4.0
"Overall, this has been a great product. You can't get a better deal considering the price. My only qualm is the screw that is used to attach the rolling part of the balance board. It gets loose pretty easy. If you don't make sure to tighten the screw throughout the time you are using the board, the cylinder you balance on will get loose and eventually collapse. Otherwise, I recommend this board because you don't have to pay $100 bucks or over to help improve your balance.",4.0
Grandchildren love it - good exercise and fun. I had no idea what this was - ordered it at my grandchildrens request.,4.0
"Fist off, when I was going to buy an inexpensive balance board or build one myself. This balance board is better than I would have built it for myself, but not as good as I hoped, but I wouldn't call myself a beginner. This board would be great for beginners!

The good: easy to assemble, possible to do some advanced tricks (shove-it, manual with the roller, and much more), many good exercises can be done (my reason for buyin this item), and as I mentioned -- good for beginners.

The bad: the roller is made out of wood and it isn't waxed or smooth. This causes some friction between the board and the wheel that is noticeable and actually makes a grinding noise. With limited success I have waxed the areas that are creating the friction. Be careful I you do this to not wax the surface of the wheel that holds the board on top - you will cause the wheel to slip out when balancing at harder angles!

Great for what I bought it for, but quality of wheel could be improved.",4.0
"I purchase this for my daughters who both ski and race.  We have put this in front of the TV and both have used it for at least 30 minutes a day instead of sitting and watching TV.  We love it!  The coaches of the ski team always compliant the hip movement and balance of them.
This board has seen heavy usage and yes the wood wears down and slips.  I do have a solution and it works well.  Go to Lowes, Home Depot, etc. and purchase anti-skid tape.  Purchase the thin 1 inch wide 2 foot long tape...similar as what is on top of the board.  This is less than ten dollars.
For the money a great investment.",4.0
"I ordered this board because in the picture it showed it with the roller. The roller was not included. I want my money back

My mistake and apology, expected roller to be as shown in pic and knew that it could not fit in the flat box so I did not even open it and send it back. Sorry again, product works just fine.",4.0
"This is an addicting activity. Great for balance, core strength, leg toning and just plain fun! The only problem is the fact that the groove in the bottom only allows the board to go back and forth. If I had known how much use we would all get out of it I would've sprung for the more expensive indo board. Nevertheless this is a great product & I recommend it.",4.0
"So it's definitely not top quality stuff, but thats why its $40.  It does work though and its a great way to experience what balance boards are like.  I have had mine for weeks now and use it everyday and I use it hard.  I snowboard so I wanted something to train with in the off season.  It has held up well so far and I not only balance on it but do tricks as well.  This board has a spine, so, if you want more of a challenge and the ability to do tricks like spinning the board on the roller just flip the board upside down and you have freedom of motion over the roller.  This board is hideously plain looking so I sticker bombed it and now its ready to shred.  Once this thing wears out I will probably upgrade to a higher end product, but for $40 it was a great way to find out if I would even use it, which I do, and to get decent practice.  Tried doing kickflips which was tough considering the board is pretty fat and heavy and doesn't have kicktails. I started using a skateboard deck on the roller instead which is a lot more fun, but I kept the original board for newbies that come over and try it out.",4.0
"This balance board is well worth the money.  Yes there are more expensive versions out there, but they all do the same thing (challenge your balancing abilities). I use this whenever I am looking to fill gaps in the day when there is not much to do and the swell is not kickin.  Regardless, good product with a fair price.  Plus it is made in the good ol' USA:)",4.0

"We recently used a friend's bongo board and wanted one of our own. This one is nicely priced, but the roller seems a little lacking. It is just a bunch of circles cut out of plywood with square spacers in between. It works but it is not totally solid and you just need to be sure to tighten things up.",4.0
"This balance board is half the price of the others and worth trying out before investing in the more expensive model. My daughter is 10 and LOVES it.  Even my 60 year old father gets on it when he comes over. I agree with some other posts that the roller is not made well, I could see it will get worn out quickly. I suggest using it on a carpet.",4.0
"Our first one came with a busted plastic corner, so the frame fell apart when it was opened... which sucked to find out Christmas morning.  I sent it back Dec. 26th.  The replacement took way longer to get then I feel it should have.  It arrived Jan. 4th. It was still shipped 2nd day, but for some reason didn't GET shipped for a long time, even though it said it was in stock.

The build quality isn't quite as good as the two my parent's still have from my grandparents... the plastic corners make it tougher to shoot the carrots in the pockets. I highly recommend using pledge or a furniture polish on the surface to get it extra slick.  I never had cue sticks growing up, we always flicked them with our fingers until they hurt.  I tried the ""wooden dowels"" called cue sticks.  Not really a fan.  Back to finger flicking for us.",4.0
"First, this is a fun idea.  We live in an apartment and this is great for indoor fun.  It doesn't take up much room and doesn't make any noise.  It was easy to put together and fairly sturdy.

My 8 year old daughter was VERY excited to play with her new balance board (a Christmas present).  It took a little getting used to, but after about a half hour she was able to let go of the chair she was using to steady herself.  As soon as she started to feel really confident, she lost her balance, fell off and fractured her wrist.

Of course, this could have easily happened on the school playground or elsewhere.  I *will* allow her to use the balance board again (not sure when), but I will be watching even more carefully and we'll talk about how to fall safely.  I'm also considering full-body bubble wrap!",4.0
"This board is just like the one that my brother and I enjoyed when we were little. I got it for my grandkids and nephews to play over Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. The only disappointing thing was the shooters. They were just 1/2 inch dowels, not tapered at all and the rubber covers wouldn't fit over the ends. I was extremely unhappy with this. The picture of the game shows the shooters that I remember from childhood.",4.0
"Good game hours of fun.

Good game lots of fun",4.0
"When I received it firstly, I have a little worries about its sturdy. 3 round and 4 small square planks combine together by a long screw, which is all the axle. The rim of the axle produce sawdust and a little noise when it works. But after some days's use, it is good. I have tried to do some actions on the board. The board afford me easily.",4.0
"I got my balance board a couple of weeks ago off of amazon. The assembly is really easy and you can play with it almost instantly. I thought that it would be very hard to balance based on other people's reviews. In  about 30 minutes I was able to ride it easily on smooth flooring for as long as I liked. I was expecting it to be more challenging and give me more of a workout, but I still really like it because it is so much fun. So far I haven't found any flaws in the board, but I haven't had it very long yet.",4.0
"The board and cylinder have been designed pretty well.  The cylinder is made up of discs that are held together with a long bolt with washers.  I would have preferred a more solid piece, but it is ok.  I would recommend this product to others to improve balance and coordination.",4.0
"This is a basic balance board.  It's somewhat roughly cut and very simple.  However, it does everything it needs to.  They're quite fun.  It's hard to justify $40 to $50 for this if you are somewhat handy with woodworking tools, just make your own...",4.0
"I purchased this for my boyfriend who's a longboarder, and he found it challenging and fun. It was easy to put together. Not quite as nice as a more expensive one that I had tried out elsewhere, but its a great value. You probably can't do as many tricks w/it as a nicer one, but we're not nearly that good anyways. Not great for little kids I would assume.",4.0
"I bought this for my five year old and my thirty five year old husband! They both really like to stand on it and are getting better at balancing.  They snow ski and skate board and so I thought this would make a great practice gift for them.  It is a little (long) for my five year old to negotiate on his own, but with someone standing by, he does a great job on it!",4.0
"I ordered one of these for my granddaughter because I had enjoyed the same thing so much when I was little, and also because I saw it as a way she could amuse herself without constant parental involvement.  But as it turns out, it's not the same.  At 5, she enjoys it but can't manage it by herself without falling off; she can only do it while holding both of her father's hands.  When I finally saw her using it, I understood why.  My old balance board had a solid wood or hard rubber cylinder, like the Indo Board, and rolled freely even on a rough stone surface. The cylinder on this one has three wheels made out of apparently unsanded plywood, which don't roll freely but kind of lurch from side to side, so that it's very difficult for a small child (or grandmother!) to manage without falling. Unless your family is more athletic than mine, I'd recommend going for the higher-priced one. I would have revised my rating downwards, but this program won't let me.",4.0
Almost as good as the one in my childhood.  The Plastic rails don't fit well,4.0
"We don't have small children around to enjoy this game with, but we both remembered playing Carrom as youngsters, so bought the game for the two of us.  We're in our middle 60s, and tend to be home-bodies except for that occasional night out - once every 1 or 2 weeks.  This game has provided us with hours of fun, laughter, and light-hearted competition;  when there's nothing on TV we care to watch, to kick back and unwind after a long, stressful day, to enjoy while sharing our prospective days after work before a late dinner, while enjoying an appetizer or a toddy.

We've had our Carrom Game Board since the first of March and use it a lot, I mean A LOT! So far it is holding up very well. Construction of the board is overall, very good - considering the cost.  It is lightweight, easily stores under our bed, and seems solid enough to hold up well under regular use, but not abusive use.  The pockets are OK:  they are flimsy and could be a bit deeper, but they suffice and are holding up well thus far.  The board is double sided, and comes with all the components (rings, dice, pins, tops, etc.) needed for the various games that can be played - 100 of them in all! The board, in fact, seems exactly the same as it was when I was a kid back in the 60s, except that the red and green Carrom rings are made from good quality plastic instead of wood (some of which would crack and break after continued use, so perhaps the plastic will be better).  The board also comes with a small 41-page official rule book, which outlines the various versions of Carrom and other games that can be played.  While the rule book is vey handy (rules are well written, easy to comprehend, and a few diagrams are included), the print is pretty small, so you might want your reading glasses handy.

WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED:
Although doable, the two sticks to be used as cue sticks leave a lot to be desired, in our opinion.  They are simply lengths of unfinished wooden dowel common to craft and hobby stores.  Both of the wooden dowels that came with our board were warped - one beyond use!  Small scale, shaped (narrower at the shooting end) wooden cues with a little more weight and  a finish  would have been a lot nicer and made the game more enjoyable.

Whereas the green and red Carrom rings are adequate, the white shooting rings could be better.  They should be weighted, so that they pack a little more punch upon impact, to get the colored rings into the pocket.  I don't have as much force behind my shots as my hubby, especially the long shots.  Also, when having to use more force for longer shots,, the shooters sometimes fly right off the board because they are so lightweight.  However, we solved this problem by hot-gluing a nickel in the center of the shooting rings - top and bottom (covering the holes).  This gives them good weight, and packs just the right amount of 'oomph' for shots, once you get use to them being heavier and adjust your shots accordingly.

Also, I purchased a large lazy Susan that I set the game board on when we play.  We can sit on stools while playing, and swivel the board around for the desired shot.  This not only makes it great for persons who get tired of standing for long periods or who have back problems, but for small apartments or areas of the home that are cramped.  Hubby holds the board steady for me, while I take my shots, and visa versa.  Works great!

BTW - Earlier this year I had tried playing billiards with hubby in our apartment's community game room.  My shots were so terrible that I felt too embarrassed to ever try again.  Shortly after that, I ordered this Carrom board, because the game was similar, and also because I remembered how much fun it had been as a child.  Playing Carrom has proved good practice for me; I'm much better at getting my rings in the pockets than I was when we first got the game, and even win a fair amount of games.  Hubby says that I'm ready to try billiards again; I agree and feel confident enough to give it another try.

All in all, the board is good quality for the cost, and we're glad we bought it.",4.0
"I bought this product because it was the least expensive balance board I could find. I'm hoping it will improve my balance and also prepare me for learning how to snowboard (I've read elsewhere that it is supposed to be good training and strengthening) So far I absolutely love it. It is a GREAT workout, and it doesnt seem to get boring...even though its basically a piece of wood on top of a cylinder lol

I did have a few problems... When I first ordered the board, the one that came was defective. The screw in the cylinder part was stripped, and when I was on the board, it kind of um... fell apart. BUT, it really wasn't a problem because when I called the customer service number that came with the package, they sent me a brand new board and cylinder completely FREE. And the new one is built sturdy and is fine. Another problem is that the board I'm using is starting to appear somewhat warped...it doesn't lay flat on the floor anymore... this really isn't a problem as far as performance, but I'm wondering how long the board is going to last.

A few recommendations:
1. DO NOT use the balance board on any rough surfaces, it will ruin the wood of the cylinder.
2. The board is best on a smooth surface...wood, vinyl, tile, cement, or a very thin flat rug. It moves too slow on carpet.
3. Be prepared that the first time you use the board you might feel a bit dizzy lol I did at least... but it goes away the more you use it and the more comfortable you get
4. Start off holding on to something lol otherwise you may go flying... But again as you get more comfortable it becomes A LOT of fun... Some people can even do tricks with it... No clue how lol but that's what Ive heard...

So overall I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who is looking for strengthening/training in balance, a good workout, or just some fun. Even with the minor problems I've had, it is still a great product and a lot less expensive then other balance boards out there.",4.0
"This is well-made and sturdy, from solid wood. It's trickier to balance on than the one I used in P.T., probably because the wheel is larger. It will take a few days, but if you keep trying, you'll eventually be able to stay balanced for 30 seconds or more. My grandkids love to try it when they come over, but they're not as good as I am--yet! Should be good for the ""core"" muscles.",4.0
"Every once in a while, there is some extra friction between the roller and the plank. Probably some sanding will take care of it. No problems with delivery. Pretty much like I remember it from my teenage days, in other words, great exercise and not too easy...",4.0
"The board was easy to put together.  It has been in constant use.  It is a fun activity for everyone in the family.  The board has few parts so it seems to be holding up fine.

The board arrived in a timely manner following the order.  The one thing that bothered me was that the website said the item might not make it before Christmas and recommended shipping express; even though I still had two weeks until Christmas.  I did not go for the express and extra charges and the board arrived days before Christmas.",4.0
lots of fun,4.0
I had one when I was a kid.  You can't beat this action packed activity!  It brings hours of balancing fun.  My children love it too!  I purchased it for my ten year old.  The whole family uses it..when I'm not on it.,4.0
"A holiday gift for 3 kids who love to ski but live in a compact NYC apartment.  Between the 3 of them there's always someone practicing.  I remembered having one when we grew up and I loved it (though my brother was the one that could do headstands on it). It's nice to wood-- not plastic around the house, too.",4.0
A hit here. Not sure about one taken to PA. Cue sticks disappointing but OK for kids. 0,4.0
Just received this game board on Monday. My 11 year old son can't stop playing the Billiards game!! I'm thrilled to have found something for him to play other than video games!! My middle sister received this board game for Christmas in the late 70's and we played for hours on end until a fight usual broke out because we were so competitive...LOL. I'm happy to be making childhood memories with my son.,4.0
the Grandchildren loved the game board.,4.0
"Good job of recreating one of my favorite games. Damn you for not gluing one of the end caps and having it come out of the box in 2 pieces.
Lucky I had some Gorilla glue to repair it. Come on Carrom Mfg., Lets get back to quality control here.",4.0
It was what I needed. The board was broken but I am pretty sure that was from shipping,4.0
a game from years past..  I remember playing this when a child in the 1940's and 1950's  got for my grandchildren to play quality is good for this era games such as this may be a good alternative for all the electronics of today.  I am happy with my purchase as it brings back fond memories of the past with my childhood friend Dennis,4.0
"I like the board's size, build and finish, but I am used to wooden checkers/coins and a heavy striker to play with, so find the package of plastic checkers/coins and striker unimpressive. Overall a rating of 4 (would have been 5 if accompanied by wooden coins)",4.0
"Very surprised that cues for this game are now just pieces of dowling with a plastic cap, instead of the 'shaped' cues which came with the game in the past.  Game arrived promptly, in excellent condition.",4.0
"It's a good board, but it would be helpful to have the right side table or a stand for it.",4.0
This classic game was a hit with my kids now with my grandkids.  Wish it came with a box or bag for game pieces. Fun games and easy to makeup new games with pieces. Lightweight for easy storage.,4.0
Good for teens.,4.0
"Cost effective set. Great for carrom, checkers. The board as it is could have been a 5 star, if only they had packaged with some foam on the sides and glued the edges.  Opened the box and found one side is broken, it was actually for good. Else I would have been dissapointed with the lack of bounce. I took some carpenter glue and ran it through the rail, then the board came up alive. It bounces well and we are having a great time now with the board. Hard to complain as the price was so cheap, with a small glue and 5 minutes of drying time I am very happy customer.",4.0
I bought this game for my husband. He never played carrom growing up.  I played it a lot with my siblings in the winter time when we were growing up.  This game is so much fun for the whole family.  I did not give it a five star rating because it is not constructed as well as the older version was.,4.0
"For the money, this is nice board. The surface friction is a touch high, but you can remedy this with either Pledge or carrom powder (but not both! you don't want wet powder, heh.)

The plastic rings are reasonably heavy and rebound off of each other quite well. The pockets are larger than those on an Asian carrom board, which for me is a good thing. If you place this board on top of a table, there is a minor issue in that the mesh under the pockets will not hang all the way down, as it will instead make contact with the table surface. This can cause the  rings to rebound off of the other rings that are already inside of the pocket; my suggestion here is to simply remove each ring after it is scored.

Construction seems okay, but not great. The surface appears to be some sort of fiberboard with a faux wood grain finish. I have to say that the board feels a little delicate.

This is a good product. There are better carrom boards and crokinole boards, but they'll cost you much more.",4.0
Bought this for school age kids at childcare facility. Everyone seems to enjoy it.,4.0
"The first board I purchased was damaged in shipping but the replacement process was quite simple. There were no questions asked and we received the replacement in a few short days. The board is quite large and made of decent quality wood. I would not suggest dropping the board; however, with good care it should last for a long time.",4.0
"This is a great game I played as a kid. It has the same parts as mine had. The ""cues"" are just small dowel rods. We never used them anyway. The other games like checkers are only ok, but the carrom board is nice and smooth.",4.0
"I looked all over to find out what games can be played.  Obviously any using the chess/checker board.  The ones that are not listed are all variations of Carrom.  Different ways of playing.  That's all.  No big mystery.  Using the cues or not using the cues, number of players, positioning of pieces.  The game board itself is impressive.  The pieces are plastic and rather flimsy.  The game board is attractive and I'll be storing it where I can see it.  Plastic tips fit on the end of the raw wooden dowels.  I'll be sanding them down and conditioning the wood on those.",4.0
Really fun game board  and great quality as well. It's not too big or too small. We play few times a week.,4.0
Oh my gosh I love it as so do my little ones. The quality good be a little better especially with the wires used to hold in the net pockets. Yet it is holding together.,4.0
Great for a rainy day.  Family fun.  Came apart first day. A little glue and is perfect now.  You can make up your own games.  Fun.,4.0
Reminds me of the same Carrom game I played as a kid... ! Great old school family fun! Buy Now!,4.0
The only problem with it is that the pockets on the corners have too big of a weave and the rings fall out of them.,4.0
"I'm new to this board, having learned Crokinole a few weeks ago.  My son loved the game so I bought this board for him. The construction seems quality, the pieces are sturdy.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone looking for a board.  The two shortcomings, in my opinion, are minor but enough to warrant comment.

First, the many pieces (most of which I don't yet know how to use) come in a plastic bag that once you open it, it doesn't close again.  The board does not include a box for either the board or the pieces.  I realize the board itself is big and a box might not be necessary, but until I put all the pieces in a big zip-lock bag, I was constantly losing rings and pegs.  And even still, the two sticks don't fit into my bag.

Second, the included direction book has an extraordinary number of games and variations, which is awesome, but some of them are so vague and short or incomplete, they aren't as helpful or clear as you would like when you are learning new games. I had some questions about the rules when playing Crokinole and the short little directions included did not answer my questions.

Overall, I'm happy with the product.",4.0
The Carrom game is good family fun.  Sure beats sitting in front of a Screen all day and gets you together with friends and/or family,4.0
Wish had stated type equipment like plastic. Then wouldn't have purchased additional plastic equipment. For was concerned was wood. I had to reinsert some of the pocket nets. Otherwise all good,4.0
pretty nice carrom board--not a substantial as the one i had as a child (1950's). but still very good.  i would prefer wooden carrom pieces and i'm looking for some.,4.0
"Pros:
  - Well built
  - Ton of replay value

Cons:
  - A really large board making hard to fit this game in a smaller living space

"We had a Carrom board back in the day and would have finger splitting tournaments lasting for hours. Sturdy double sided board with different pieces for playing different games - all of which are explained with a rules booklet/pamphlet. Came packaged sturdily. The only thing I wish it came with was a stand - it's hard to figure out a surface that is sturdy enough yet allows the nets to hang down so that your pieces are flying out of them.

Great family game!",4.0
The game is fine but one corner piece was broken off when it arrived. Perhaps some styrofoam reinforcement pieces would help this.,4.0
Like all things it isn't as nice and solid as the old original games that I grew up with but its a fun game and we have enjoyed having one in our lives again.,4.0
"This was a wonderful surprise birthday present for my Mom, who used to play this with her family & I had childhood memories of playing with her!  We had a wonderful time playing, except for one thing:  I had not removed the board from the box prior to the party.  We opened one end of the box and pulled the carom board out, as we pulled the side came apart, and a piece of the frame snapped off.  I would recommend opening the entire box and lifting the carom board out!  Don't pull it out!  We used tape to play a few games at the party and Dad promised to glue and repair for her at home.
  A great alternative to a pool table & lots of fun too!",4.0
"We bought this game a while back and it has been a favorite in our house ever since. It is played by ages 7 - 80 and is very addictive. Once you start, you can't quit. The board was damaged a bit when we got it but Crazy Glue came to the rescue. The mesh pockets were no good. We got some smaller mesh and made new pockets so that the game pieces could not fall through the pockets. Now it's worth twice the money. All in All, great buy.",4.0
"Board needed to be glued together. Came apart getting it out of the packaging. Other than that, it was fine.",4.0
We got this for family nights as a Christmas present for our 5 year old to open. Over all I would say this is pretty good.  Some of the games are easy enough for him to grasp and play.  I only have two bad points.  (1) not enough red or green disks to play backgammon. (2) the handles for the tops break easy.,4.0
bought as a gift....haven't seen it used yet...hope it is as good as the old ones made of real wood....  basically it looks the same but with many more game options.....,4.0
"Our kids are 6 and 8 so I bought a Carrom board to introduce them to one of my favorite games from when I was a kid so they could have some summer fun. It is a big hit. There are 2 sides and a booklet detailing many variations and other games that can be played with the board if the kids get tired of plain old Carroms (not likely... they started working on their trick shots).
The ONLY COMPLAINT I have is that there is neither glue nor screws to keep the plastic corners on the wood sides. The very first time we pulled the board out of the box, it came apart, leaving me holding a wood side & 2 plastic corners. Our 6-year-old couldn't move it or set it up without the corners popping off and the board falling out. I finally drilled holes & secured all four plastic corners with screws and now we have a very sturdy board that should last for years. Had it come from the factory with secure corners, I would have given 5 stars.",4.0
The board is beautiful.  The sticks are pretty low quality....really just dowels with a rubber cap.,4.0
Carrom board has many possible board games some of which entail action.  This product has been around for at least 40 years and continues to provide entertainment for the whole family.,4.0
"Carrom board seemed to be made well.  I like the wooden carroms we had when we were kids, but the plastic may work well.  The cue sticks were only dowels and seemed cheap, but the rest of the game was good quality.
As I gave the game away as a gift I didn't get to play it myself, so only basing my opinions on visual inspection.",4.0
I loved playing this as a child and now I enjoy teaching my daughter how to play. It is similar to pool or billiards only with rings instead of balls. This game is a lot of fun for 7-10 year olds and some nostalgic adults. This set is very versatile and has many different games you could learn. I have only played carrom. The quality is about what you expect for the price. The game is great fun!,4.0
"This is exactly what I expected from a starter Carrom/Crokinole board. With the bonus of having a variety of different games to play when/if you tire of the aforementioned 2.

 The board is of fairly heavy ply with veneer or some sort of laminate to give the surface a nice flat, warp free surface(on both sides).  I did however, (lightly)rub in some standard furniture polish to reduce the friction of the Carrom men(pieces). And this worked fantastically. The board is surrounded by a raised impact plastic covering. That both serves as a rebound edge and to protect the board when stored or in tranasit. The nettings for the pockets is descent and should withstand years of regular use.

 The Carrom men(pieces) are of high quality plastic. And have a good heft to them considering what they are. They rebound and deflect off the other pieces pretty convincingly.
 Also included are: Cue sticks(wooden dowels with a plastic tip), pins(for some of the games - ie. Bowling stile or skittles), lightweight plastic tops used for games like Skittles. Paper inserts(#1-15) that are cut and placed within the hollow centers of the Carrom pieces for a few of the Carrom game variations provided in the game manual.  The manual itself is a compact, single fold/stapled affair.  The rules are clear for most games. And a little short of description, so you may find, if unfamiliar with a few of the games, that a couple of read throughs may be necessary.

 If this is your first set, or are thinking of buying a set for the ""Rest"" of the family or ""kids"" then this is a great, low-cost way to do it.",4.0
My son and I are very happy with this carrom board.  The quality is decent and the price was right.,4.0
"Got this as a Christmas gift and they loved this product.  The only diadvantage I have with this product is, the board is too small.  The advantage is there are so many games on just one product...and it works great.  The receiver loved it.",4.0
"Well, i have to give this game some props for good idea. But the American board holes is so huge! I play Carrom before and on this sort of small board big holed game board makes the game too slow! I could play Carrom in 3 hours, but on this board, 3 minutes! It becomes too easy on this small board.

This game isn't that hard to play either. My first try, wasn't that great though. But still, you take the striker and try to hit the pieces with lots of different obstacles, such as your piece might be stuck on your line so you have to hit it un-directly. It is a pretty fun game, and worth your money.",4.0
Works well for soccer season training and also good for water polo training. BTW- If you sell this for water polo now I get royalties for figuring out that it has a multi-purpose. ; ),4.0
I purchased this product as a Christmas present for a 10 year old girl.  She absolutely loves it. It has already helped improve her striking skills.,4.0
"I'm really not sure what to make of this as the reviews for it have obviously (if you are reading the other reviews here as well as this one) been all over the place.  Several complain about a lack of durability and/or lack of quality in the construction.  That said, it seems that most of the non-favorable reviews were years ago and that means it is entirely possible the manufacturer has changed things over time and has made improvements based on the feedback and complaints in those early reviews.
To be fair, I'm trying to base my review on the item that I received and not on knowledge of prior problems, but it is not easy to forget about the prior issues as I was and am concerned that something that I got with my soccer playing grandson in mind may not hold up and work long enough for him to actually even enjoy.
From what I've seen with this rebounder, I think my concerns are really nothing to be thinking of.  This set assembled easily enough and seems that it will hold up well enough and work well enough for my grandson to enjoy using to practice his skills on the soccer field (or, in the case of this item, on our lawn, or his parents lawn if he takes it home for a while to use there).
4 stars for an item that helps to keep our soccer playing family member busy enjoy outdoor exercise.",4.0

Pulls out of the ground easily when the ball is kicked forcefully enough. Other than that it's a great buy.,4.0
"My 12-yr old was able to assemble it with very little help (so, simple enough), and it has a strong structure and great rebound capability. Only negative is the net broke in the corner 2nd day when he kicked the ball into it. A knot came undone, and a string broke. Maybe I can fix it.",4.0

"easy to put together, good rebounder.",4.0
"Easy to assemble. One note, before you attach the two sides, make sure the spring loaded locks are facing the right direction. I did it wrong on both sides and had to disassemble and start over. The U shaped spikes meant to hold the frame into the ground are basically useless. After a few solid hits, you have to re-seat them  in another spot.",4.0
"I bought this so my grandson could practice soccer during his frequent visits.  Since the net must be tight, it is not real easy to assemble the first time; it gets easier with experience.
It needs to be secured to the ground or it will tip over with high hits.  He loves it!",4.0
Just as I expected. Good quality and durable.,4.0
"This has held  up well for a year of use.  Still a good rebounder.  And quite sturdy as well.  My kids used it to crawl in a window to get in a locked house one day very recently...after we've had this for a year now in the backyard - never been brought in....and my kids are no longer small (100 lbs and 150 lbs) and they were both on it.  I didn't realize they used it till later and was surprised the thing is just as good as new.  I'm not advocating it for this use (Yes, they were scolded for using it in this manner) but just to show that it is a good, sturdy product.",4.0
She loves it.  First year of soccer and she's having fun with it.,4.0
So far so good. I don't see this lasting for more than a year. My two boys age 6-9 love it. Light enough to move around by themselves. Adjustable angle works good. Assembly was straight foreward.,4.0
"Picked this up ""used"" on the Prime outlet and for $24 delivered, I can't complain.  Gonna help immensely to start the girls season (indoors) and get them up and running as well as being an option for our gks, being able to lob over this for free kicks.  Well worth it.",4.0
Likes this but wishes it was just a tad bit bigger. plays with it often though!,4.0

The setup is quick and easy but you should really read the directions in order to get it setup right.  Great net for kids to train on.,4.0
"My kids love this rebounder. We just purchased our second to replace our original, which lasted four years. My kids are older now, 12 and 13, so I wish they offered a larger size. Even with the stakes in place, the frame rocks back. But it serves its purpose and is in near constant use in our yard.",4.0
It works for my 7 years old.,4.0
This item iscreasonably priced. My son enjoys it. It's perfect for him. He's 7 so it's the right size. It's a pain to assemble. The instructions are terrible. Once it's assembled it's great.,4.0
"I bought this for my 10 year old that can't separate from a soccer ball. This net is great for him to practice straight on power shots. He enjoys the bounce back and doesn't have to dig a ball out of a traditional goalie net. The tilting options are so easy he makes adjustments in a snap. Tilt up and or down to practice fielding and receiving the ball. He assembled the majority of the frame/net by himself in less than an hour. I had to help:

1. Putting the final net ties on. As the net gets tighter you need an adult to help cinch up the ties. But that's what you want, is a tight, bouncy net.
2. I had to drill a hole in the frame to compensate for a missing hole from the manufacturer. No big deal, but it prevented my son from getting the last assembly nut/bolt into the frame. A slight oversight from the manufacturer, but it was a 1 min fix. Not worth the repackaging and sending back hassle...

It's also light enough for him to move around the yard. I'm thrilled and so is he.",4.0
"I have 2 girls (9&10 yrs old) who use this to work on their kicking velocity. They also use it for a goal.

This is a great rebounder and keeps my son and his friends busy for hours. We've had it a year now and the ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the bottom bar. I will probably have to buy a replacement soon. It has slowly been bending over the last year from the pressure of the net and now the net is not as springy as it used to be. If it was a stronger bar this net would be A+!,4.0
No instructions for putting together.  Otherwise it met our requirements for single player practice in the back yard. description was good,4.0
Works great for my 6 year old and his father - will really take a shot.  Pretty easy to put together too.  Only complaint is that the adjustable bars come out of their locks when I pick it up to move it sometimes.  Doesn't affect function though.,4.0
This is the second one we have purchased.  The first one lasted 3 years and would have lasted longer except we left it outside too much.  My only complaint is that it is a lot of work to put together to get started.  But once it is together it is great.,4.0
"My son uses it & loves playing soccer.with the net being a rebound one,he can play all by himself without any company.we keep it out in the backyard in summer & in the garage in winter.it looks like its going to hold up well for few more years.recommend it!",4.0
"I like the soccer rebounder, but am disappointed that the grandsons do not use it as much as I thought.  Perhaps they will in the future.",4.0

"My granddaughter loves it. Their backyard is small, so it fit the space and she was able to practice her scoring technique.",4.0
"It's a good product for the money. The rope seems to tear a little after some uses. The rope is thinner than I thought it would be, however considering it  is for my 9 year old son and it is reasonably priced, I would recommend the product. Great ball return",4.0
This works well.  My daughter loves to shoot goals to this net.  I like the size because it gives her a small target and the balls return.  Keep in mind the ball does not return directly to the player.  The ball wildly return to different locations based on the speed and angle of the strike but it is much better than walking up to the net to collect balls.  It also serves to provide practice stopping and controlling a passed ball in open field.  I would have rated it 5 stars if the stakes provided worked well.  The stakes are necassary to hold the net frame firm in the ground and only work for about 10 shots before having to reset the stakes.  I used my tent stakes and rope to secure the net frame to the ground permanently.,4.0
"Got this for my older nephew to help with goalie training,  now used by his younger siblings also to improve their skills.",4.0
"Easy assembly, thought stretching the net required two people. Works great, a good value for the price. The packaging was well done and it is easy to disassemble.",4.0
"Easy to set up, sturdy, even with a 16 year old kicking balls against it. I should have measured things out a bit better before, because it is a little smaller than I thought it was going to be. Happy with it!",4.0
"A better anchoring system would help;  fairly easy to assemble, but takes a bit of strength to attach all the elastic bands.  All-in-all, I would recommend this for youth soccer players...its been loads of fun, but be careful of those rebounds when you are up close!!",4.0
We bought this for our 6 year old and it's perfect for him to kick a soccer ball against and have it bounce right back to him.  It's light weight enough that he can move it around the yard himself.  Good buy for a kid.,4.0
"not long after I told my wife how I felt the goal was well made and not plastic, the only plastic piece on the goal broke. the plastic latch on one of the goal arms cracked.

edit to add: they did indeed send me two new latches within a few days",4.0
This is a rebounder soccer net which means that the ball kicks back quickly to the person kicking the ball.  I didn't quite read the description well or was not knowledgable about soccer nets.  My son was hoping for a more loose net that would catch the ball rather than return it.  This net is awesome if you're looking for a play alone soccer net that will return the ball quickly to the player.,4.0
Easy set up and works well. Kids get sick of it after a while. But always go back to it when practicing alone.,4.0
"I bought two of these to replace some worn out smaller goals for my kids. The big benefit of these rebounders are that they are large enough for my kids (8, 6 & 6) to really practice shooting at, while they are small enough that you can still play without a goalie. Additionally, the ball comes right back out which keeps the game moving and lets them practice better on their own. At the price, it's hard to imagine doing much better.",4.0
"I bought this for my 9 year old son for his birthday.  It was easy to put together (though it's best done with 2 people).  He loves using it and it really does ""kick"" the ball back at you at a good speed.  My only complaint is that one edge of the net appears to be slightly damaged and I don't know how long it will hold.  It wasn't bad enough that I felt like I needed to return the product though.",4.0
"We bought this for our son, wish it was the bigger one. But this one is great for him to practice on and improve his goal kicking accuracy.",4.0

We gave this rebounder to our 11-year old son for his birthday. So far so good.  The only issue is that the stakes provided are not strong enough to hold the unit in place.  No big deal - we put a couple of cinder blocks in their place and they keep the rebounder from moving.  Perhaps larger/longer stakes would also solve this problem.,4.0
"The kids love it! One issue - the net came with a few broken links. Big bummer! I contacted the company upon discovery (a couple of days after Christmas). I haven't heard back from them yet, which also disappoints me. I know Amazon would have exchanged it for me, but I recycled the box the morning before putting it together. Whoops!

Learn from me! Order this if you're looking at it, but inspect it when you get it.",4.0
My son it 9 and loves this kick back goal.  It really helps him to warm up and work on his aim and goal shots.  Very sturdy and stays upright unlike other goals we've tried.,4.0
You need to stake the unit to the ground really well. My 7 year old nephew loved it and wasn't able to turn it over even though he kicks really hard.,4.0
"The overall construction was good but the netting had an issue.  There was an area of about two inches that had frayed down to a single thread.  Net will not last very long.  I have written Amazon about getting a replacement net.  Love dealing with Amazon.  This is my first issue with a product I got on Amazon.  Keep up the good service, etc.  Linda",4.0
The rebounder was a great investment. It has worked great for my U8 girls. It is sturdy enough for their kicks. My goalies also get a great workout. It allows them to practice their kicks and allows me to use it as part of my circuit training. My 10 year has also used it for his training. Great price for a great tool.,4.0
"I bought this as a birthday present for my 9 year old. He loves it. The rebound is strong, so he could practice trapping the ball back or head it back to the net. Seems to be durable and net is strong too.

Only con is the stakes to anchor the post to the ground comes off every now and then with some decent hits to the net. We place a mallot there inside the net, so to tap in the stakes whenever it pops up. but is becoming annoying the post coming off with few shots at the net.

But if I can fix that, i think this works pretty well.",4.0
I am quite satisfied with my rebounder. My son enjoys it very much. He plays with it the moment he gets home from school until he is thoroughly tired. My other kids enjoys it as well. Can't be more pleased.,4.0
"My daughter likes her new soccer goal.  She is only 9 and does not kick the ball super hard so I am not really sure how it will hold up and work for older kids.  The goal part of the assembly was fairly easy.  We could never get the net installed exactly like the poor instructions illustrated, but it seems to work fine.",4.0
"I purchased this for my son hoping that it would help him on his soccer skills. He was excited when it first arrived, playing on it continuously.

It's a lot larger than I thought. The assembly was a little process, but nothing one person can't handle. Mainly the net and the hooks have to be precise, but other than that, no problem.

I would have purchased an adjustable height rebounder if I had known my son's kicks were going to be so high. He's 8 and has a really great foot. If you kick to high, this rebounder serves little purpose.

Overall, it's a great addition to have for your soccer player.",4.0
"Okay helmet, I think the band is more comfortable then the 3m helmets. But it does not have quick adjust, but it is simple to put together and adjust when needed. My head size is about 7 1/2 and it fits well. The craftmanship isn't great, it is just NY stickers on a blue hardhat.",4.0
"Got this for my niece's husband, Bengals fan, don't ask me why.  Hahaha  he was pretty stoked on it.  I wish the stickering of the Bengal print had been placed on there a little better.  Other than that He was super proud to wear it to work around his construction buddies.",4.0
"This was the second one I ordered.  The first one was from a different company and it looked like someone put the webbing together all wrong. I sent that one back and ordered this one.

"the griddle works great, I have used it a ton. My only cautions are that it is super heavy and b/c it is cast iron, you need to clean and dry it thoroughly or it will rust. Overall, for the price it is well worth it.",4.0
I bought this product after reading other previews.  I was very pleased. It is very heavy so you don't want to put away.  I use it almost every day for breakfast or supper foods.  Very good item for the price. I was completely satisfied.,4.0
"I bought one of these a few months ago but didn't realize it was not pre-seasoned. I have baked it twice for hours to season it and tried top brand name oils but still cannot get it seasoned. I just get this peeling layer of oil that won't penetrate into the cast iron. Nevertheless, it still cooks great. Very heavy but cooks nice like cast iron should. I would highly recommend paying a little extra though and getting one pre-seasoned.",4.0
"always need a griddle, even if I use it less than I thought I would and the price was right ($20!).",4.0
"I seasoned this christmas present and used it the day after to make pancakes. Wonderful! No sticking, easy on and off ... I can't wait to turn myself into a Backyard Bob on the inside.",4.0
"I am very glad that I purchased this item.  I really enjoy using it even if it is heavy to lift, but it does a fantastic job and food taste just like you did it on an outdoor grill.",4.0
"I ordered my griddle and was expecting to wait 2 months before I actually got it ... but I received it in about 2 weeks.  I love the griddle.  I've grilled veggies, sausages and bread.  On the smooth side I made pancakes and it worked great.  I'll probably order another piece of cast iron cookwear pretty soon.  I have my eye on the paninni press.

The only thing that I'd change would be to somehow anchor the griddle to my stove to keep it from sliding on my burners.

Anyway...I recommend this product.

"This grill is the newest in my cast iron collection, which I have come to use reutienely. While it is good grill, one problem I see is that it has 2 hotspots under the burners, and the area in between is defenitely cooler. One of the primary reasons for me to buy this griddlw was to make different shaped pancakes(animals, train, even a minivan)  for my kids, and I am having some trouble with the hotspots. After a few uses, it has seasoned quite well.

I have not used the other side yet.",4.0
"If you like to grill in the winter, then you should buy this grill!  Season it well and follow all the instructions and you'll have no trouble keeping the grill clean.  The griddle is great for Sunday morning breakfasts.  It is heavy, so you've been warned.  Non-stick grills can't compared, as the non-stick peels away after awhile.  This grill will last!",4.0
"Once seasoned this is a great,if messy item to use. Lodge is about as good as cast irons get; their products have a nasty habit of out living those that purchase them. There would be many more used pans around but many were melted down during WW II. Try to set up a surround to catch the splatter. Check out the grill area in your local diner. Many times these type of grills are shown in adds cooking bacon and eggs. Yeah,right. Eggs O.K., Bacon? Nah! If you can't get your irons from a restaurant going out of business or a farm sale(Check institutions also. I picked up a great set of three pans for $20.00 from a moving company selling off abandoned belongings.)Season well before first use. A rule of thumb is to use it for french fries for the first 5-6 times. NEVER try to cook starch or sugar foods (Pan cakes, Tomato sauce etc. etc.)the first Ten times of use!!!!(Tomato products never.) Pro cooks never use the first crepe even though their pans are well seasoned. For the best seasoning build a fire outside and put the iron in it. This will burn off the wax coating or SOAP residue and tighten up the metal. If that seems a little over the top for you, put it in the bottom of your oven for about a month. Some smoke will always be present when seasoning an iron which is why I suggest doing it outside or letting your favorite restaurant do it for you. Just drop it off and they will burn and abuse it into terrific shape. In about three months your iron will be like teflon;ugly as sin,but a great pan. When cleaning: NEVER NEVER use soap!!!(The chinese never use soap in their woks and they are made from plain sheet steel). While I do use dish soap on the outsides I never use soap on the cooking surface of any of my fry pans be they stainless,aluminum or iron. Just wipe it out with a paper towel or damp cloth and immediately add a light coating of oil. If necessary, use plain hot water and a little E grease. On occasion when there is something burned onto the surface,I put a small amount of water into the pan and bring to a boil then gently scrape the surface with a straight edged spatula or a piece of fine plain steel wool (Not Brillo). Empty the water and IMMEDIATELY coat with corn or veg oil. And NEVER EVER let an iron soak..If you do, you will probably want to throw your rusty and pitted iron away. The next time you use it rub a few drops of oil over the surface,place on the heat then add your cooking oil. Also,whenever possible, after cooking outdoors,use the fine talcum like dust left in the BarBQ. Scour with the ash, rinse well and coat with a neutral oil and put on a heat source if possible. Allow to cool and wipe off residue. Again,these iron grills are great for vented cooking but they will produce smoke. Use one on the barbie for adding grill marks to fish and steaks. They can be a real mess indoors especially if you do not have a vent hood. And don't forget the wrap around splatter screen. Finally,if your not real dedicated to this type of cookware FORGETABOUTIT. It can be a pain. stick with your usual teflon cookware. That's why they invented the stuff.",4.0
"For pancakes, this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly, and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but...you...must...season this and instruct well-meaning helpers NOT, repeat, NOT to use any soap of any kind, sponge, steel wool pad, on the griddle. Ever. If you are worried about cleaning it, you can scrub the surface with a hot, clean water, handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel. After seasoning, pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast. Just remember about the seasoning and the No-Soap.",4.0
"There's really not much I can say about this.  It's a very good griddle that fits my stove top and oven perfectly (remember to measure yours before buying -- this thing is long).  I seasoned it in the oven as directed and everything cooks on it fine.  It's especially nice to sear some steaks on it and then pick up the whole thing with oven mitts and put it into the oven for full cooking.  The one downside is the cleanup:  it's very big and heavy, so getting it into the sink and cleaned is somewhat of a chore.  But, overall, I'm very happy with it.",4.0
"Great to cook lots. There is lots of space to cook perfectly several steaks at a time.
I use it for meat, it's make's it very similar cooking than with a BBQ.
Indestructible!
CAREFULL:
* This needs to be hand washed, it MUST not go in the dishwasher
It's not that easy to clean specially on the striped part.
* You need to prepare the grill before you can use it the first time or it will get very rusty. Preparation: putting a layer of oil and baking it in your oven for an hour. (Oil smell in the house and oil all over the kitchen)
More explanations on the lodgemfg.com web site
* It takes a little while to cool down.
That means keeping it on the stove until its cooler, it's heavy and there are no handles.
I do recommend it; I enjoy it very much it's worth the hassle.
But don't want people to be surprised!",4.0
"I really have enjoyed this product.  I like to enjoy it with some tea and a warm afternoon.  Heck the only two recommendations I would make would be:  1.) Make sure you don't let your dogs too close or they may eat it (or sleep in it), and 2.) Have a nice evening dinner to enjoy after your relaxing day on the hammock.",4.0
"I love having a hammock again.  It has been at least 10 years since I've been on one.  The boys and I gave this to my husband for father's day and he just loves it.  It took a while to hang it because when I purchased it they did not give me any info on how to or what to use to hang it off of trees.  You should really sell the tree strap kit along with it or include with the hammock.  The hammock stands just don't cut it as far as comfort and blending with nature.  Anyway, we love it, so please enjoy!!!",4.0
"This is a very sturdy, quality product.  My daughter plays w/it everyday!  The only problem we've had is there is a slow leak in the ball and she has to air it up prior to playing, but a small hand pump came w/it and is easy for her to use.  We will see about replacing the ball, other than that we're very pleased w/this item.",4.0
"This is a good tetherball system; the pole can be removed (ours is at the bottom of our sledding hill, so we will take it out of the hole in the winter).  BUT...the ball is not of very good quality.  We have had it in the yard for only four weeks and the ball is bleached by the sun on the top and the rope already broke.  But you can buy another ball.  The best part is the pole is solid, and as I said, removable.  I would recommend this set.",4.0

"Worked fine - we had to have them ship us another order, as the first one showed up without the actual tetherball -- so that was a downer. Keep in mind, however, that this puppy takes some time to install. Yes, it needs to be concreted in. We drove it into the yard to test it. it all worked fine, but the pole wallered out a hole really fast. So, to do it right, it needs to be concreted into place. That's a 1/2 day job -- or it was for me -- to do it right. Just a good head's up. We like it tho. Gets decent use at our house.",4.0

"I was looking for a different type of fun outdoor activity for the kids. If you like this activity, then I recommend this brand. It was easy to assemble and the pump for the ball was included. You do need two people to dig the hole and insert it in. It'll make it much easier because the pole is really tall.",4.0
Only problem I have had was the ball was too soft for what I wanted. My dog plays tether ball and he has chewed the ball to pieces. I need a harder ball for him.,4.0
We're pleased with the Park and Sun set we got for our grandson. He's super excited about tetherball at school and is thrilled to have his own set now. The rope was long enough to lower down to his height. We mounted it in a tire and everyone is happy with the set up. It's a perfect set for a newcomer to the sport--not too expensive but a well built to withstand a 7 year old and his friends.,4.0
I am mostly pleased with this product for the cost. The only thing I am disappointed about was that there were no instructions for assembly or even suggestions for securing into the ground. I found suggestions easily on google. The only other minor suggestion would be to have 2 buttons on each tube for securing them to each other instead of only one on one side making the fully assembled pole a bit shaky. There could also be height adjustments for times playing with different ages. Overall a real good product.,4.0
"The kids enjoyed it,  but the ball wouldn't stay inflated for a long time.  Should have been better quality perhaps?",4.0
My husband and I purchased this tetherball set from Amazon for our 7 year old granddaughter's birthday. She loves playing tetherball  and it looks like we may have to purchase another since the family dog loved it too!,4.0
"I bought to mount in the back yard, but wife decided it should be movable, so it was mounted in cement in an old tire we had. This set is great and the kids have not stopped playing with it, even in the heat they are out there enjoying it. Only criticism I have is that the pole itself seems a little weak, should be a thicker gauge pole for this type of it. The kids haven't been mishandling it by any means, but it is occasionally bent slightly. I have had to force it straight again several times. AS long as the metal holds out and doesn't break we should be able to enjoy it for a while.",4.0
"We bought this set after our kids had a fun experience with tetherball on a recent camping trip.  It comes with a 12"" sleeve that gets cemented in the ground and the pole then slides in/out for use or storage.  We dug a hole 12"" deep by 9"" wide in the back yard.  After taping off the bottom of the sleeve we placed the bottom half of the two-piece pole into the sleeve and centered it in the hole.  We used string, tent stakes and a level to make sure the pole was plumb, then mixed the concrete and poured.  After setting for a couple of days it was ready to go.  We just pumped up the ball, tied it to the eyelet at the top of the upper pole and connected the two poles.  We did find that the ball was hanging low so we adjusted the tie-off.

The kids love playing and it is a lot of fun.  One minor drawback is that the two-piece pole does 'wobble' a bit between the two sections and within the sleeve.  But it's not that noticeable and does not detract from the fun.  The ball is pretty hard when inflated to the recommended pressure, would hurt if hit in the head, etc.",4.0
"A lot of entertainment for the money!  We found this very easy to install.  The hardest part is waiting for the concrete to harden up!! The kids were so excited - 11 years old. Great, inexpensive and brings back memories of playing when I was a kid.",4.0
"I read alot of reviews that had me concerned about ordering tetherball but was well pleased with this set.  The only reason I gave it a four star
was because the cord stretched too long after playing the game awhile.  That can be remedied though.  The pole was very solid and came with a sleeve that we set down in a base of concrete in an old tire.  It works great and it alot of fun.",4.0
Pretty standard system - cement in place.  Like the feature where you can just slip the pole out of the pvc pipe when not in use.,4.0

This is great for practice and having fun with a few friends in your back garden but is best for children 16 and under in my opinoin which it is meant for I would think...lol. It is easy to put together and with the four stakes that hold it in the ground (that come with it) make it stay in place. The only problem is kicking the ball extremely hard into the net as it rips off the straps that keep the net on the goal. With that said, I've had alot of fun with this and it is great if you like to get the football out and shoot around a little before or after the game on match day. ""Glory Glory Man United...""",4.0

It's a great net for my son to practice soccer. But unless you plan on pulling it inside everyday the velcro straps will come off. We have had it a year now and it is still in good shape but we have lost a lot of the velcro.,4.0

"It's probably an already duh comment. But it does not resist Florida weather. Please note that it took awhile.

 The Velcro came apart. The netting remained fine. The metal rusted. (It's easy to set up initially) but to keep tearing it apart and setting back up, wasn't for us. (Let alone storing it)

It does move with ease for when we cut the grass we can move it aside.

The reason for the 4 stars and not lower, for the price, and the time we had it before these things started to go awry, it was well worth the money spent and our son using it.",4.0
"For a cheap backyard goal this works perfectly.  Very easy to assemble, sturdy enough for casual play, and the price is right.  Highly recommend for someone looking to put something in their backyard but if you are looking to really abuse a goal through team soccer practices and what not you may want to step up to something more sturdy.  For me, this is exactly what I wanted and I am happy that I picked one up.",4.0
I debated between a 3 or 4 star review.  The goal frame itself has been solid and we have had no issues with it. The net has not ripped or torn.  The velcro that attaches the net to the post and crossbar is awful.  It simply falls apart.  We have had to replace most of it and have had the goal a little over 2 months. I would buy it again if necessary but will definitely get backup velcro or alternate ways to attach the net.,4.0
"It's a pretty nice net and fairly easy to put together; however, the ad has false advertisement because the ""silver"" one is actually not silver; it has a white frame. The white paint will invariably chip off (especially where the tubes slide together) and my concern is that it will rust easily, whereas the silver one would likely have been galvanized or aluminum or something that wouldn't rust. We'll see.",4.0

Easy to assemble and so far my kids have loved it!,4.0
Good value and easy to assemble. Not sure how well the net will hold up as it seems very thin but so far it is OK.,4.0
"It took some time for it to get delivered soo I didn't like that so much but The goal is pretty good , it's holding up to U14 soccer teams and I'm really liking it. It takes some time to assemble at first but after you get it done it's easier to form it.",4.0
Fairly easy to put together. Has taken some battering from my soccer mad son and is still in one piece. So far I am pleased.,4.0
"I should probably give the net five stars considering how many years it's been in the yard and how much abuse it has taken, but after a couple of years, I think loosing one star for having to put on two dozen zip ties to keep the net together is fair. It's started to sag a little in the middle, but I'm pretty sure that is due to my kids abusing it. To build something the kids couldn't break, you'd have to use tube steel and the thing would weigh 400 pounds and then you would have to anchor it in concrete so it wouldn't fall over and kill anyone. I'm thinking this was probably a better choice. Really it's done much better than I expected and it keeps the ball from sailing over into the neighbors yard and/or down the hill. I'm calling it a win.",4.0
"Good heavy framed goal...easy to assemble , Grandson well pleased. The only complaint is the velcro tape used to hold the net doesn't last very long so I used plastic zip ties to help hold it in place.",4.0
"Got this for my 8 year old soccer fanatic.  It was very quick and easy to assemble without assistance (maybe 5 minutes).  I'm disappointed the net is extremely loose and saggy.  The velcro straps you use to attach it mean you can take the goal apart if you need to (which is nice) but they don't hold the net very well.  I may switch to zip ties and just snip them off if I ever need to take the frame apart.  He's had it for like 3 days already and has only broken one velcro strap (I have no clue how).  The frame appears sturdy enough even for my wild child.  The entire goal is relatively large (for a kid) but it's not heavy if you need to move it.  Overall, seems like a very good purchase.",4.0
Easy to assembly.  The quality is fine with the price.  The design could be better.  I am thinking about getting a few sand bags to secure the goal against strong wind.  The pins for securing the net to the ground are very thin.,4.0
"Overall this is a nice soccer goal, and perfect for smaller yards.  The goal comes in pieces, with the metal poles requiring assembly into each other to make the goal itself.  This was fairly straightforward, and the goal seems strong and well built once I set it up.  My only complaint is that the net isn't really designed to go onto the goal.  It comes with little velcro straps that you have to use to attach the net to the goal.  I would have preferred if the net threaded onto the goal, or if the net itself had velcro or some other feature to allow a more seamless attachment to the poles.  This would have made a better overall design.  But for a simple goal that is relatively easy to setup, this is a nice option.",4.0
I am giving this 4 stars and the only reason for that is that the string that comes on to tight the net is not strong enough we had to buy cable tights other than that is perfect my kids have so much fun with it I can watch him play and his friends come over to play with him it was a perfect christmas gift. I found nets in local stores for maybe ten dollar less and they was smaller and plastic so the price that you are paying for this is worth the quality compared to other cheap material,4.0
"Great soccer goal made with a powder coated steel frame and very strong, sturdy net. Sets up and takes down easily, and takes a lot of kid powered abuse! Sized for littles, so if your kids are bigger, you'll want to go for a bigger net.",4.0
"This is a nice smaller and more portable soccer goal for practice or just having fun at the park. It is easy to set up and easy to fold for transport. The frame is fairly strong and is definitely strong enough to hold the net. Though it is easy to set up and take apart, it does take some time. It's not a quick up and down set up. The net is not as strong as I would like it to be and it seems a bit tighter on the frame than the picture shows and doesn't fit as well. If you have a really strong kicker the net may not last long. Other than that, it's a good practice net for the backyard.",4.0
"Steel frame clicks together.
If you know what a goal should look like, you'll have no trouble figuring out what goes where without instructions.
Then you fasten a few dozen Velcro straps to attach the net to the frame.
Disassembly is equally straightforward.
It's time-consuming, but couldn't be simpler.",4.0
"Though not designed to be a ""portable"" goal, this small goal breaks down and sets up pretty easily, and it isn't too bulky to transport to and from practice venues.  The instructions are limited, but the set up is relatively intuitive, and a person can set it up solo in less than half an hour.  The frame is sturdy and the net, though lightweight, has held up to everything our 8- and 6yos have kicked at it.  This goal is the ""right size"" for small kids to shoot at and defend in games, and is a convenient size to set up for practicing targeted shots at home for older kids.

Please note! Franklin makes several sizes, so be sure you're getting something appropriate for the age of the player(s).  Here's a guide for youth soccer goal sizes:

Not bad for the price. Your not getting a top of the line professional goal post for this price but this will do. Comes with stakes so it won't tip over. Velcro ties to hold net fall off quickly but you can use zip ties,4.0
"Good quality, easily assembled. Better than I thought it would be from some of the reviews. We just wanted something simple for our kids (4 & 9)  to use in the garden, nothing high tech and this is perfect.",4.0
"I play soccer just for fun, not competitive at all, but I do find it to be relaxing and great exercise. I've always wanted my own goal and I must say this is perfect for backyard use. I've been using it about every day and haven't moved it from the back yard, which is saying a lot living in Florida where the sun is absolutely pounding on it...as well as lots of rain.

Assembling the goal was easy enough as were the directions. I wasn't looking forward to putting it together but it was done before I knew it. I am disappointed with the Velcros and the amount that they supplied. I wish they were a little more heavy duty, as I am not the strongest kicker and they fall off sometimes. I will have to pick up a pack of heavy duty ones later.

I can use the net without having fears of it moving around which is great. This is such an awesome net to practice accuracy shots and to have little 1 on 1 games with friends.

I am going to keep the net longer outside and will update the review if anything changes regarding the net.",4.0
"Easy to put together and helpful to have the colored tabs indicating the top & bottom of the net.  Minus 1-star because I can already tell that the velcro strap that hold the net on are doing to ware very quickly, but it's an easy fix to buy new ones.  The goal is a good practice size for toddlers to younger kids (7-9).",4.0
Bought this for my 13 year old nephew. Great size and definitely worth the price. Would have given it 5 stars but additional zip ties needed to be added to the ropes just to give it a better fit. Other than that great!,4.0
"Bought this for my 12 year old son. Two of the velcro straps, that hold the net on the poles, have broken. I think we will replace them with zip-ties. Otherwise, it's a great purchase!",4.0
"This is a great home or school practice net. The metal poles are solid construction and the yellow net is easy to see. This net is 6'X4' which is great for home use because it does not take up the entire yard, but is large enough for practice and play. It contains stakes that keep the net from tipping over, but the poles are heavy enough that it will stay in place under most circumstances. The net is attached with Velcro strips which makes assemble easy, but durability in the weather could be questionable. It comes nicely packed in plastic and can be assembled by one person. Overall the construction, and quality is very good.  The only concern that I have is the long term effects of the weather on the Velcro strips.",4.0
"Would give 5 stars but net ripped first day when ball was kicked in hard by an adult however, very small hole and not terrible. Very easy to Put together. Construction is solid. Got for Kids, they love it.",4.0
"A little flimsier than expected, but we didn't know what to expect.  It's great for the price.  I would recommend it.",4.0
"Great product, however, this was mailed in the original packaging. It was sitting on the doorstep in full view for my son to see.  Maybe if I chose the ""gift"" option, it would have been disguised.",4.0
Quality soccer net that's easy to put together.  Seems sturdy and built to last.  Good value overall.,4.0
"So far, so good. Need to see how it lasts when used a lot.",4.0
Decent goal. It is better than the PVC types. The notes on the poor velcro straps are all true. Just use zip ties to remedy. Durability over time is yet to be determined but I would recommend.,4.0
"Great goal, easy setup, but for someone who kicks 70-85mph, the net ripped easily lol",4.0
"It took me like 5 minutes to assemble it , like someone suggested I used zip ties instead of provided Velcro straps. The quality is ok , not very sturdy but my daughter is only six and not a rough player so I hope it will last for couple of years.",4.0
"Very nice goal, although not very portable.  This is a perfect goal that would be used in a stationary place.  There are several parts and a bit time consuming to construct.  I do not recommend if intending on transporting to & from practices",4.0
Sturdy enough for youngsters. Easy setup. No complaints,4.0
Good product.,4.0
was pretty easy to put together. Took about 20 minutes with my kids helping. works fine. Not super study but does the job. We just have it on our driveway for them to kick balls into and they drag in on the street to play with neighbors.,4.0
Don't let the kids hang on the cross bar...it ended up bending a little(totally the kids fault).  My son and his friends love playing with this net.  easy to assemble and disassemble at the beginning or end of soccer season. Going on 2 years and still getting great use.,4.0
"They should add holes on the bottom of the pipes, so if water from sprinklers go in, it would drain and dry out. I put holes in myself to do just that.",4.0
Quality built.  Should easily last the season and hopefully a few more.,4.0
"Only complaint is when we went to assemble it, one of the arm ends was flattened a bit and would not connect. Looked like it happened before it was painted, but had a small rust spot started too. We fixed it ourselves, since we would have a super sad 8 year old otherwise waiting for a replacement...",4.0
It's a nice net for practice for my kids. The price was spot on. I only had a problem with some of the pieces they were bent pretty bad that I had to use pliers to fix to make all the male end of the pipes fit into the female connectors.,4.0
This was a Christmas gift for boys age 9 & 10 who play little league. Great starter set for them. Have to make a mesh bag for them to carry the bases in.,4.0
"We bought these for our son's 7th birthday.  These bases are very heavy rubber.  They've made it through several ""games"" with the neighbors and lots of play in the three days that we've had them.  I anticipate that they will last a long time and our son loves them.",4.0
"work great, but,l i wish i had gotten a little larger size",4.0
"The anchors aren't strong enough to keep it in the ground, but otherwise it's fine.",4.0
Nice post.. Light weight,4.0
I was nervous to buy this product as some of the reviews showed pictures of the product broken. Mine have been outside for the past 4 months and are doing fine. We don't experience snow so I'm not sure how it would do under those conditions.,4.0
"After less than a week of backyard use with an under 10 year old, many of the Velcro straps broke off.  Replaced them with zip ties.  Other than that, it seems fine for a simple goal for the price.  It's easy to put together and stays anchored in the ground.  Recommended for backyard use.",4.0
get it,4.0
Easy set up. Wish it came with a carrying bag,4.0
"We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our sons, ages 8 and 6.  It is perfect for them and they use it several days a week and I anticipate it will get a lot of use in the spring and summer.  It was easy to put together and because if reviews I read here, I suggested that my husband use zip ties to strengthen the hold.",4.0
"This is a decent kids backyard soccer goal. The steel bars are reasonably strong, though now my son, a regular soccer player, is 16 and can kick a ball really hard - the steel tubes can buckle in the end if they are not reinforced a bit. Probably best for younger kids. The worst thing about this goal are the Velcro ties to hold the net to the frame - these give way far too easily. Consider replacing them with wire ties or something stronger.",4.0
"The bars were bent when this came, luckily my husband was able to bang it enough to get the pieces to fit together.
Otherwise, we love it!",4.0
"I purchased two of these small pick up games with my friends and coworkers. The nets are a good size for small games, like 7-on-7, or just for shooting and target practice. The metal framing is really sturdy and the nets haven't given out yet. Set up relatively easy, but taking it apart and storing it is a pain. I know its supposed to fit back in the box, but it really doesn't. Invest in a good sized carrying bag if its not just gonna sit in your backyard.",4.0
"Its worth the cost .. I should have got the larger one, but this is of right size for backyard",4.0
useful,4.0
"Was expecting a little more...height, maybe? But they do the job. They lie pretty flat to the ground. More or less a sturdy but bendable rubber construction.",4.0
Great space saver,4.0
"I bought these for a league I run.  For the price, you can't really beat it as compared to higher quality (and more expensive) goals.  It was very easy to assemble, and it very easy to move on and off the field for one person.  That was why I wanted it.  It was for the most part sturdy enough to hold up for a season, (and I imagine next season, too) but you do need to use the anchors/stakes that come with it.  I give it 4 stars because the stakes are not very sturdy if your ground is hard.  Also, we had a few kids who were... well, kids... and would jump up and grab the crossbar.  Essentially, imagine them ""dunking"" on it.  It did not take much effort for them to bend the crossbar.  A few dads bent it back, and in one case I just ordered a replacement part from Franklin for $12.  That's my only real knock on the product.  Like I said, compared to other goals for a league, you can't really beat this for the price.  If you are looking to get this for simply your backyard, I don't think you are going to find much better.",4.0
two 10 year olds and two 12 year olds were able to put this together themselves.  so far so good!  Theyre enjoying it!!,4.0
"Good value for the price. Overall I'm very pleased and got what I was expecting. We've been using it on asphalt, dragging it around and It's pretty sturdy. I gave it only four stars because I bought two and one of the ends of one section/tube was bent/crushed. Not wanting to deal with boxing it back up and returning it I unbent it with pliers and forced it together. Seems to be fine, a bit scratched at that spot but I put some white duct tape over it to prevent rusting. Great fun for my 8 year old son and I to play a little street soccer!",4.0
"Great, stirdy net and poles however, the velcro net holders do come off. We ended up using zip ties.",4.0
The only reason I would not give it a 5 is because it did not come with a carrying case like some of the other sets. The bases are very very well made (heavy) and perfect for what we needed - just wish we had a case!,4.0
"Home plate is already ripped, but it's not a bad product. I'd buy it again.",4.0
Works well after a year of use still good.  The velcro fasteners need to be more heavy-duty if they are to last... but you can replace with ties of any sort.,4.0
"It last only for few years. Net and goal don't hold together, so I had to put some tape to keep it on. But overall its good",4.0
The velcro didn't last long so we had to fix it but not bad for a starter goal.  My son is on a travel team and is outside almost everyday practicing his shots.  10 months going strong besides the velcro.,4.0
"Great set of goals. I use them for a mens indoor soccer league and they have held up well. They do take around 5-10mins to set-up and the velcro straps for the nets quickly break, apart from that though I would highly recommend.",4.0
Kids love it it.,4.0
"easy to assemble!  seems to sag a bit in the middle, but not much.  otherwise, it seems very sturdy.",4.0
"They hold up really well.

I wish they had some kind of eyelet or something built in so I could tie them together or something.  I drilled holes in the corners and put a big carabiner through them which works well, but the hole is a bit rough.",4.0
"Great little goal for the price. My wife is a soccer fanatic and this goal is perfect for even backyard drills and mini games. The only thing I would say takes away that one star is the fact that any real shot will pull out the stakes. Its a quick fix to just go to walmart and pick up a few tent stakes and some twine for 2 bucks and put some extra support on it, other than that, its great!",4.0
Perfect size for a 3 year old and it will list him for a few years.  It does rust fairly easily though if left out.,4.0
"The goal is solid and easy to assamble. But don't leave it outside for more then a few days the assambly hardware will rust, or anywhere the paint has been scarped off on the goal will rust. Was a mess when I brought it inside to disassemble in preperation for bad weather.",4.0
"Had this goal for one year now and so glad I bought it for my boys (now 9 & 7).  Aside from making our backyard a very popular place for friends, the boys want to go out and practice and work on their skills.  I've had to replace almost all the Velcro straps in our northern climate, but no big deal.  Oh, and don't let your 7 year old hang from the cross bar, it will bend...",4.0
"overall satisfied with product, although I wish the metal bars were a little wider. But, I got item as advertised. Good Quality, and I have a very happy 3 year old.",4.0
Works great. Velcro straps are low quality. Grab a bag of wide zip ties to go with this product.,4.0
Easy to put together and hold up very well. I am very impressed considering the price.,4.0
"Not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. I was looking for something quick and inexpensive.",4.0
"Heavy duty, much better than those flimsy pastiche bases.",4.0
Bought these for my little league team. Works good for practice. Do not run across them with steal cleats.,4.0
"Love it - easy to assembly, large and sturdy",4.0
Product works as per its description. good buy for my little one.,4.0
"Trade off between carrying weight, price and durability.  After a season of 8YO youth practice the bases have holes in the top from the kid's cleats and will need to be replaced for next season.  They are not too heavy for carrying to and from practices and the are not too expensive.",4.0
Nice sturdy bases. A bit overpriced but great product.,4.0
"These bases are a bit heavy to carry, but their weight prevents them from moving around much during play. After a few games, I noticed a small tear here and there in the rubber, but they are generally pretty sturdy.",4.0
Much better than making one out of PVC.  Kids love it.  They helped with the easy assembly. Only gave 4 as we don't know how long the net will hold up yet.,4.0
Super nice for kids,4.0
"The size and quality are good for a backyard, not too big, not too small. I would have liked the weave to have been smaller, but my grandkids love it as it is.",4.0
Very good for our 3 kids.  Durable.,4.0
Good product for the money.  Easy to assembly and light weight for easy moving.,4.0
"durable and solid, kids enjoy using them and have taken them to the park to play some scrimmages, Recommend them.",4.0
"Heavy duty quality, remains in place even without the stakes.  The Velcro straps started breaking pretty quickly, so I'm looking for an alternative method of stronger straps to replace them.",4.0
Good stuff,4.0
"Nice, easy to assemble.",4.0
Very heavy bases.  They are well made ad I can tell will last through many years of playing.,4.0
Good sturdy bases. These aren't the flimsy ones that rip easily. These have the waffle backing to give it more structure.,4.0
It was a little difficulty to put together because one of the holes was punch out wrong and a metal piece was stuck in the inside of the bar. Once it was put together it is what I expected.,4.0
"The nets are great, but wish they were a bit sturdier for my son who is too rough and strong beyond his age.",4.0
Good size for the backyard.,4.0
I love this soccer goal it takes about 30 minutes to setup but why i only gave it a 4 star is because the Velcro straps and pretty bad i would recommend using zip ties.,4.0
EZ to assemble. Perfect size for U 8 players.,4.0
I purchased this for my son to practice with in the back yard. The bases are well made and will easily hold up over time.,4.0
Bought as a gift for our grandson but haven't used them yet.  The quality is good for the price paid.,4.0
"These are great recreational bases to play ball with for the money. The added advantage of them being raised a half inch allows them to stay put on the ground and not flip an edge over like the super cheap store ""place mat"" style bases.",4.0
"Correct size, but I recommend not using the included velctros to hold the net as they fall of frequently with hard kicks; use zipties instead. All in all its a good goal however its a little wobbly but thats to be expected from its size and material, very light, can be carried by two people.",4.0
"I coach a girls 9-10 competitive soccer team and had trouble getting fields reserved so I decided to get a pair of these to practice on.

The frame was pretty easy to assemble and the Velcro straps have been holding up fine for me.  One of the nets has started fraying at the knots in the middle but I'll tie them up and burn the ends to keep it together.  The horizontal tubes go together with spring loaded button deals and the triangulated supports are held with 1/4"" bolts and wing nuts.

I was hoping they would break down for transport more easily but the best you can do is pop them apart and fold it into thirds if you want to make it lay flat.  When you go to put it back up it gets tangled up and is kind of a pain.  We ended up using a trailer to pull them to and from the fields so they could stay assembled.  The wing nuts wanted to spin off so we put on some nylon lock nuts to keep them tight.  I'd recommend a different solution for portable nets but these work really well in the back yard for the kids to play with now that the spring season has wrapped up.",4.0
Awesome goal! Ours sits in our yard and has yet to be bothered by weather. Has stood up against two rough boys!,4.0
"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park,  t-ball, baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store, haul, carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!",4.0
"Heavy duty, thick, it's a very good set of bases.  If you leave them outside for too many months they seem to fall apart.",4.0
"First impressions are this is a nice goal for the size and price. The braces in the back add support to a goal that would wobble a lot without them so that's a plus I only took a couple shots at the goal, so I haven't truly tested it but if definitely seems like it can withstand a lot, I'm gonna put it through its paces and see how it holds up",4.0
I am very pleased with this soccer goal.  The kids love it.,4.0
My kids and neighbor kids have really enjoyed this.  Seems pretty decent so far.  The top bar did bend when a kid grab a hold of it but it really isn't made well enough for that.  Overall I am pleased.  We don't have it anchored in the ground and they where kicking pretty hard goals 9-14 yr old boys and it wasn't moving.,4.0
"Sure met the need, could use another one.",4.0
better than cardboard good value. Because I use ratings to make my purchase decisions I am paying forward on the idea with a review myself.,4.0
This is a good goal to have for a young kid who likes to kick a soccer ball around the yard.,4.0
works as expected a bit hard to put together,4.0
"We bought this for our nephew when he was five years old. It lasted a good five years. He would use it in the back yard for the spring, summer, and fall then it was stored in the garage the winter. He got plenty of use out of it.",4.0
"For the price, you can't go wrong. It is very sturdy.",4.0
This was great fun to put together.  But well worth it in the end.,4.0
Purchased this for my grandson for Christmas to practice soccer.  He loves it and moves it all around the yard.  Worth the money.,4.0
"Now that we've had a set of these goals for a while, I can give an honest review.  They are great for the money.  However, the do get rusty on the connections if left outside.  I live in Southern Cali where the climate is pretty good all year round, but even here they are taking a beating since we don't have a storage space and we left them up all year. They are under the sprinklers every day from late spring through summer.  Also, the Velcro strips with the sun and water are starting to fall apart.

Also worth noting, it came without straps.  So I called Franklin and they sent two sets of straps for free without any problem and they arrived pretty fast.  Kudos to Franklin for great customer service!",4.0
"This is a pretty good goal (it serves its purpose to kick the goal into a perimeter) but the straps are not durable. Any hard kicks to the ball and the straps come flying off as soon as the soccer ball makes contact with the net. This issue was easily fixed with some zip ties. The only other issue is weather (rain). The unit has rusted a lot were the tubes connect and will drip and stain what ever surface it is on, if water stores in tubes). Have owned this item for 14 months and it is still standing! The net has been undamaged in any way. We love having this goal to practice and play games. The $ was not bad at all for the easily fixed strap issue and size, the rust, well, haven't work on that issue yet.",4.0
This item will serve its purpose but I am sure it will not last long.,4.0
"after almost a year of using this, the netting is cheap and falls apart easily.",4.0
"My son loves his goal.  It's 6' x 12, and took several family members to assemble.  Drawback is that it must be disassembled to store inside.",4.0
Great net for the price. It is almost a year old and it is still in one piece!  My boys love it,4.0
"For smaller (4-7) children just gaining interest/ability in sports this is a nice goal.  It was easy to assemble with the provided instructions and is sturdy enough for the force exerted on it by small children.  It is also light enough  to be moved around by a single person with no difficulty.  My one concern in purchasing this was that the velcro tabs that hold the net to the frame might fray, but so far they have held up.",4.0
"We have had this goal for over a year now and it has held up quite well with daily use by many of the neighborhood children. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the Velcro attachments that hold the net in place on the frame have long since worn out, been replaced by the extras included with the goal, and eventually been replaced by electrical tape when we ran out of those.  This goal gets a lot of heavy use, however, so the Velcro may hold up much better with easier use of the goal.",4.0
"Great quality over all, but keep it out of the rain.  After one storm it got some water in the frame and when I drained it there was orange water coming out after one day.  Otherwise it was easy to set up, but took some time to fix the net with the Velcro tabs.  Maybe 10-15 minutes to put together.  I like the button locks in the frame which make it easy to snap together and take apart.  It can take a lot of space to store unless you take it all apart.  Over all it was a great buy and my son loves it!",4.0
My 11 year old son and his siblings love this goal in the backyard. It was easy to assemble and sturdy.,4.0

Grandsons love it!,4.0
"SET UP: a breeze *****

FRAME: Seems sturdy enough, though the top bar seems a little chinsy. My 10 year old already has had ""fun"" trying to pull it down. A few scratches and dings. I thought about applying Rustoleum clear coat prior to setting it up. Chose not to apply it. I might still apply it now that I set it up.  LIGHTWEIGHT---easy to move with one 7 year old. ****

NETTING: thin nylon with velcro straps to attach to frame.  Seems fine for younger kids.  ****

PRICE: ****

Overall: ****",4.0
"Great item for the price.  Bought this as a gift for my son.  He really likes it and the quality is good.  Only complaint is that it takes a bit of time to put it together, but overall we're pleased.",4.0
No complaints so far. I have had it for 2 months and my 10 year old son loves it. I have just ordered a second one for our backyard. SCA,4.0
"Easy to set up and lightweight so we can move it around the yard.  It will also be easy to take down and store in the winter.  My son and his friends are out there every day playing soccer and it is the right size for 8 year old soccer as this net dimensions are close to what they use in games.  Would give it 5 stars but the aluminum is very light and my son jumped up on the cross bar and grabbed it and it bent.  That said, for the money and for backyard soccer it more than met our needs.",4.0
"Easy setup, works great for young players.",4.0
Works well and fairly easy setup that will take about a half hour.,4.0
"Great nets....especially for the price, you cant beat it. I would say -- the only down side is the fact that the Velcros don't do that well with a powerful shot...

Other than that, it takes like 5 minutes to set up and works as promised",4.0
"Vecro holds net, but it slips along the bar and bunches in corners over time...net isn't very well constructed and can be stretched/ripped if ball is driven in by adult...comes with stakes to secure goal for kids play. Very good size and very happy overall",4.0
Great gift...excellent quality.,4.0
The frame seems like it is sturdy. The only issue is that the top crossbar sags a little towards the middle but that is understandable. I wish there was a better way of fastening the net to the goal other than velcro. Other than that it works great.,4.0
This soccer goal is simple but sturdy.  The only downside is the Velcro that come in the package to hold on the net is useless and broke off easily.  Replace with stronger Velcro and now it is perfect.,4.0
"I bought this as a gift to a couple of young soccer players.  They love it and use it all the time.  Yes, I would recommend it.  It's just the right size for backyard/driveway practice and is light and easy to pick up and move or put away.",4.0
No problem assembling but make sure you wrap the Velcro tabs correctly and they won't come loose. The snap buttons are a great feature for assembly and then disassembly for winter storage/,4.0
My children and I have had loads of fun with this. My children love being goallie. The one downside is that the velcro tabs for holding the net in place have begun to snap. Easily remedied by some california handcuffs.,4.0
"The whole family uses this for backyard practice, then we put in the back of the truck to take to the park for team practice. Go Team!",4.0
"Our grand son loved it so much , we got him a 2nd one for his Birthday in January.  Now he has a full soccer field in his backyard.",4.0
"Nice goal , except the Velcro keepers were poorly sewn so some failed immediately

Met all expectations.  Had a good price.  It seemed to be a good quality for young boys to play with and not destroy it immediately.,4.0
"The sturdiness is better than expected.  I has been outside since Christmas day and has not moved an inch, regardless of the snow, wind and rain that we've had.  My son and his friends love it.",4.0
"My husband coaches my sons soccer team and he wanted a goal he could set up in our yard. This goal is well made and seems sturdy enough for backyard play. I like the way the metal poles lock together because they are sturdy, but you can also take them apart to move or store the goal. The net is nice, but I do have concerns about how the Velcro strips that tether it to the goal will hold up. I suppose I can always use zip ties if need be. All in all, for the price, this is a pretty good goal.",4.0
Made of durable steel post as to not easily move around or blow away.  Our Grandson can't wait to set it up to play.,4.0
"The velcrow to hold the net on is terrible! Had to put zipties on the first day, so that my boys could keep playing!",4.0
Very nice goal The construction of the frame is very strong. But the velcro they give you is crap. I replaced all the velcro with large zip ties.,4.0
"Great little goal for the price, assembly a chimp could manage, decent quality, and the kids lost their collective minds.  Not robust,, not a tournament caliber goal or any such thing, but perfect for the side yard and a bit of soccer fun for the wee ones.  Quite happy with the purchase.

q",4.0
"Pros: Installation was easy, it was just right size for backyard, and frame sturdy enough to absorb some shots with pretty good power from a U13G premier player (we had another goal before that the frame just fell apart).

Cons: The cross bar does sag a little. The connections not tight enough, so it does shake a bit. The worst part is that the velcro strap are worthless. Basically every shot my daughter took would break a strap (velcro still sticking, but the strap just snaps). That was fixed by buying a pack of cable straps from home depot.",4.0
Everything went together smoothly and quickly. Perfect size for the back yard. Seems sturdy but does have a slight sag in the middle . Helpful tip is to forget those velcro strips and weave/thread the rods through the net loops for better securing. A couple of hard kicks and you will be constantly reattaching the velcro straps,4.0
"This goal is easy to assemble, a good sturdy constructed product.  I would recommend using cable ties to attach the net as the Velcro straps start to loose power after time out in the weather.",4.0
"I was not looking forward to putting this together for the kids (9 & 6), but set up was actually pretty easy.

I bought some extra ties to secure the net as I just can't see the velcro attachments lasting too long, but so far so good.

The product exceeded my expectations and is great for the backyard.  Both of my boys are travel caliber and I have no worries of the ball going through the net on hard kicks.

Good bang for the buck - if you're on the fence and you're buying for 16 & under crowd, it's a no brainer.

UPDATE 8/2/13:  It's about 2 years later and this sucker won't die.  In my backyard braving the elements.  The net is still stopping balls. Only a few velcro attachments left, but ties seem to work better anyway.  Definitely got my money's worth of this sucker and when it finally breaks down, will buy another.",4.0
"The product was easy to put together. It is fairly well-made. It is not super heavy duty, and we'll probably want to get sand bags as the anchors are a bit of a joke.. It's pretty good sized and well made for the money. It's still early though so I don't know how long it will last",4.0
"Good item, easy to assemble (took me 1.5 hrs, total). Was missing a wing nut that cost me $2 to replace. Also, bought additional wire ties to secure net around the goal. Kid loves it and it looks great.",4.0

- A bit on the flimsy side.  My kids are young (<6 years), so they will be fine.  I can see these being too flimsy for older kids though.
- Stakes are useless.  My backyard has some rocky soil.  Almost all of the stakes bent when I tried securing the nets.  And the ones that didn't bend didn't stay in the ground long.
- Easy to put together.  I had both of them together in under an hour.
- Velcro net attachments.  These made assembly pretty easy, but we'll see how they hold up.

Overall, I would recommend these for young kids in the backyard.",4.0
"These goals work well, they are a little rickety and it doesn't help that the kids tend to hang on them, but they seem to be holding up fairly well. The connections are these spring buttons to which the little thimbles (the button part that you press) have a tendency, some of them, to fall out, leaving a rather sharp piece of wire sticking out. The goals I bought have to be transported to and from the field, and I have a feeling that if the net were attached tightly to the frame, then one could take apart all the connections for transport and easily put them back together again, although the connectors might be more likely to do that thing I just described if they are assembled and disassembled many times. They are quite light and easy to carry, even while put together.",4.0

"I got this on sale during black Friday.  The pair had some minor scratches on the knob for adjusting focus and one of the lens cups was a bit loose so I deducted a star.

These binoculars work well. The 4 lens caps are a bit loose but aside from that this is a very decent pair of binocs. The carrying case is adequate but soft so store them carefully.

great binoculars for any price. I'm a beginner bird watcher and went birding with a friend for the first time. It was great to zoom in on some really cool colorful birds.  Easy to adjust focus once you follow the directions under thier product description.  Only down falll is there is no strap to hang them around your neck and that is why the 4 stars.  Otherwise I am very happy with them.,4.0

Pleased with the Bushnell Binoculars. I keep them in my truck and use my expensive binoculars for hunting.,4.0
Arrived on time and work great. Thanks!,4.0
"For what it is, it serves the purpose. The right-eye adjustment is a bit too easy to kick out of place, however. My 8yo had no trouble with it. My 5-6yo could just barely reach the focus control and needed some coaching, but figured it out ok. It is great for getting the kids interested in nature and exploration.",4.0
"For the price these binoculars are satisfactory, we went on a cruise and they gave good close up views of the shoreline which is what we wanted.  They give a clean, sharp view of scenery at a distance.  I liked the focus adjustment, it was easy to use.  .I've never owned a pair of really good binoculars so I have nothing with which to compare.",4.0

"Better than I expected for $23 binoculars.  They feel very well made. Includes nice neoprene soft case and nylon strap.  Quick focus lever is handy for quick random looks from the car while stuck in traffic.  Small size fits easily in glove compartment.  Wide 8.2 degree field of view.  Collimation was good out of the box.  They don't look crosseyed.  Eye relief is reasonable.  Easier to use than folding compact binoculars.  Not as good as Nikon Aculon 7x35s, but ok for 1/3 the price.  Inexpensive so I won't worry if the kids use them.",4.0
Good enough.,4.0
They're not Nikons but not as expensive either. IDE buy more anytime. I purchased 8 for an eclipse party. The magnification makes it easy to hold without a shackey looking target,4.0

"as an engineer with optics experience, i can find a minor issue with these, but even so, they are well worth the money, and i would absolutely buy them again.  i took them with me on vacation and used them to watch birds on a nearby island.  for reference, i was able to read 2"" high numbers on a utility pole a thousand feet away as if they were 20 feet away.  on a house that was about a quarter mile away across the bay, i could easily see the patio furniture and electric meter on the side of the house.  without them, i could only tell there was a house there.

Just what I wanted. I was hoping they would b e smaller but I like them fine,4.0
"Love it. We purchased the Bushnell Falcon 133410 Binoculars for amateur bird watching and hopefully for star gazing. And it works wonderfully. The binoculars are little on the heavy side but easy to adjust focus and to use. The case and strap that came with the binoculars are of mediocre quality. It would have been helpful to have a more sturdy case and strap. Furthermore, you will need to attach the strap to the binoculars upon first use. Simply unfasten each of the buckles and slide each each end of the strap through the slots located at the bottom of the binoculars. Then, run them through the buckles twice before adjusting the length. The binoculars also come with a cleaning cloth and 4 lens covers. The lens covers fit easily but not a tight fit and can fall off easily. Hence, one less star based on the above observations for the accessories.",4.0
Ordered 2 pair for gifts. The one had a strange dull view and the other one was perfect  Yes would recommend this item,4.0
My wife and I are avid bird watches.  We found the be crystal clear and very easy to use with the winged focusing adjustment.,4.0
awesome binoculars they have clear vision not too big or too small they are the perfect  sizeyou can see really clear and pretty far with them they do fill light witch im guessing because its mostly made off plastic so they probably brake pretty easy the reason i gave them 4 stars is because when i receive them the box was damage,4.0

I only used these once. I purchased them for a cruise. They worked pretty well. I had a balcony and would just sit and zoom in on the islands we were approaching.

Good value,4.0
"These are quite good for the price.  I have 5 sets of binoculars of various sizes ranging from 10X25 to 15X70.  These are good all around utility binoculars for daytime use, looking out over the water from the beach or for a day of hiking.  They are comfortable in the hand and comfortably light to carry.  I have never gotten them wet but they are not advertised as waterproof so I would not use them in the rain.

I purchased them primarily for astronomy.  Many people never think to turn their binoculars toward the night sky but they will show you a lot more stars than you can see with the naked eye. These gather about 25 times more light than your eyes so dim stars become visible and some very nice star clusters become visible.  Also 7X is easier to hold steady than my 10X or 15X binoculars.",4.0

"I purchased the Bushnell Falcon binoculars because I needed to replace an older pair of Bushnells that sat in the sun too long and you could no longer get the left eye to come into focus.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money and I didn't want a big bulky pair either so after doing my research I settled on the Falcon 7x35s.

Pros - inexpensive, well made, lightweight, carry case, Bushnell quality, quick focus paddle
Cons - kind of big, case is cheap nylon, flimsy strap, lens covers don't fit well

With me I can overlook the cons that I listed because I am more interested in the actual operation of the binoculars.  I was very impressed with the field of view and the magnification.  For the price I don't think you can do any better!  They are really lightweight for the size and even if they work for a couple of years they are worth the cost.  They came well packed by Bushnell with everything you need right out of the box.  I'm sure you could spend a lot more and get much better quality but I don't think you will be disappointed with this purchase!  All photos in this review were taken by me.  I hope this helps you make an informed purchasing decision.  [...] Thanks for reading!",4.0
"Great vision, but just a little too heavy for what I wanted.",4.0
"For this price these are some great binoculars, and I recommend for anyone who wants to use them for casual bird watching. You can also take these to sports games, the zoo, or anywhere you anticipate being far away from the action.

"Hey, lets face it, you probably won't go broke buying these binoculars and for the price I think they work very well.  As others have mentioned, the lens caps have a tendency to drop right off but other than that they work pretty good.  When I initially received them one of the eyepieces was sticking slightly and wouldn't move in and out in sync with the other when focusing but it seems to have remedied itself.  I leave these sitting on an end table in the living room all the time and it allows me to get a close up view of an active eagles nest on the river.",4.0
"We just got it yesterday, and I do like it. It was exactly what I was looking for in terms of size. I worry that we maybe should have gotten a higher magnification, but after reading many reviews on several binoculars and many articles, we went with the lower magnification since these will be shared with our 7 year old, and I repeatedly read that anything over 7x or 8x can be a bit more difficult for kids. I am glad we went with the 35, though. Maybe later we'll get another one that is a higher magnification.

We bought these for a cruise so that we can look at the ports and such from our balcony, but we go on a lot of hiking trips and visit lots of national parks, so I think this will be a good buy for us long-term. Yesterday evening we played with it a little while playing baseball at our neighborhood park, and I was able to see 2 stars close to the moon that could not be seen with the naked eye. I pointed them out to my husband, and he saw them as well. This was when it was still very light outside. Once the sun set and it was darker, we could then see the stars without the binoculars, and I thought that was neat. I did not use the binoculars at night yet.

Also, we live near the airport, and it was fun to look at the details of the plains passing overhead. Another clue on the detail, when we were at the park I was looking down the street and was able to see details on street signs about a block and a half to 2 blocks away.",4.0

"Excellent picture quality for the price. Easy to focus. The focusing lever sticks a bit at one end, so I am thinking whether it's too much trouble to exchange them, and whether it's just my copy's flaw or is common to all of them. This is the only reason for 4 and 5 stars, and I honestly feel bad for lowering the rating, because the optics (if not the mechanics) are outstanding. This was my first pair of binoculars: I got them for birding without doing too much research. They came up at the top when I searched ""best binoculars for birding"" and the price ($28.76) was easy to swallow even if they turned out to be a dud. I was so impressed with the picture quality (the seller uses ""HD clarity"" in the description and that seems spot on) that I became really curious if all binoculars are similar. I immediately bought a cheap pair of Vivitars with greater magnification and size (12x50 vs these being 7x35) and they turned out to be complete crap compared to these. Next, I borrowed a friendly birder's $1,000 Leupolds (something like these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leupold-Mojave-Roof-Prism-Binoculars-10x50mm-Black/dp/B004I8Q978/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leupold Mojave Roof Prism Binoculars, 10x50mm, Black</a>&nbsp;I think) which he thinks are outstanding. I agree, his are nice binoculars, but the image clarity and color resolution of Bushnells, to my unsophisticated eye, is the same. And the depth of focus is greater in Bushnells, as is the ease of focusing thanks to the lever. The only department, in which $1,000 (I guess they can be had for ""only"" $500 if you look) Leupolds outshine the sub-$30 Bushnells is they allow for closer minimum focusing distance. Think about it and whether it is worth the price. Having played with the Leupolds and the Bushnells I honestly would not trade them -- in part because I would hate to drop, scratch or smudge such a precious piece of equipment. I would, however, consider a more expensive Bushnell model -- now that I am familiar with the brand -- if it delivered real improvements in magnification, focusing distance or another characteristic.",4.0
"A nice pair of binoculars - which I find work best for me if the object is about a block away or less, or maybe I also need glasses - these don't work so well for reading books. They are fairly lightweight and so easy to use I've caught my cats with them a few times.",4.0

"No eye relief.  Its almost like your eyes need to be so close the binoculars are contact lenses.  Kids like them.  They are clear.  I could see Jupiters moons, but only because I knew what I was looking for.  They were salt grain dots in the sky by the yellow dot.  Which was cool.  Next step is aculon 211 then I'd say vortex series and then ed glass.  You lose light because the optics aren't state of the art, however they aren't thousands.  I thin if they upped the relief a bit or offered a 6x30 or 7x50 in similar price points that'd be great.  They are good enough but the relief is a distraction to me, the rest of the family don't seem to care.",4.0
"The Binoculars came on time as said. I am very happy with my purchase very much worth the money. It is going to make a great gift for my family member who loves to hunt.

"These are great for bird watching; however, the lense caps (4) are so loose that they do not stay on at all--but you need to use them so I get them on the best I can for storage & keep them in the bag.  I don't know what the answer is here as it would be awkward to have them attached by strings--they just need to fit better (perhaps testing them prior to selling them might be a good idea).  Do love the size & available adjustments so for the price, I'm a happy camper.",4.0
Great for long range surveillance! been hunting for the thief that keeps on getting all the valuables in my car at night. I was able to caught him in the act because f this very powerful and reliable binoculars!,4.0
Good price works good for the price,4.0
Really worth to buy this product. Good price.,4.0
"Was skeptical due to a few poor reviews. Pulled the trigger anyway and am very pleased. At this price it's a no brainer. Easy lens focus, solid and good optics. Four stars because minor blemish's on eye cups and wish both eye pieces had focal adjustment instead of just the right eye. Like other reviews protective caps not attached. No biggee. Put them in the included carry bag or your pocket/purse.",4.0

nice binoculars. really needed this in my camping trip.,4.0
I originally bought these for my son but ended up going a different route only because my son is 7 and I thought he needed something lighter.  Part of me would have loved to just give him these but decided not to.  I did not try these out and returned them.  Can't really give a review on use.,4.0
good quality,4.0
Good for the price!,4.0
good buy for the money use them to sit on my deck and watch the birds thrilled when I could see an owl so close,4.0
"Okay for the money. Bought these and wife liked them so I gave them to her then tried to buy myself another pair and they were out so I bought the Bushnell 10 X 35 for $10 more and they are way better. Wife uses mine all the time now and these went to the kids. Still, good for the money.",4.0
"An exceptional go-everywhere gadget, these Bushnell Falcon 7 x 35mm Binoculars are a wonderful companion for sporting events, sightseeing outings, nature study, stormwatching, birdwatching, backpacking, and the list just goes on!

They feature a Porro prism system to provide a wide field of view. You can enjoy a crisp, sharp, and bright magnified view due to the power and 7X magnification of these Bushnell binoculars. The 35mm fully-coated objective lens offers superior light transmission and good resolution, while reducing blur. These porro prism binoculars also have an InstaFocus system for quick focus on moving objects. The auto focus feature automatically adjusts for an accurate view. These Bushnell Falcon 7 x 35mm Binoculars have non-slip rubber grip pads for a secure hold and easy handling in all weather conditions and come with a soft carrying case, with optional shoulder strap. Total weight is about 2 pounds.

Solid investment for birdwatching in my opinion!",4.0
"These are the least expensive binoculars that I have purchased and yet I find myself using them more than many of my other ones. They are compact and versatile in that they meet most situations where I need a set of binoculars (i.e. watching birds, watching concerts, watching air shows, spying on the neighbors... etc. The quality far exceeds the price.",4.0
"Very good value for the money.  Great for occasional use, especially if here are no others in the household.  They are nice to have near the window to see wildlife in the back yard 50 to 100+ feet away.  There are certainly better binoculars available.  If these were twice the price, I would only rate them 2 or 3 stars.  I am NOT using these in any high use nor professional endeavor.  I bought them as gifts; I used them for several hours over a week; I would buy them again.",4.0
Bushnell makes a great product I am very happy with my purchase of these binoculars,4.0
"Thought I knew how to use binoculars, but these have some getting used to in use. Nicely packaged and really like that the case for storage came with them.",4.0
"These are a great pair of basic binoculars. I was impressed with the clarity and the ease of focusing. I use them all the time for casual nature watching.

The reason for the one star deduction is because the Insta-Focus bar had a little too much play in the button. It feels sloppy. It works well but makes it feel cheap. Granted these are cheap and they are much better than expected for the price so I have no major complaints on the value.",4.0
Very wide range and aperture. I used this in our backyard and spotted a lot of things that my unaided eye could not. 7x35 is pretty high.,4.0
"Great set of binocs for backyard birding. Great price, quick focus, nice small size. Leave it on a parlor table for fast access to the local birds.",4.0

Very good binocular for the price . I'm happy with it and I would recommend it.,4.0
"Got this for my brother as a cheap accessory for night sky observing. He reports it works quite well and he gets good views with it. He's not real picky about optics, though he is a very accomplished observer.  It's a relatively stubby and compact design. So for a cheap pair of binoculars that you won't get upset about if you knock it out of alignment or lose it, this appears to be a good value. One of the lens caps was cracked when I received it, but they get lost anyway. Nice that it comes with a soft case and basic straps.",4.0
Very powerful for such an inexpensive binocular.,4.0

Great for our grandson - he enjoys birdwatching,4.0
This product is really good for a small hunting pack. Not the most high powered binoculars but they are perfect for the value.,4.0
Obviously not a super high quality expensive model but very affordable and works well for the money. Very happy with the purchase.,4.0
Bought as gift for bird watching but tried them first.  Good clarity and distance viewing.  Easy to focus especially for young kids.,4.0
Work as expected.  I bought two of them. Thank you.,4.0
Son loves them,4.0
"I adjusted these per the instructions (as well as confirming with different online instructions) and was still seeing double images. I ended  up returning them for another pair rather than trying to collimate myself (requiring adjusting the screws closest to the barrel). I noted that one of the lens covers was cracked so I suspect it got dropped on the way, throwing the lens out of alignment. The new pair just arrived and they work just fine...not too different from my husband's ancient 10X50s (also Bushnell).",4.0
Excellent product arrived after Xmas though,4.0
"When I first experimented with them, I thought they should be illegal as I focused on the neighbor's home across the street & could see everything so clearly!  This is not the reason I bought them.  Instead, I use them for traveling and also to view wildlife, abundant in my neighborhood.  The only negative is I thought they might be a bit lighter in weight.  I would still highly recommend this product.",4.0
work good for things that are not too far away.,4.0
Bought to take to a concert. They worked well but were bigger and heavier than I expected.  I should have read the description better!,4.0

"These are great starter binoculars, they are worth what you pay!",4.0
"These work well and I'm pleased with them.  As much as others seemed to like the focus, I'm not as thrilled with it.  It's easy enough, but also easy to accidentally hit and unfocus.  For the most part though, they're pretty good!",4.0
Very nice. Worked out great at the track.,4.0
"Good purchase for the price, and work well for what I needed them for.",4.0
Good bargain for the price.  The binoculars work well for bird watching here at my mountain cabin.  I recommend them for their price.,4.0

"These binoculars get the job done for me.  Optics and build quality seem very good for the price.  They went super cheap on the lens covers.  It's impossible to keep them on, so I stopped trying.

I also don't love the focus mechanism.  It's quick and handy, but imprecise.

Recommended overall.  I couldn't find anything better in the price range.",4.0

I ordered these binoculars for my mom she had no complaints,4.0
Surprisingly good quality for such a low price.,4.0
Very nice glasses for the price.  Has a decent field of view and very clear.,4.0
"These are basic binoculars. They have a fixed focal length. They focus quickly. We bought these to use on a deck for bird and other critter watching.

The clarity is acceptable but not impressive. At 7x the binoculars are really limited to specific uses.

While I see several shortcomings in these binoculars in order to resolve the shortcomings I would need to spend perhaps 10x the price I paid for these. If you realize that you are getting more than you are paying for by some small amount with this product (and for the price they are very good) then you will enjoy these binoculars. I certainly to.",4.0
"This is a basic binocular, similar to the model I bought years ago when I began birdwatching in college. I still use my 40 year old pair. This new pair is to replace my husband's 30 year old pair (same model and still functional) that was lost. I'm delighted to see that Bushnell still makes them, and still with insta focus. The only way they could be better is if they were waterproof for use in the kayak.",4.0

The binoculars are perferct for viewing. I have used them on the Lake to view the landscape. I even used them to view the moon during the full moon. I am satisfied with the purchase.,4.0
I just needed a pair of binoculars that would only be used about 50 times a year so I didn't see any reason to spend a lot of money . This pair fits the bill and is adequate.,4.0
"This pair of glasses could readily spot the creatures that I was interested with and it was easy to teach the young 'uns how to use them. The images were fine for an amateur birdwatcher, well defined and free of distortion.",4.0
Overall it's pretty good except I can't seem to do much adjusting on the focus. It does not give you much to play with when focusing.,4.0
"Bought two of these for our grandchildren (ages 5 and 8) for Easter instead of candy.  They loved having their own set to use.  It has opened up a whole new world for them.  They are looking at birds, clouds, flowers, airplanes and everything else that moves.  The binoculars are easy to use with the included strap.  The case is a great bonus.  Only problem is the lens covers don't stay on the binoculars.",4.0

We bought these for our Alaskan Cruise and we weren't disappointed. We didn't want to spend a lot of money on binoculars because we knew we wouldn't be using them except on vacations. They did the job- and we were glad we had them.,4.0
"These are well priced and work fine. Got them for a gift for a bird watching friend. She says, they are light and are easy to adjust.",4.0
"I bought these to take camping and hiking with me. They are big but that was my mistake. The lenses focus very well and it helps me see animals that are farther away. I felt like I was able to get within feet of elk, moose, big horn sheep, and bears. I'd buy another smaller pair to take with me hiking from the same company.",4.0
"Vision adjustment works with incredible ease.  Viewing is great.
My only problem with them is they're rather heavy and bulky.

Wow!  What a great pair of binoculars for the price.  I was amazed at the quality! They came with their own case also.,4.0
"My husband and I each received a pair of the Bushnell Falcon binoculars from our wonderful son in law.  Since my husband retired, we have both discovered the joys of bird watching.  However, we only had one pair to share that are not very clear.  These are so lightweight and the clarity and magnification are incredible.  Best of all, are the fold down eyecups.  We both wear eyeglasses and had difficulty seeing clearly.  With these, we are able to really enjoy our hobby without the glare and distraction we have encountered when trying other brands of binoculars.",4.0
"These are good, basic, serviceable field glasses for birdwatching. They're low priced and lightweight. Exactly what I was looking for.",4.0
"The binoculars are well made.  They are very easy to focus, and good for viewing animals, sports events,  and scenery.  I would recommend them to someone who needs a basic pair.",4.0
"I searched for and bought these binoculars online within a week of a trip to Alaska.  I read the reviews before buying.  They seemed like a pretty good pair at a good price.  While I knew they weren't the best out there, I didn't want to pay a lot.  They served me well in Alaska, both in sight-seeing them from the cruise ship and while touring on land.",4.0
"Considering, these are a very inexpensive pair of binoculars, they arrived in great shape, came with a carrying case and a cleaning cloth. They focus pretty well and have a decent field of vision. If you just want to look at a birdbath in your backyard, these would suit you quite well. If you want to do more serious birding or scouting, buy a more expensive pair. For the money, they are a nice lightweight pair of binoculars.",4.0
just what I need for my trip. I would  have liked a more handy binoculars but found out that this item works so good.,4.0

- Somewhat hard to adjust lenses
- Clear image
- As for the zoom, not as expected",4.0
"I purchased these for two purposes.  The immediate use was a hike along the Nova Scotia shoreline.  These proved easy to carry on the hike and were good for relatively nearby objects (e.g., birds, nearby islands, etc.).  Secondly, I use these on local hikes mostly for bird sightings.  They are great - easy and quick focus, good quality and perfect for fast access.  Overall, very happy with these.",4.0
"I bought the binoculars for a first time birding experience.  I did not want to spend a lot of money, nor did I have a lot. These binoculars worked very well, after I figured out how to properly use binoculars.  There are definitely not the best out there, there are others that can see further away and give a sharper image of a bird, but if you are not going out to do Big Year these will work very well.",4.0
"I bought it for our recent trip to the whale watching and i am really happy with this product. It has worked out quite well with the price range and the purpose i was looking for. Easy to focus and nice handy. Not so long bulky and you can easily carry it out with ease.

"I got one pair for my wife and one for me.  They were such a great deal, I figured we should both have one.  We have them on hooks right by the front door.  That way, anytime we see a bird out the window, we can grab the binocs and check it out.  We've also brought them on a couple outings.  They are easy to carry around and are of excellent quality!",4.0
"The reason I purchased these binoculars is because I am a hummingbird dvote and I like to see what birds are using my feeders.  I have to be about 12' from the Hummingbirds so as to not disturb them and, being as small as they are, these binoculars have worked out just right.",4.0
"Having to need to get a pair of binocular, but notwanting to pay an arm and leg, i settled on this product.  It fits my purpose on my budget.",4.0
"You get what you pay for.  Price vs. product, these are good binoculars.  They are definitely not top quality glasses, the case and lens covers are garbage (you get what you pay for), but for about $25, they aren't bad.",4.0
"Good, basic binoculars for occasional use. Easy to use, adjust, and transport. Won't worry if we lose or drop it.",4.0
"These are at the low end price-wise for binocs but for an amateur wildlife-watcher like me they are fine.  I really, really like the insta-focus thing.  It's much easier to use than the type where you turn a central knob.  You can scan from near to far and easily change the focus as you go.  Might want to invest in a more comfortable strap if you are going to use them for long periods.  Also, the lens caps don't all fit real snugly----one or two tend to just fall off.",4.0
Good backyard bird-watching binocular for the money. Would recommend these to anyone for this purpose. The mechanism is a littl loose so it can focus easily but can move easily too.,4.0
Product arrived very quickly.  I like the size.  They aren't mini ones that you can easily carry around but they are not so large that they will be a burden to carry around.,4.0
"We will be cruising to Alaska and these binoculars feel easy to use and it come with a case and straps. I bought it after reading all the positive reviews. After our trip, I will update upon its real use.",4.0
"This is my first pair of binoculars, so take this review with that precaution in mine.

That being said, I purchased these to use while hunting.  I have yet to test them in anything but good conditions, and I will update my review accordingly if need be.  The item is bigger than expected, and heavier too.  It is comfortable to look through and has a very nice focus adjustment positioned perfectly for on the fly focusing without changing hand position.  The binoculars came with a nice strap to carry around the next and a decent case with covers for both ends of the lens.

I would have given a 5 star review if the unit was a little smaller and lighter, but overall I can't complain.  I tested up to about 350 ft with incredible clarity.",4.0
The binoculars are being used by children.  Not too heavy to wear around the neck and very easy to focus.,4.0
"I wanted these because my dad had a similar pair in the 1950s-60s, although this is an updated version.  Center focus lever works good,  They're fairly heavy compared to little pocket binocs, but the image is a lot brighter, so you can see more detail.  The 7x power is good, less vibration effect compared to 8x and 10x.

"Solid metal construction, easy assembly, rugged parts.
If I have any complaint its that the seat height adjustment is a bit lame. Its no more than a thread rod that tightens against the seat post. My son is tall and heavy (at 3 most people think hes 5) and the post tends to wiggle its way down and need to be raised every few days. Not a big deal, and a functional solution for infinite adjustability, but mildly annoying.
The bell... well, that got lost during assembly. ;-)",4.0
"Bought this tricycle for our granddaughter and she loves it!!!  It's the perfect size for her.  The only problem is the white stripe on the wheels.  They are not painted neatly.  Very jagged,  mainly on the big wheel, but also on the smaller wheels.",4.0

"I really wanted to like this bike (well, trike). We got it for our 4-year-old daughter, who loves to ride around outside and even inside the house.  And she loves red, and she loves tassels, and she loves ringing bells.  And for us, well -- Radio Flyer is classic!  We couldn't wait to give this to her, and we imagined all the fun she was going to have, and the memories she would have of this really cool, classic bike.

This was our Christmas gift to her; her face lit up like our Christmas tree when she unwrapped it and saw it.  Of course, we had to assemble it first, and that's where I noticed that it wasn't as well-designed as I thought a ""classic"" should be.

- The main bar that mates with the dual-deck platform didn't go in smoothly; I had to use a rubber mallet to pound it slowly into position. But the guide clamp was tight, so it scratched up the nice red paint on the main bar.

- Once the bar was in place, the holes for the 2 screws to bolt it into place didn't line up properly.  I had to put on the first screw, and then wrestle with the deck a little bit, so I could get the holes aligned, and put the second screw through.  I was expecting a bit more precision in the manufacturing.

- The front wheel guard was slightly misaligned, relative to the wheel itself.

- The front wheel has a plastic stem that serves as a guide and a limiter for how far you can turn the wheel in either direction, by sliding into a slot/groove, but the plastic stem doesn't seem that sturdy.  I can imagine that thing snapping if the wheel gets turned too far.

- The handlebars need some kind of slot or guide, to keep them properly aligned with the front wheel.  As it is, it relies on the clamp and the hatching on the base of the handlebar.  With enough force (and not actually that much), it was possible to misalign the handlebars and the wheel.

- The bell is a little hard to ring, for little hands.  Our daughter actually has to stop pedaling, and use both hands to ring the bell.

- The way the seat is attached is pretty iffy.  Considering that it's holding the rider's weight, the bolt that tightens/locks the seat into place from just one side doesn't seem like enough.  It would be better to have a bolt go all the way through, and through a hole in the base/stem of the seat.

We were able to get the bike assembled, but I just couldn't let all these design/build issues slide.  We let our daughter ride it, but I make sure to tighten everything each time before she goes for a spin.  It shouldn't have to be that way.

Overall, it still looks good, and every bit the classic red Radio Flyer.  But it's better to look at than to actually ride, and that's a shame, considering it's a bike.

**********

UPDATE: bumping this up a couple of stars, not so much for the product, but for the stellar customer service.  Radio Flyer responded to my comments and worked with me to see what could be done to resolve the issues.  They offered to send some replacement parts for the parts that didn't fit so well.  They also helped me out with a fix (WD40!) for the squeaky rear wheels and now it glides along so quietly, I sometimes don't hear my daughter coming!

I still can't give it an overall 5 though, because the handlebar mating design really is a flaw -- it should have a more solid lock -- and the seat stem being supported only from one side also seems like a design flaw.

But I can't say enough about how great the customer service is.  6 stars!",4.0
"We just got this tricycle for my 2yr olds birthday. One of his friends had a small radio flyer, so we figured he would love this. I was a little irked that the tires looked so poorly painted. Otherwise, I have no issues with this tricycle. My son does love it.",4.0
great quality and reminds me of the old tricycle of yesteryear.,4.0
"Ordered 3 of these. They are nice, but do not seem to be as high of a quality as I had expected. The handlebars on one,  swing completely around - which they should not do.",4.0
"Love the trike, it looks fantastic. First impression is of good quality solid materials. It was a little big for our 2 year old (he can't reach the pedals at their furtherest point) but that is expected.
I think the the only negative point is that the metal seat is very slippery, our 5 year old slips from side to side when pedalling. Probably easy to fix with a cover.",4.0
Received and put together in 15 min looks nice,4.0
Pricey,4.0
"There are two very similar models for sale here.  There is a 10"" (wheel) model, and then there is THIS 12"" model.  The 10"" will fit a 2 year old.  This one is taller and fits like a 3.5-4 year old.  After we got the 6 year old a bike for his birthday, we tried to pass this down to the 4 year old, but he prefers being speedy on his much smaller trike, which works out because my bigger kid secretly prefers this to the bike.

PROS:
- 2nd kid can sort of piggyback/stand on the little platform in back.
- It ages well - We've left ours outside for awhile and it's finally starting to oxidize on the chrome, but the red paint is holding up well and it looks sort of vintage awesome with the rust!

CONS:
- not for a smaller kid
- has wheels that are a little harder to push due to the angle and the larger wheelbase",4.0
Good Product!,4.0
I had one as a kid and it all came full circle when I purchased one for my two year old. thrilled to share this with the next generation. Well made and infinitely sturdy!,4.0
The great-grandson liked it.,4.0
"The bike was awesome. It was difficult to put on the handle bars though. We needed a socket wrench to get it tight enough. If you have the right tools, it comes together nice.",4.0
"Pros:
* I love the sound of the dual-bell.
* the product photo shows a sticker on the front that reads ""Retro RED Made in China."" I'm happy that this is missing from the delivered item.
* the streamers are shorter than the photo but appear to be made out of a soft silicone or rubber (instead of the thin plastic as in the photo)
* includes an extra red cap
* solid rubber wheels

Cons:
* ARGH! RADIO FLYER'S PACKAGING DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST CHIPPED PAINT OR SCRATCHES DURING SHIPPING!  A few pennies worth of styrofoam could have prevented the paint from being chipped!  Radio Flyer's packaging appears to be designed for the tricycle to shipped on a pallet-- parts were minimally protected by bubble wrap and loose in the box.  There was no styrofoam to hold the metal parts in place and prevent the metal parts from rubbing against each other.  My tricycle arrived with scratches on the paint, red paint rubbed into the handlebar's chrome, and two 1/4-inch chips in the paint on the outside leg of the upper deck.  I'm assuming this happened during shipping from Amazon.com to my house.  This could have been prevented with a little bit of styrofoam to keep the parts in place in the package.
* the assembly manual states that the weight limit of the upper deck is 5 lbs
* the assembly instructions only mention grease/oil in fine print at the bottom of the last page.
* the upper deck's supports cause additional weld joints in the rear axle shaft that may scrape against the axle rod.  I inserted and removed the axle rod while greasing it, and the rod had 1/16-inch grooves in it from the metal spurs in the shaft left over from sloppy welding.  Perhaps this can be spun as a safety feature-- an always on parking brake.
* even with grease on the rear axle and front handlebar shaft, the tricycle still makes a rattling noise because the front fender is loosely attached to the front fork by two rivets and a 'W'-shaped metal standoff.  The lip of the front fork prevents wedging cardboard in-between to dampen the rattling.
* nit-pick: the bell should have a rubber boot around the thumb-lever, or the thumb-lever should be wider/thicker so it is less of a safety concern.  As a work-around, I tried to mound the bell with the lever at a slight downward angle such that the lever would not hit my kid's face if she ran into something and her head went forward into the handlebar.
* the item's photo shows a mirror finish on the fender, but the delivered item had more of a matte cloudy finish.
* the chrome plating on the top of the front frame (where the frame meets the handlebar) was already chipped away in several places when I opened up the package.

Assembly Tips:
* Grease the rear axle before hammering on the red cap.  Grease the peg above the front fork that goes into the limiter.
* Use a block of wood to steady and level the red cap when hammering it onto the rear axle.
* More than one size of wrench is needed for assembly.  Find the right wrench sizes before you begin assembly.  Don't use pliers like the instruction manual suggests.
* I had to pry apart the clamp to fit it all the way around where it goes on the front handlebar shaft.  It initially appeared to be on all of the way because the clamp had different top and bottom diameters, but when I saw the front wheel could jump out of the steering radius limiter, I then realized that the mismatched diameters were due cheap manufacturing of the clamp.
* Push the clamp all the way down so that the front wheel cannot jump out of the limiter.",4.0
Bike was nice looking and nice quality. Unfortunately my son could not quite reach the pedals even with pedal extenders. He is 2. And 94% for height. Maybe next summer,4.0
Great quality but need lifts on the pedals for grandson to be able to pedal. Almost 3 and feet still don't reach.,4.0
"Strong chemical smell. One year later, the smell is still a bit detectable. Purchased for our son for his 2nd birthday, but it was a bit too big at first. He is average size to almost a little big for age. Now that he is almost 3, he is the perfect size. Easy to assemble and sturdy.",4.0
"My granddaughter love it, a lot of my friends gave this Radio flyer a 4- thumbs-up",4.0
The first wheel we got was bent. Great service - sent whole new front wheel section. Works fantastic now. Adjustable seat has allowed my daughter to ride for years!,4.0
"My grandchild loves it and rides it everywhere, pretty sturdy but rear tires are slightly out of round, so it probably will be fine for her as she grows but not for more than 2/3 years. Well worth the price, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a trike for a youngster",4.0
"We love this trike and its vintage feel, but I would say that even on the lowest setting your child needs to be on the tall side of things to reach the peddles. My little one is small for her age and she had to grow into this. But otherwise it was great!",4.0
"Great tricycle, well built. The only issue is that my 3 year old is still too small to properly ride the tricycle. Looking forward to when she can ride it.",4.0
Nice Tricycle but kinda big... better fit for the average 4-5 year old.,4.0
Its a nice quality tricycle. Takes a bit of manual labor to assemble but worth it,4.0
"Its a decent tricycle for a young child, however you can definitely tell its made overseas based on the sloppy workmanship. The seat was dented, the front wheel rides slightly off-center, and there was a big piece of metal scrap embedded in one of the back tires I had to remove. Nothing is a show stopper, but less then happy with the quality control at Radio Flyer.
Note that this is a bit too big for my son who just turned 2. With the seat all the way down he cant easily touch the pedals when they are all the way down. He has to basically sit up on the bar to pedal, tho I'm sure he'll grow into it soon.",4.0
Great product grandson loves it. It is almost built as good as they were back in the sixtys.,4.0
We bought this for my son for his 3rd bday and he loved it! It's good quality and he's about to turn 5 and it's still one if his favorites.,4.0
"This is the classic we all grew up with. It's a little large for 2 probably just right for 2-1/2-3yrs as they claim on the box. It's big fun for the little ones. Mine had wheels that were not quite perfectly round but it did not seem to effect its performance, not really a high speed item...the wheels are made from soft metal. Easily worth the price for the smiles I got ",4.0
"Overall I like this bike. It's cute and our daughter loves riding it. I would just say a couple of things:

Our daughter is 3.5, average height for her age, and can only just reach the pedals; we have these blocks that strap onto the pedals to help her reach them. It's a bike for a 4yo or tall 3.5yo.

It was hard to assemble. In particular, there's no notch or even a line to help you get the handlebars aligned with the front wheel; we found it difficult to tighten the handlebars while keeping them lined up with the wheel. And the seat was bizarrely difficult to attach because of the angle at which the screw goes through.

The handlebars loosened after awhile and need to be tightened up periodically.",4.0
"Bought this for my 2 (soon to be 3) year old son for Christmas. Looks great. He is very happy with it, and loves to ring the bell. He has to stretch a bit to reach the pedals, but other than that it has been great. There is a risk of falling over if the tricycle is unbalanced, though. Just need to be careful and make sure child wears a helmet.",4.0
Very well built and nice for the price,4.0
The attention to detail on the painted finish is rather poor.  For that reason I cannot rate it a 5.,4.0
Good quality product.  Simple to put together and seems sturdy.,4.0
"Have purchased identical one a few months back...easy to put together except for the area that the handle bars meet the mounting location of the upright ""component.""",4.0
The bell on the handle was a big hit with the trike's new owner.  My only concern is thati It had a very strong rubber odor.  We let it air out for a couple of weeks but I could still smell it in the car.,4.0
Absolutely perfectly awesome!!!  Very low on quality for a radio flyer brand product compared to what i had as a kid unfortunately but it retains the cool factor and is a functioning tricycle that has been amazing for our kids! I've read some people complain about them tipping and to them i say stay in your bubble wrapped condo..,4.0
"Bought this at toys-r-us for $72 (with tax) my friend and I put it together, she missed a part and we had to take one of those red stopper things off. Which took forever. But we fixed it, as my daughter was riding the red thing fell off again.. She wasn't hurt either luckily. Where can I buy a new one?",4.0
All was good.,4.0
Good,4.0

Solid construction just like mine forty years ago!,4.0
It's cool and old school! Biut it's heavy for my 3 year old and the seat is too hard! He is not enjoying it so far,4.0
Got it for great grandson's birthday.  went together without any problems.  should last for several years.  It's like the ones i remember from when i was little.,4.0
Lave the trike because of sturdiness but it sqeaks like crazy no matter where you oil it.,4.0
"Good size for my just turned 4 year old who does not yet want to ride a bigger bicycle (pedals are placed in different position on other bikes, he doesn't do as well with those yet).  Wish the seat wasn't just hard metal and would like this not to rattle a bit.  Not sure where the rattle even comes from, but it is a bit creaky on a ride.  Wheels are ok on dirt surfaces but not as good as I was hoping for. They are not much better than our previous plastic ones, slipping and hard to find grip.  As others have mentioned, there is a smell - it is the rubber tires.  It seems to be going away after a few weeks now.  Only notice it when we enter the garage.  BTW, my own new bicycle has a similar smell.  Good because I do have the few complaints (creaky, metal seat, not great traction with the tires) but overall pretty good bike and a great size for my little guy.",4.0
My son loved it.,4.0
"strong beautiful trike, but i had to return it as the frame was out of line. a bushing was misplaced and cause trike to tilt. rode crooked. also the sprocket would not hold handle bars tight, kept turning regardless of how hard they was tightened. so sad to return it.  perfect for a 3 to 6 yr. old.  would buy again if i could get one that was perfect in all respects..",4.0
"One problem the packing was such a bad smell, don't know what it was Was sick for two days with that smell. I would really like to know what it was.",4.0
Ok,4.0
Only concrn I have is the on-going VERY strong odor of the rubber tires.,4.0
"Easy to build, everything lined up great. Nice paint and looks very cool. My grandchildren were impressed. My only issue was that the tires really reek of some odd smell. Hoping it goes away quickly. A word about safety. A lot has been written in the reviews here about that. Tricycles are inherently by design somewhat unsafe. They are meant to be used on a smooth surface at a moderate speed. If you used one as a kid then you know what I'm talking about.",4.0
OK good service and good toy.,4.0
nice trircle,4.0
"Nice tricycle, but definitely too big for a 2 year old.  My toddler is very big for his age, both height and weight, and he still cannot reach the pedals.  I think it will be probably another year before he can use this, so for now it is sitting in the garage.  I am sure he will love it once he can ride it.",4.0
Nice trike but too big even for a big 2 year old boy. Need a way to insert a training stick. Also even blocks didn't help him reach pedals. So we'll have to wait til he gets taller.,4.0
"As far as I know this bike is great, my sister hasn't complaind so it must be doing fantastic. It just like the one we had as kids and loved it.",4.0
"It was a good tricycle but was scratched when packed, hard to send back when a 2 year old opens the box and sees what is inside",4.0
This guy is soooo heavy. But it is very well built. easily this guy can outlast everyone in my family and still be around for audition lol. get it for your son. I think there a pink option around there too...,4.0
"Easy to put together and still the excellent quality expected from Radio Flyer. Had to put wooden blocks on the pedals so my granddaughter could reach the pedals, but, she loves it and that's what's important",4.0
"The tricycle was easy to assemble but the handle bars get out of alignment and needed adjustment often. I am not sure if it wasn't tightened enough when installed. The bell sound is very loud and my grandson likes to ring it even when he is not riding on it. My grandson is 3 years old and the lowest setting on the seat adjustment is the perfect height for him to reach the pedals. He will have plenty of time to grow into it. Overall, we are happy with the purchase since our grandson likes to ride it.",4.0
"Great bike, it exceeds my expectations.  It is sturdy and durable. My son will be 2 in March so he will be able to ride for several years,  also a collectors item.",4.0
"I bought a good tricycle for my granddaughter.  I really like Radio Flyer, I like the bells and whistles.  But for a first Tricycle, I would recommend just the one tier.  This is great quality though.",4.0
"Ordering was easy, shipping was fast, assembly was pretty straightforward with no difficulties.  Our son loves his tricycle, although his legs are just a tad too short to fully extend and push the pedals, but that was something we knew was likely prior to placing the order.  He will soon grow into it and this trike should last him a long time.  He also loves the bell and the tassels.",4.0
"Very authentic and a real tricycle made of metal not plastic! The only thing I would recommend is that a simple tool be inserted in packaging as we had to go out and buy a set of wrenches to get the handlebars tight enough and to adjust seat properly. Other than that, it is great. The bell is a definite bonus for a three year old.",4.0
Very good trike. Kids love riding on it. Very firm and sturdy. Only thing is very heavy but overall strong and trendy,4.0
Such a fun old-fashioned toy that children still love!  Just a touch disappointed in the detailing and how the handlebars tightened.  The bell makes a wonderful noise!  We will buy another one fairly soon for another grandchild.,4.0
"If you get the tricycle delivered you can easily assemble him in four steps with a clear drawing. The tricycle has solid rubber tires so he can also be used in the house. Nice bell that double tinkles. One disadvantage I find that he is quite large, it's nice (for a short time). The time they really cycling is relatively short because they can almost ride on an ordinary bike. The quality is just fine, some parts are just 1 x chrome plated so do not let it stand in the rain. If you have the rear axle out then put some fat on it else it will beeps when cycling.
Furthermore, it is simply a beautiful and fun sturdy tricycle that is well put together.
From The Netherlands :)",4.0
Our grandson seems to like it.  It works well and there were no problems.  I would recommend it to others,4.0
"Gotta love simplicity!  My 2 1/2 yr old (at 38""tall) just reaches the pedals and has started to move on his own.  Sure you have to assemble it, but it was fun to do it with my child's, ahem, ""help"".  This tricycle is great for boys & girls being red in color.  A bell & streamers? Bonus!",4.0
I purchased this tricycle for use as a photography prop only.  It is well made and the seat is height adjustable.  great price too.,4.0
The twins love them!  They are just like the tricycles around when I was a kid (except those were made in the USA).  I tried to find made in USA trikes and the only ones I found were by Dirt King (they were far too large for little kids and very expensive - guessing I am not their target market!),4.0
He loves his tricyle though he may be a tad bit too small for it as of now. But by the time summer comes around he should be riding like a pro!,4.0
Not too shabby- came w seat dented but not horrible. Overall the classic flyer- dual deck allows my 2.5 yr old to easily get on and off.,4.0
Classic looking trike for our 3 year old; he got on right away and pedaled through the house as soon as he got it. The only downside is getting the handlebars attached so that it turns the front wheel properly. Had to get worlds strongest man to tighten (worried that we were going to strip the bolt).,4.0
"bought this one over other because it has the rubber wheels, the other were plastic and doesn't go very well over gravel driveway.  This has steel frame and nice paint job.  The seat and handle bars are all adjustable for different proportions.  All in all, good product that I suspect will last even with my tornado of a son.",4.0
"my grandson loves this tricycle.  We sent to Italy and received when scheduled. It was his Christmas present, one he will carry with him all over Europe.",4.0
Tricycle arrived quickly and assembly was straightfoward with very clear and concise instructions. Typical sturdy Flyer construction. Our grandchild loved the gift and is riding it everywhere.,4.0
"I bought this Radio Flyer Tricycle for my 3-year-old grandson, and it is durable and sturdy.  I purchased it online because I saved a few dollars by doing so.  However, when I received the item in the mail, the packaging was torn and re-taped.  I think our local UPS delivery people are lax in their delivery methods.  The contents weren't damaged or missing, and I would purchase from Amazon again.",4.0
"I bought this tricycle for my 3 year old son.  It seems to be a well-made, quality item.  My son loves it, however the bell is too hard for him to ring on his own and if he turns the wheel to sharply, the trike will start to tip over.  I also have to agree with other reviews about the size of the trike versus the recommended age range.  My son is 3 and his legs are just barely long enough to pedal the bike.  We have the seat at the lowest setting and when he sits on it, he can only reach the floor with his tiptoes.  Granted, he is small for his age, but I don't see how a 2 year old child would be able to use this trike.",4.0
Am very happy I found this on line. Bought this for my 3 year old grandson. Reminds me of when my kids were young and had a bike just like this. Amazon is the best!,4.0
"My son is now three going on four and still rides his tricycle. This will be kept in our family for future generations to come.
Cons: I did note that the price went down after I bought it.",4.0
This trike is great but I have a tall two year old and it is too big for him. :(  This trike is made well and definitely will be fun for him when he grows a little more.,4.0
"Setting this tricycle up for Christmas for my two-year-old made me more aware of how sturdy this is: solid metal with very little plastic. One suggestion would be to add an additional tool to setting this up: a combination wrench. You can use an adjustable wrench, but I felt a combination wrench did the job quite well, where the suggested tools did not and were not able to complete the job...especially when tightening the bolts for securing the handle bar.

It is unfortunate that the chemical smells when I first opened the package was a huge turn-off. Not sure exactly was used to paint over the metal, but not sure if this is a good...the heavy chemical odors.",4.0
"Like all Radio Flyer products, this was easy to assemble thanks to their wonderful engineering of the product, and it is rock solid durable!  The assembly took no more than 15 minutes, and we will adjust the seat and the handlebars when our son tries it out the first time.",4.0
"Arrived in perfect condition. Some assembly required. Tools not provided, but I had the tools.
My daughter is only 3 and is just learning how to ride a tricycle, so this was a perfect gift for her.
She was very excited once she saw that she now had her own form of transportation.
It's very sturdy and easily put together with simple instructions.
Well worth it if you have a young one.",4.0
"Like others, we have a sqeaky front wheel, though not so loud that really bothers you -- especially if you are outside. also, the lose handlebars -- the deal there is that when you put the thing together, you've got to tighten them BEYOND what seems necessary. Get someone stronger than you to help with this if necessary.

Beyond that, I'm lovin' this bike. Solid construction with real METAL parts means no cracking. Real rubber wheels means the bike gets good traction. The back step serves as a mount and as a means to give other small kids a piggy-back ride.

Yes, the center of gravity is higher than with modern styles of trikes. But if your kid is going to learn to ride a bike in  a few years, she needs to understand the concept of balance beforehand. Riding a trike that requires a tiny sense of balance helps you toward that goal. It's not like the thing tips over every time she gets up to 4 mph. Take advantage of the opportunity to teach her how to take turns at the proper speed and angle and she'll be fine. Remeber, although a large or very athletic 2-year-old could use this bike, it's really made for age 3 and 4, as far as I can tell.",4.0
"My daughter, 3, loves this bike. The handle bars need a bit more tightening though.",4.0
"This trike is great, we have two toddlers, one 3 years of age, one 5 years of age, both just getting into biking, and wearing a helmet.  The bike is well made, and all the parts came with it, I did however, have trouble with the handle bar adjustment, and one tire was slightly bent but I took it to my local bike shop and it was a quick fix for $15 for both bikes, no big deal. The bike shop actually commented on how well made the bike was, and even thinking of selling them.  the only drawback is the seat, it does drop to a lowest setting but my toddlers still have issues with reaching the pedals, I would say they will more than likely ""grow into these bikes"" for the next few years. Our 5 year old though is special needs and he was able to use the bike by sitting on it, and pushing with his feet.  Overall, a great bike, a great find, speedy delivery, outstanding customer service, and no issues.  Highly recommend it!",4.0
Gave this to my grandson for his 2nd Birthday. He and his friend enjoyed it. the extra step helps them get on board. It can be tipped if one is on it and the other pulls on the handelbars.,4.0
I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter. She loves it and doesn't want to leave it. It is very helpful for learning balance and a good transition to a two wheel bike. I also bought a helmet.,4.0
"We bought this tricycle for our almost 4 year old son, who is constantly falling over with a bicycle with training wheels. He is fairly tall and still uses the seat in the lower position. The Shanghai name propably does not mean anything since it is really just the same as the ordinary classic red bike. Some reviews of the classic bike mention instability and falling over. We have not noticed this at all. Of course our boy does his best to be as wild as possible with the thing and so he can tip over, but so far he has been able to stop himself from falling with his feet. A difference with the really old versions of this bike (my father still has one) is that the handle bars do not turn all the way left and right (there is a limit build in) and with that make the bike much more stable.",4.0
"Got this for my 3 year old's birthday and he was excited.  Had a strange, strong smell out of the box but it lives in the garage now, so I guess that doesn't matter.  The trike fits him well, though any sooner and he wouldn't have been big enough.  Little brother already tries to climb on the back step...will be  nice feature in the future.  I make him wear a helmet because it can tip if turned too sharply.  The trike squeaks a lot too, but it  may have to do with my assembly skills.  Overall, I'm still glad I bought it.  He can pedal forward and backwards and loves the bell.  Between this and his glider bike, hopefully by his next birthday he'll be ready for a two wheel bicycle!",4.0
Ordered this bike on Amazon and it arrived 24 hours later. Love the classic styling and the durable build and it was fairly simple to assemble. The seat is solid metal so perhaps a cushioned seat would be better. My son is 26-months-old and he loves it already. Only problem is that he can't reach the pedals (and he's tall for his age). Other reviewers have had the same problem so when my son is taller I'm sure he'll love it even more. Also agree with other reviewers about the bike being top-heavy and prone to tipping over but that's typical for an old-style tricycle. In the meantime I'll have to buy him a bike that he can actually use.,4.0
Durable bike and the only disappointment was it didn't come with the bell that's shown.  I had to go buy one and put on it and the little ones love the bell.,4.0
"He's happy to have a trike that fits him.  And his little brother is happy to take over the one left behind.  The instructions were simple, but you do have to follow them as my husband, who never follows instructions, will attest.  The bell was faulty, but my call to the manufacturer was answered politely and enthusiastically.  We'll see if the bell shows up but I'm optimistic.",4.0
"We bought this for my husband's Godson,who will be two. He could not come close to touching the pedals, but we will find the blocks that attach to the pedals to make them thicker. That should work. He fell in love with it right away, and wouldn't get off. The bell would not stay together no matter what, so it will have to be replaced with another one. All-in-all, it is completely sturdy, and he is going to get tons of play time out of it. Aside from a bell that can easily be replaced, I would definitely recommend it.",4.0
"We bought this for our son and when my husband came home from the store with it I was hesitant since I had read these online reviews about height concerns.  Our son is 2 yrs 4 mos and in the 25th percentile for height.  We were thrilled when he got on it the first time and was immediately able to ride it.  The adjustable seat was a good thing as we have it as low as possible.  He is super confident on it and loves the 'steps' to climb up onto the seat.  Due to the reviews about toppling over, that is my only concern (yet to happen but am sure some day it will!!)",4.0
"We bought this bike for our two-year-old.  She loves playing on it and it's fairly easy for her to ride.  The bell that comes with it was broken when we got it, so that was a little disappointing, but we figure we can just buy another bell somewhere else.  It wasn't worth sending it back.  It seems fairly sturdy and took about 30 minutes to put together.  It will probably last a long time.",4.0
"My husband and I purchased this bike for our son when he was about 2 1/2.  His feet barely reached the pedals, so we helped him until he got big enough.  Now he's 3, his feet reach the pedals, and every couple of days we go for a walk, and he rides his tricycle.  He is not a fast kid, so he stays right next to us, and occasionally he does start to tip over, but we usually catch him in time to keep him from getting hurt.  He climbs right back on and we go again.  We bought a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads at the same time that we purchased this tricycle, and he wears them EVERY TIME.  He is also always within reach when he's on the tricycle.

I have read many one star reviews, and I would agree with them that your child has to be just the right size to ride the bike--perhaps being taller and heavier makes it harder to stay upright, thanks to inertia and wind resistance.  I can also see that if your child is more physically inclined and likes to go fast, this would not be the tricycle for you--it's more like a cadillac than a mustang.  However, it's been a good, safe tricycle for my son, and has provided him with hours of learning and fun.

One mechanical issue is the bell: the screws have loosened and it hangs beneath the handlebars.  This could be more an indicator of my husband's procrastination than anything else, though.",4.0
"We have had this trike for 4 years, so I've seen it put through the paces. Here are it's pros and cons.

Pros: Great looking, charming, classic metal trike. There is something touching about seeing your child on a classic red tricycle. Also, the back shelves are fun (but not all that safe!) for another kid or two to stand on. Plus, bigger kids can actually sit on the top shelf and pedal it that way. With a rope, the trike can be easily (though again maybe not safely) used to tow a wagon.

Cons: The first con is that it really is way too big for a 20 month old. From the seat to the pedal is just over 16 inches. The seat to the ground is 15 inches. To be comfy, a child will need inseam at least that long. In general, the trike seems to fit average size 4 year olds best. Even if it does fit your child, it tips over very easily when kids turn it. Over time, my kids learned just how sharp a turn they could safely make. Note also that there are no brakes--so it's not at all safe on a road or even a hill. Lastly, after 4 years it's in very bad shape. The tires are all warped and wobbly, the front tire comes off occasionally (though the kids love putting it back on)and the streamers have long ago fallen out of the handlebars.

In sum, this toy has provided my family with years on mild entertainment, mostly because they like to tow the wagon, but it's not heirloom quality. I probably would buy it again, but I am glad we had other bike-toys around to go with it. If you are only buying one bike, consider some other options. Specifically, if your child is 1 or 2, think about first getting a sit-on toy that they push with their feet, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Radio-Flyer-Rolling-Pony/dp/B00004TXM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Radio Flyer Rolling Pony</a>. If they are older (3 or 4, depending on the kid), consider buying them a tiny bike with training wheels.",4.0
"The Radio Flyer Classic Red 12 Tricycle is a great retro toy that turns heads. However, I would not recommend it to children under 20 month old, because reaching the pedals it's very difficult. It's quite hard for them to keep balance even if they do reach the pedals. After having it for few months, I think I already need to put UB40 oil, because I hear squeeks while wheels keep turning. It's all metal which makes it strong, but it does require maintenance. Fun tricycle. My daughter enjoys playing with the rubber hair that sticks out of the stearing wheel.",4.0
"We bought this tricycle for christmas for our 2.5 year old son. He is very tall for his age, this trike gives him some room to grow. I love how the bike looks, with the streamers, he loves the bell!

The only negetive thing I could say is it does seems to tip over easily, I think my son does it on purpose... he loves to crash!

I had a radioflyer tricycle when I was his age, I am sure it was my brothers before it was mine. These trikes last forever. I am very happy with the purchase. It is a great value, and a classic tricycle.",4.0

Just be sure that you choose the one that is appropriate to your child's age and stature.",4.0
"This was a birthday present for my two year old. She was a little short to push the peddles all the way at first, but quickly grew into it.

But my husband put it together for his second birthday, with some minor difficulties with the handle bar, and we discovered he won't be riding it until he's about 5! He is short and there's no way he can adapt to the height of this trike. Definitely have your child test drive it first.",4.0
"I wanted to get my son the tricycle all little children should have, so I bought this one.  I was disappointed in the quality.  He loves riding it, but it has not held up very well to the 3 times per week that he rides it.  He's had it for less than a year now.  If you plan on keeping it for a while, or passing it down to another sibling, look for another, better quality product.",4.0
"This is not only a nostalgic cute ""toy"" for my generation but it is also a well-disguised tool to learn balance and control before moving onto a real bicycle for my three year-old son. It may not be the preschool plastic low-riding bike that never tips over or doesn't hurt as much when he takes a spill but it certainly reminds him that everything needs to be approached with a certain amount of knowledge, understanding and respect. Personally, I feel no toy should be played with without any parental supervision at first...it's my job as a parent and a guide to show my child the ""correct"" way to tackle things and then to have him challenge that and then settle on his own way. I have shown him what to do and what not to do in order to manipulate the tricycle. It's a learning experience for him to remember that he shouldn't turn the wheel fast or too extreme in order to avoid falling off. It's a firm tricycle and it feels more like a grown-up ""thing"" than a kid's ""thing""--he likes that.
And the bell--he really likes that...you should see the proud smile on his face.",4.0
"UPDATE AUGUST 2006: It has been nearly five years since I bought this trike and wrote the below review. The trike is still holding its own. It was handed down to my second child, who outgrew it, and then handed down to our neighbor, who is still riding it.
__________________________________________________________

Yes, this is the classic trike, virtually unchanged from its original design. Unfortunately, that also means that the design has not substantially improved during the past 40 years. I got this for my 3-year old, and she began riding it with a little effort. Now she's 4, and she still loves riding it. No problem there.

One problem is that the child sits high on the trike, and the front wheel is small enough and thin enough that it is easy for the child to tip over when making a quick turn. This is especially true when turning at a sidewalk corner that that has been modified to slope toward the street for wheelchair access.

Another problem is that the handlebars can become misaligned with the wheel (wheel is straight, but handlebars are turned a smidge to one side, and vice versa)unless you screw the bolt in real REAL tight. Same with the seat; because it's held in place by a bolt, the seat can become misaligned by swiveling a fraction of an inch in either direction unless its screwed in really REALLY tight.

The best part about this trike is the bell. It has one of the best bike/trike bells I've ever heard. The second best part of this trike is that it is one of the few these days that have the back platform for another kit to stand on. Yes, I have a feeling that modern trikes eliminate this feature for safety reasons, but I am one of those who think ""safety concerns"" have gone a little too far. Riding on the back is king.

Even with the above concerns, I love this trike. It just means that you gotta watch the really young ones when they're riding around. My 18-month old son now wants to play with it. He climbs on and pretends to ride, ringing the bell. (For him, this year, I got him the ""Rock, Roll and Ride Trike"" by Fisher Price. It's a rocker, then a push-trike, then a full-blown trike.)

(...)",4.0
"We gave this trike to our son for his second birthday and he loves it.
The pedals are a bit far for his feet to reach, so my husband cut some wood to fit and taped the wood to the pedals.  Daniel likes the bell and the tassles on the handlebars, too.  It's such a good-looking bike and will probably last forever.
Daniel is still learning how to pedal it himself; we didn't expect him to know how to do it immediately.  We also purchased a helmet for him and thankfully, he likes wearing it.",4.0
"Just in time for the grandson's visit.  It says ""indoor"" - but we've got a hoop just right for his height out on the patio, and it's working just fine outside as well.  Well-made, good bounce, just the right size.",4.0

"This is a nice indoor basketball for men. I get a good grip, it feels good and it has a nice bounce that is consistent. If you are in an indoor gym, this is great ball for you. It is an intermediate 28.5 inches in circumference and it inflates to 6 to 8 pounds. The outside has the Baden cushion control technology, which gives you that good grip and that feels softer than other balls. A pro ball that is 29.5 inches is also available in the Element series.",4.0
Baden makes some really nice basketballs. The Element is not quite as nice as the Elite but it is still a premium ball. It has both good grip and a nice bounce. It arrives almost fully inflated but make sure you top it off before you hit the gym to get maximum play from it.,4.0
Good ball but you should buy the Elite instead.,4.0
"The SOG Power Lock is the best of the multitool world!  Smooth action, excellent quality, sturdy design.  Some don't like the covers, some do, but if you use them they give you a second lock for your tools. Very strong.  Nice thing is that you can remove the covers if you want - your option. With that said, SOG is the ONLY multitool that you can personally customize and buy extra parts for. So if you want to make your tool ""multi-mission"" and change some of the tools out for others, you can. ALL others brands will not sell you their parts - you have to return them to the maker for repair. This is a HUGE plus. The SOG is easy to take apart and clean using normal 1/4 inch nutdrivers - no special security screwdrive tips! Only downside to the SOG is the size and weight. Yes, it's bigger than most tools and it's heavier in comparsion, but if you really want one tool to count on, instead of a tool box full of tools - the SOG is the one. My Leatherman Wave is going in the drawer, get the SOG - you won't be sorry :)",4.0
"I purchased this tool on the brand alone. Sog makes great kit and this was a welcome addition to mine.

Its bigger than my leatherman with a better set of pliers. When closed, the teeth on the pliers fit together so well you could use it like a pair of tweezers. The power grip works. Know your own strength and don't use this on plastic parts or markable surfaces.

My leatherman was a disappointing in the blade department. This tool is razor sharp, but the blade was thinner than expected. Don't expect to be prying anything open with this blade. (Not that you should anyway)

SOG didn't skimp on the case either. No flimsy nylon case here. This tool comes with a heavy(1/8 inch thick) treated leather case.

If you were worried about getting what you paid for, worry not, this is a great tool and well worth the money.",4.0
"This is an excellent large multitool.  I own seven of them (Gerber Legend, Leatherman Wave and Juice XE6, custom Gerber 600, Shrade Tough Tool and Bucktool) and this is the largest.
With the compound leverage on this size tool it has outstanding gripping power.  The handle covers make this a great feeling tool with none of the pain one might feel while clamping down on a traditional Leatherman.
All of the tools lock well with the exception that the drive socket and bottle opener can come loose.  This is the only reason I gave this tool four stars and I am not sure that it is not particular to just my tool.  If someone wants a large tool with the best gripping ability than this is the one to get.  This tool also has a great price for the size.",4.0
"I bought this as a Secret Santa gift, and the recipient was very pleased.  his multi-toolhas good heft, is well made, and has a good assortment of tools/blades. Add to that the great price, and I was pleased to be able to give this as a gift.",4.0
"Well, it's SOG, so it's Lifetime Guarantee on the main tool (not on the blades, though). My wonderful Paladin PT-525 finally broke at the jaw when I torqued it hard in the wrong direction. Turns out that SOG was partners with Paladin and made that tool, so they're fixing that for free.

But I bought a second one for my son, as it's so useful and well made.

Took off one star because they no longer make those specialty blades that came on my Paladin, and set it apart from everybody else's multi-tool. They don't make the Telephone/Data blades anymore, and that was a BIG plus for me.

Hey, SOG - you listening? Make more blades available  - you'll be a favorite of each industry that you do that for!",4.0
Smooth opening but sometimes the tools stick to the knife and scissors.  I'm going to try adding some oil but I'm hoping it is just due to the fact that it needs worn in.  I was cautious of the sheath at first since it just slides over the belt but it stays on very well and actually requires a decent amount of effort when taking the holster off at night.  It has proven to be a trusty and reliable tool so far.,4.0
"I bought mine at Lowe's so I have the V-Cutter and a leather Sheath. But the one I bought off here came with Scissors and a cloth sheath.

My review will be mostly about mine with splashes of the other one in.

Pro's
 - Affordable
 - Sturdy (so far)
 - Guards make it more comfortable to hold (though they are removable if you don't like them.
 - The Power lock is nice
 - 1/4 Drive (which could be helpful in a pinch)
 - Full size so you won't really feel like you will break it easily
 - Electrical Crimpers (I am a tinkerer and sometimes I'm lazy so these work well when I don't want to grab my actual crimpers.
Con's
 - I don't like the Serrated/straight combo knife (I just don't care for them on the whole)
 - Saw seems a little flimsy (But I haven't tried it yet so don't take my word for it look at other reviews for better saw info)
 - Leather case is crap. The leather is nice quality IMO but it has a plastic clasp and enough head room for it to slip out on the job. (Easily fixed by taking it off and moving it down a little the it becomes very nice)
 - The other case that this one came with has a pocket clip style belt loop but the case is tighter fitting.(My brother almost lost it on his way for a ride in a B-17 today no joke so be careful but he wasn't wearing it on a belt.)

So all in all it's a nice multi-tool to have for the price...but if you don't want to muck with the sheath you can just get a better one.",4.0
"the sog multi-tool is one of the best pliers out there. I have been a leatherman user since their beginning and since have owned almost all of the multi tool brands if not held and used or tried all. the plier heads open all the way up wide until the handles are out vertically. I have owned my sog that I purchased from lowes for over a year This multi tool I purchased for my father for fathers day 2013. he has owned and used leatherman from the beginning and nothing else. warning to some one else switching multi tool brands , there is a learning curve to owning these and you will find out your own likes and dislikes about these comparing to your other brand. if you go on  sogs website they individually sell each tool so you can customize your multi tool to your liking .The compound leverage as other reviewers have stated is very strong and allows you to use the plier heads for many strong task. the tool are ok some could definitely use some more strength but for replacement just order some from sog. The sheath is ok but you can replace one with a sheath from triple k leather they are superb and will last a lifetime , but they are $ 20. well worth it though. this pair of sog M.T. has a cover for the compound leverage and compared to my pair from lowes is night and day. so much that I am sending my multi-tool back to sog to be switched over.",4.0
"This multitool is quite well made imo.  One important feature for me in a multitool is the pliers, and these are quite good.  As has been stated, the compound leverage give excellent gripping force.  The wire cutters are great.  My first test was to cut a coat/shirt hanger, that was done quite easily.
I read complaints about multiple tools coming out when you pull one out, that's true.  They do.  The smaller tools are also a bit difficult to get out.  I have to use both hands to get any of them out... I don't know how you could do it with just one hand.  I like the tool covers as well, they work quite nicely to eliminate the pain of really cranking down with the pliers that you might experience with other multitools.
Please note, the complaints about the tools and the locking mechanism... very true.  When you pull out a tool, make sure every other tool is closed back in just right and then make sure your tool is locked. It's very easy to pull out the knife, push the other tools back, and forget to make sure the knife is then locked.  The ""piano style"" lock SnakeStrike77 mentions in his review, and as seen in the pictures would be very nice, but they don't exist on this model.  The single plate as seen in the video does.
David Chesterman says the drive socket and bottle opener can come loose... that's no more true than for any other tool.  And the drive socket can actually lock in 2 positions, fully extended (like all the tools) and half extended (sticking out sideways)... though you can't close the tool if it's out sideways as it will hit the other handle
Just a note on the case: initially I thought with the clip it may not stay on my belt all too well, I've had problems with those plastic clips just being too flimsy or something.  Not so... It stays quite well and is strong; and the bottom of the clip has a hook-like end and catches very well. I'm quite pleased with it also.
Overall, good quality product.
Rated 4 stars for 3 reasons...
1. The 'less-than-perfect' locking mechanism
2. ""Clumpiness"" of tools and difficulty pulling out just the smaller tools (common annoyance).
3. And an issue I had with one of the tool covers.  It would come off VERY easily, not good.  I think I've fixed it though with a bit of use of the pliers to tweak the angle of the cover.",4.0
"I generally carry a multi-tool when I'm carrying a backpack.  It lets me have access to a lot of small tools in a compact package.  I like the SOG for the ratcheting plier mechanism (more leverage) and the tool quality, plus the ease of replacing individual tools.  The SOG also doesn't have edges on the grip that bite into your hands and it doesn't have plastic parts that can crack or soften when exposed to chemicals and the outdoors. I picked the SOG specifically because it appeared more substantial and rugged than other tools.

Of course, there are lots of other manufacturers making tools that in many cases are just as nice, so pick one that meets your needs.  I broke the knife blade off so that it doesn't attract unwanted attention going through metal scanners.  You probably can't take this on a plane even without the knife blade.",4.0
Good knife for the money.  Lightweight and slim.  More movement in the hinge than Gerber or Benchmade. But good every day carry knife.,4.0
"This purchase was a replacement of a Pentagon Elite I, had carried for over a decade, then gifted to a former girlfriend. The blade is made with VG-10 steel that has proved to hold its edge well and the times that it needed to be resharpened it took the edge easily. The pocket clip is good, but will get caught on things, and will eventually be bent. I, removed mine and carried it in my front pocket.

The new Pentagon is the same as my original, and proved just as sharp, durable, and has been put into my EDC rotation. The main use that I, have for this knife is striking fear in the hearts of my enemies with my ninja skills, and spreading peanut butter on my bread.

The photo shows the Pentagon, next to a Spec Elite I. I, highly recommend this knife.

"Ok, I'm a recreational knife collector.  I carry a pair of Zero Tolerance 0566's daily.  I prefer frame locks over other lock types for most folders.  I consider a $90-$110 range to be ""mid-grade"" blades and this fits that category.  I like the Arc Lock that is similar to the Benchmade Axis, making it easy to wing this knife open (and closed) instantly with one hand, flick of the wrist.

The VG-10 Steel is a good mix of edge retention, corrosion resistance, and ability to sharpen.  This knife is made in Seki City, Japan which like Solingen, Germany; has a history of quality blade production.  I'm planning on picking up the larger Pentagon Elite II next, as soon as I catch my financial breath after all of the Holiday purchases.  This knife is not small by any means and its 4"" blade may not be legal in your area.

I probably would have given this knife a 5 star rating but the lock up while fast, and easy to operate, was not as solid as I would prefer and the knife I received has a very slight amount of vertical play.  Not enough to warrant returning, but enough to knock a star off when compared to a similar priced Benchmade Griptilian or Gerber Downrange.  In fairness, this knife retails for about $20-$30 less than the aforementioned folders and I think can hold its own against similar knives.  I do prefer the heft and palm feel of the Gerber Applegate Fairbairn Covert and Combat Folders over this SOG, however they are not quite as fast.  If you like a folder that feels like a a fixed blade, get the Gerber (not the mini-Covert). If you like a lighter dagger profile, you will love this knife.",4.0
Great knife!  Takes a good edge and holds it nicely.  The SOG sharpener works okay also but leaves a bur on the edge so i recommend using a diamond stone or ceramic sticks to put finishing touches on it.,4.0
"I CARRY THIS EVERY DAY SEKI JAPAN STEEL, AWESOME BLADE CAN RE SHARPEN INFINITELY  WISH THEY WOULD MAKE ONE WITH A METAL SIDE AS OPPOSED TO ABS PLASTIC.",4.0
"This is what I carry everyday at work onboard ships, it is a great knife and I've had one since year 2000 back when they were liner locks... that one got stollen while I was at sea.  These newer models with the ARC lock are fantastic.  That locking system is right up there with Benchmade's Axis system.  VG10 steel for these blades is also very good - although I do hate the bead blasted finish, it isn't rust proof so do keep up with a small amount of maintenance on your knife.  The tip is great for piercing and I find the combo edge handy - all in all a great knife, my only gripe would be as a civilian I wouldn't EDC this outside of work, it is a 4"" blade (large side for edc) and a little bulky - my kershaw skyline fits the ddc role better.",4.0
"All in, this is a very good knife.  High quality steel, holds the edge well, lightning fast (yet still legal) opening mechanism.  For the price, this was an excellent purchase, in my opinion, and I highly recommend it.  However, after carrying the knife for a couple of weeks, though, here are a couple of minor hangups:

1. blade - the blade is covered in a matte finish which makes it less than mirror-bright.  This is intentional, and a welcome feature.  The problem is that matte finish is just that - a finish.  it will get scratched off a bit due to interactions with other materials, foreign objects getting collected inside the knife's body, etc.

2. size - the description reads 4 inches (SOG makes a 5 inch version as well).  However, blade length is typically counted along the entire cutting surface, and since the back of the blade is also sharpened (for about 1/4 of an inch or so), it just may be an issue for an overzealous rule enforcer in your state, as the cutting length is technically above 4 inches.

3. hole in the back - the fact that the knife is ambi means that the clip is reversible.  Whichever side it is on, the opposite side has a big ""mounting hole"" for the clip.  It would be great if later iterations of the knife came with some sort of a ""plug"" that could get screwed into the hole that's not occupied by the clip.

4. thickness - the back side of the hilt is thicker than the front.  Not sure if there's a structural reason for it, but combined with the knife's already significant width, it makes it less of a comfortable pocket carry.

5. texture - the handle is made of hard plastic that SOG uses on may of their knives.  while i have no reason to doubt its durability, the surface is rough and not exactly easy on the hands.  I suppose it's intentional and needed to retain the grip, but I don't know if there was an easier way to achieve that without making the knife feel like sandpaper on your skin.

with that in mind, i want to reiterate that i still like this knife a lot over much of the competition.",4.0
"Double bladed, my only gripe is the blade's a tad short. Most manufacturers of great knives don't want to go through the trouble sharpening both edges, but SOG. The characteristics of this knife make it a good fighting knife, but a little on the smallish side. Take a look at the Cold Steel Voyager with a 5- or 6-inch blade for not a whole lot more money. Chances are you'll drop this one in a heartbeat.

Free shipping on knives would be great, too, but too many of these outfits want $7 or $8 to send you a $45 knife! I keep hoping free shipping will become the wave of the future in Internet sales. At least on smaller items.",4.0
"As a weekend warrior and avid outdoor individual I neede an all around knife. Not to small, not to big. This knife takes care of that. It has a great blade, is easy to open, and easy to sharpen. The major drawback is the aesthitics, it could be a little more polished, and a little smoother in design.",4.0
Works great in my EDC bag. The only thing I don't like is the pliers can fold if your not careful when your using it.,4.0
"I have owned this multi tool for years. And while I love it, I can not say that I'm IN love with it. The pros for this tool are the Allen assembly that allows you to swap out tools, and completely disassemble the tool for cleaning. The plier heads can be angled to get into tight spaces. The overall design is ultra sleek, and lightweight.

The cons I found with this multi tool were odd, didn't affect it's daily use, and with care (and in my case brains :P) could easily be overcome. The tools don't actually 'lock' into place, when they fold out they seem to be held just by compression. This is fine for most uses but just be careful not to go trying to break a stubborn bolt loose, or you will ruin your knuckles. When using the pliers, think carefully about where you want your hands to go when the head folds up or down unexpectedly. I have used the angle headed feature maybe a handful of times, always just to grab something that fell, never to try and loosen something with it. I was slightly disappointed with the number of tools available from SOG to swap out. Sure a seatbelt cutter is awesome, but I feel that they really could use this design as a skunk works to test new concepts in what a multi tool could be. swap out all 5 tools on one side for a spring loaded window punch? Why not? Instead of pliers, have a RG45 crimper? Crazier things have been tried, and who knows maybe it changes the world of multi tool forever.

All in all, I would recommend the Paratool for anyone who needs a smaller, lightweight tool for tightening the occasional screw. And cracking the occasional beer. For something that is a little easier to open one handed, check out a gerber. But for a utilitarian tough as nails multi tool that you can break down to your zany little fixer hearts content, look no further.",4.0

"I bought this kit at a yard sale for a $1, and luckily when my daughter and I went to assemble it, all of the pieces were there!  Apparently the previous owner hadn't read the directions - they had tried to put everything together using clear scotch tape and then gave up halfway through.  It clearly says to use cement!  I bought some at Walmart for $1.58 or some such nonsense.

So far my 11-year old and I have spent an hour on assembly - and we've gotten the legs, the skull and part of the rib cage glued down to the spine - we're taking it slow because we want to make sure the cement is really dry.  Later on today we're going to do more.  We're going to buy the paint to do the organs tomorrow.

It's been fun and educational so far.  Neither of us have built a model, much less one that we've had to rip tape off of to correct some errors made my the previous owners, but we've enjoyed it.",4.0
"At the time I bought this model I was in an equine reproduction course and thought it would be fun to immerse myself in all things equid (I'm pre-vet and a biology nerd). I enjoyed putting this model together. Sure, at times it was a pain to keep the pieces together long enough for the model glue to dry, but it allowed time for innovation as I found all sorts of common objects to use as vices.

Currently it sits on my dresser. I didn't completely finish it because I really only intended to complete the skeleton. Someday I may finish assembly and put the organs in, but not any day soon. I rather enjoy the way the skeleton looks in the transparent plastic ""horse"" case. If not an educational piece it sure acts as a conservation piece. If done with patience and done properly following the directions (having an outside image of the internal anatomy can help if the little number tags fall off)you can end up with an interesting trinket.

I call it ""My Little Death Pony."" My friends love it. Also, it is quite large in comparison to some of the other animal/human model kits I've seen. Now I really want the Visible Cow and a human model to complete the collection.",4.0
"This is a fun project.  My horse only came with half a heart (parts missing), so that was annoying.",4.0
"I think people might be misled by the previous reviewer's comments about the Visible Horse, which neglected to mention a few important facts:  The box and instructions both clearly state that the paints and modeling cement are sold separately.

The reason the organs are ""putty colored"" is because they're unpainted.  You are expected to paint them yourself, which is part of the fun (and the point) of putting a model kit together.  I wouldn't buy a paint-by-numbers kit and then be disappointed that it didn't come already painted, for instance.

The reason the model didn't fit together is because you didn't use the modeling cement, which is necessary for this.  Household glue simply won't work.  Fortunately the cement is very cheap.  (I got mine for about a buck at the nearest craft store.)  I have found that with the modeling cement, the Visible Horse fits together very well and with no problems.

It's been a lot of fun painting the organs and assembling the skeleton.  We had an interesting discussion about what color to paint the spleen, and we were both amazed at how huge a horse's heart is compared to his brain.  This is exactly the sort of interactive and educational fun I was hoping the model would provide; it sure beats looking at an anatomy chart.

My only complaint with the Visible Horse is that the paint and the cement are sold separately (it would've been more convenient if they'd been included), and the instructions are bare bones:  How to put the model together, and that's it.  Information about the organs and skeleton and how they work would've been a nice touch.

"This tricycle has been great, very durable. It was given to my daughter when she was 3 and then my son.  They haven't had any issues with the weight, until recently. As long as the tires are pumped up, they can go very fast.  They could go up hill pretty good, had to build leg strength.

Warning **, son was riding trike with daughter on back pushing.  My son's shoe lace got caught and pulled his foot all the way around in a circle. Breaking his tibia and fibia.  Son's shoes were too tight to pull off and shoe lace tighten with the pull. His foot was stuck and I couldn't get it off quickly.  Seemed like they were having such a great time until the bottom of his foot ended up facing him wrapped around the peddle. What a nightmare for all of us, terrible pain and long trip to emergency room and surgery.

If you use this, use velcro shoes, and/or don't go to fast like going down hills or be pushed to hard from the back.  Otherwise this has been a great toy.  Both kids didn't really want to learn how to ride a bike they love this so much.",4.0
"The John Deere Mighty trike is a hefty and solid piece of kit. We ordered it from the U.S.A, and it quickly arrived in scotland. We needed a trike that could handle our rural setting - and this trike does the job. One pedal crank had slightly damaged chrome. The headstock bolt when tight still allows a little handlebar play. The rear wheel split pins are too large to allow a flush hubcap fit. However - these are minor issues, and I would buy it again. It looks great, and is built to last. My son loves it. I wish I was 3 again....",4.0
The Mighty Trike is very well built and quite durable.  You will need to put air in the tires as soon as you put it together.  Putting it together is quite easy.  My only complaint is that the handlebars will not stay in the upright position.  I took the trike to a bicycle shop and they put air in the tires but even they couldn't get the handlebars to stay in the upright position no matter how they tighten the handle bars.  I will address the vendor on Monday for their suggestions.  My 3 year loves the trike.  I will feel more comfortable when the handle bar issue is corrected.  I would have rated this trike a 5 if it weren't for the handle bar issue.,4.0
"I purchased the John Deere-Mighty Trike as a replacement tricycle for my 3 year old granddaughter.  Upon arrival, the two of us assembled the Mighty Trike.

Problem No. 2 - The handlebar design, although strong, needs an additional pin or screw to keep the handlebar upright as pictured.  I drilled an additional hole above the assembly bolt and installed a No. 8 machine screw and elastic stop-nut.  Now our Mighty Trike lives up to its name and is built like a rock.",4.0
"This will be a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old son.  I cannot really rate it yet, but I'm sure he will absolutely love it.",4.0
"My 3 year old received this for his birthday in August.  He loves it!!!  My husband and I liked it more at the beginning but each time a peddle falls off, we get a little bit more aggravated with it.  We have had to put the peddles back on this bike at least 10 times in 2 1/2 months.  It would be more enjoyable if it was made a little bit better.",4.0
When I got the knife it is exactly what I thought it would be.  It is nice and small to carry around but not too small to be unusable. Blade opens easily and is very sharp.,4.0
This stuff seems a little expensive but make a bad job easier. We used 2 bottles to do our 6 chairs and table.,4.0
"Purchased this to refresh some teak patio furniture. I think it works better on a smaller area than we had to clean up. If you're trying to do a large table and six chairs (which had smaller slats), I'm not sure it's worth all the time and effort required. It's not like ours was that bad-certainly not to the 'grey stage', but more like the surface had gotten weathered and dirty-looking. In hindsight, I think using a power sander on the surface would have been much easier and less expensive. I gave it 4 stars because I think it definitely works well for some things, just not for our project.",4.0
Works great,4.0

"I'd previously used Star Brite's teak oil when I originally bought my new patio set 3 years ago, and it's time for a thorough cleaning, so I decided to try their teak cleaner.  This product plus an inexpensive nylon bristle brush did a pretty good job removing the accumulated grime on my table and chairs, and they're now ready for another teak oil application.

"I bought this gizmo for my husband as a motivational tool, since all my low-tech approaches of excercise incentives had failed. He loves it and has made great progress in planning a more active daily schedule. The sportbrain is very easy to install and register. The cradle gets hooked up to the phone-line and you register your monitor via the free website. Then you clip it on and it starts recording every single step you take. At the end of the day you pop it into the cradle and it transmits your activity data to the website. The next time you log on, there is your updated ""sportivity"" profile. The website is free and well-designed, you have access to all kinds of graphs and information that help you keep track of your fitness level. After the success of our first sportbrain, my husband got a second monitor for me, it works with the same cradle. I have been using it daily and it works really well. My only complaint is that popping the monitor into the cradle takes a little bit of practice at first - not the greatest of all designs.",4.0
"THis was failry easy and quickd to put together.
It is very lightweight, so easy to move around.
Not overly huge, so could be small for older kids to play soccer with.
Perfect size for street hockey, which was our intended purchase.

I am giving 4 stars because I ama bit worried about how durable it will be with boys rough housing.
Mine will regularly be use with a decent sized group of boys aged 9-11 for roller street hockey.
It is basically PVC pipes with a net, looks great with the sleeves/",4.0
"Purchased 2 for my 11 year old who pulls them to the park and back every day.. The nets have held up pretty well but the center pole has become loose and the poles fall off occasionally. Over all good product for the cost compared to others out there. **suggestion**.. put some pvc glue on joints when you assemble, if you have the room to store them it helps.",4.0
"I now own 2 of these goals.  I bought first 2 years ago and needed a second and went with the same product.  The one that I have from 2 years ago is sun faded but the netting and pipes are in great shape.  The ability to fold it up and hang it on the garage wall is a GREAT thing.  Being it is made of PVC pipe it is light weight.  Pulling the joints apart is not that easy to do.  I have to step on one side and pound the joint apart.  I'm not sure this is a bad thing because it can be kicked around, carried, etc with no worries it will come apart.  I'd rather have it be solid with a little difficulty getting it folded.

Pro: It's lightweight thus can be carried around, transported and hung easily.

Con:  It's lightweight so if it is windy the soccer goal falls forward quite often.  I usually have to buy someone gym back (or two) on the back pipe to keep it weighted down.",4.0
Seems to be made well. Haven't used it yet.,4.0
Son loves this. A little bit confusing to put together but one you do it's great.,4.0
"Very nice, sturdy nets. Perfect size. It doesn't fold as easy as they say.",4.0
"We were pleased with our purchase, the kids love it.",4.0
This mylec net is a fun and cheap alternative to buying a metal version. The net is good quality and the only downside I've experienced is a quick wrist shot or slapshot will dislodge the bottom pipes and do so regularly. This can be fixed with the glue/apoxy that is commonly used with PVC but you'd lose the folding aspect of the net.,4.0
"I run a local soccer league and was using pop-up goals for 3 1/2 - 4 1/2 year old soccer players.  I decided to replace the old pop-up goals with this.  This was a great investment.  It costs less than pop-up goals and is more stable.  It isn't really folding (in my opinion) but it definitely is easy to take apart and put together.  I have been using it now for two years so it is more than worth its weight in gold.  I am located in Florida and these goals are stored outside all year round.  They have been able to withstand the Florida sun and heat during the two years.  It no longer looks brand new, of course, but it is holding up well despite the harsh weather.",4.0
It will fall apart on you unless you use a rubber mallet to bang the pipes into the connectors. The net is a little to saggy and the hockey ball gets stuck in it. Good goal for the price though. Very light weight easy to carry to the park.,4.0
as described,4.0
"So far so good, but had to knock a star off since the assembly instructions lead you to believe that you are missing parts.  Because the 50"" upper and lower bars are double-labeled, the diagram seems to indicate that there are four when in fact there are two.  To fold the unit for storage, simply slip out the diagonal member from the two tees and the pop the bottom out of the two elbows.  Hopefully the net will prove sturdy over more use!

When I saw ""foldable"" in the product description, I figured that the goal was hinged.  It is not, but I am okay with the procedure (described above) to fold it.",4.0
Very nice easy to build and lots of fun to use.,4.0
"Easy to assemble. Took me about 15-20 minutes. Made out of pvc parts so when assembling, they'd sometime pop off at the joints.",4.0
"Don't know how folding is supposed to happen. This is made of pvc pipes with pvc joints. No folding possible. You can pull it apart and pile it together, but that's more like disassembling it. Comes with a net that slides over it as you put it together. Easy to figure out and assemble. Durable. Not foldable.",4.0
"Does the job. It is basically PVC piping, but the lightness makes it easy to move around. You'll have to weigh it down with something to keep it from blowing over in a fair wind.",4.0
Good quality net for kids who want to play soccer in your yard.  A little awkward to put together but is reasonably sturdy when done.  My only beef is the color came out more maroon than red.  Otherwise it's a great design for active kids and no worry about them tearing it up.,4.0
Breaking them down and reassembling is a pain. They're nice if you have room to store them.,4.0
It works great,4.0
This is a nice product.,4.0
"Great goal post. No instructions but after awhile I finally figured it out. I would glue some pieces together as they come apart pretty easily. Also I would add concrete to the bottom pvc poles to help with keeping it stationary. It doesn't blow over but just to make it heavier and more stable. The kids and neighborhood kids all love these. We bought 2 for more fun! Overall, with a few little minor tweaks well worth the purchase considering it would cost more to DIY.",4.0
Good,4.0
The tubes tend to come out of place a little too easily otherwise very durable and nicely sized for PE class.,4.0
The net is too large and balls get caught but it is a good quality net!,4.0
"I like the net it is holding up well so far, my only warning is the company I bought if from, premium sports, did not wrap the box, so you could see what it was, ruining the surprise factor.  I bought 2 other smaller nets and they were both wrapped in grey plastic wrap, so for that reason I would not Recomend premium.",4.0
"Net is pretty weak, but overall good",4.0
"Ordered this for my 2 yr old grandson at my son's urging ( I thought he was too young for it but his dad knew best). They are having a great time passing and shooting pucks into it...yes, we start 'em young here in the northeast! My son likes the sturdiness of it and the fact that he can fold it up for easy storage.",4.0
"Pretty easy to set up (if you follow the instructions), holds together pretty well.  The ""folding"" feature is difficult - it would be nice if the PVC pipe and fittings fit together a little better, since the pipe usually either barely fits into the corners, or it's difficult to get the pipe out.  But if you thump the pieces together with a rubber mallet and don't try to get them apart again, it's a terrific piece of equipment.",4.0
"Arrived as described.  Once organized, installation was straight forward. The product is a great size, but very light.  That could be good for some.  My biggest complaint is the net is too big.  The balls / pucks get tangled and difficult to get out.  I tie back excess and it works well.",4.0
"A good net for young kids to learn how to play hockey, but I can't see it lasting for years of physical abuse. The plastic pipes seem to be a little flimsy, probably couldn't handle too many slap shots. It is nice that it collapses for easy storage.",4.0
I bought this for my son and I to practice in the driveway - It is very easy to set-up. Sturdy and great for pick-up games too!,4.0
"This net was easy to put together, but it didn't come with instructions other than the pictures on the box. We actually put it together wrong the first time! The sides and top/bottom are different sizes. Either way works, but one results in alot more slack in the net! I measured them to know which should be on the sides. There is more slack in the net than I would have expected...not tight at all. The part about being able to fold flat for storage was a big selling point for me, but when I figured out that you have to disconnect some of it to do it, I was a little disappointed! So, it sits outside under the deck. Overall, I'm happy with it.",4.0
I use it to practice shooting at home. My kids also use it for soccer in the backyard. The PVC tubing seems pretty durable. Would have given it 5 stars except that hard slap shots will move it unless you put a weight on the back or up against something.,4.0
"Im sure this would be a nice net for street hockey. If you put it on ice and shoot a real puck at it the PVC will shatter, trust me :)",4.0
"My kids love the two goals we have for soccer in the back yard.  The construction is solid, and easy to put together. We've had it out in sun and rain for over a year (the first one we bought) and it hasn't suffered noticeably.",4.0
"I'll certainly be taking the advice of a couple of reviewers and will be gluing the small side poles to the back one as they come out way too easily, but it's a good, basic net. I'm using it to shoot pucks in the back yard in between hockey seasons and it's working out great. I needed to tie up part of the netting as it's a bit too lose and kept tangling the pucks, but it's a multipurpose net, so I can't complain. Setup was actually a little harder than I thought (I generally barely look at instructions) as I had to pull out a tape measure to figure out which piece was what, but otherwise, was a piece of cake. It's sturdy, stable (once I glue in those back pieces) and, for me, was an absolutely perfect purchase. It allows me to get some shooting exercise and practice my aiming. If you're using it for a game, it *is* rather light weight, but that also makes it great for me as I can move it around easily. I didn't give it 5 stars as, well, it's not perfect, but then perfect would cost a LOT more money, and I also don't have a wicked slapshot, so I'm not likely to shoot through the back of it. For the cost though, it's awesome.",4.0
"This is a nice setup here. Easy to assemble, easy to take down and transport or store it away. 1 annoying problem, everytime I move it while it is assembled the center pipe comes out of the end that is on the ground, I am constantly putting that piece back together. This goal is a great match with the Goalie attachement I reviewed on ""The Zon"" also.",4.0
"The net was easy to assemble. It is light weight and is easy to move. However, the weight also makes it less stable when taking shots, it tends to move around a bit.",4.0
"I got this just to shoot hockey balls at in the backyard.  Wanted one for quite a while, and didn't know they were this affordable.  Fairly easy to put together.  Sturdy enough.

Two minor complaints:

1) Some of the fittings are not snug / tight, meaning that the goal comes easily apart when you don't want it to (puck / ball hits it, you move it).  I ended up using pvc glue in a couple connections.  Now it stays together, and this was an easy solution, however, it won't be able to be taken apart or folded up, which is fine for me.

2) Net could fit a bit snugger.

Overall, good quality, sturdy (with some connections glued together), light and small enough to be stored.  Plus, not expensive.

This was a good purchase I am happy with.",4.0

"At under twenty bucks, this is a great value as a pool toy.
A pool toy, mind you, not a boat.

Yes, it can accommodate 1 person, but that had best be a very small person, such as under 100 pounds.
We live on a calm lake, but because waverunners and power boats often violate the no wake zone close to the seawall, this 'boat' stays in the pool. And visiting kids just love it.
I like that it is sturdy enough for rambunctious kids, and does not deflate even after days in the hot sun.
Great value as a fun pool toy, and if the description focused on it being best for kids instead of implying it's '1-person', I'd give 5 stars. It deserves 4 1/2 stars as it is, so please consider my experience with it to be on the high side of 4 stars.",4.0

A little small. One adult sized floatie. Floated fine down 20 miles of the Colorado River. Performed fine for what I wanted. Ordered five so we could race down the river. All five made it fine. No holes or leaks. Easy to paddle since the boat is small you can just hang your adult legs out the back and kick away. Has enough room to carry two beers plus one passenger. If you want a 6 pack better get a bigger sized boat as my two beer were gone long before we made the beach down river.,4.0

It's definitely an overpriced product in my opinion, but overall a decent buy for old time's sake. I read on several websites that the Boppers got smaller, which makes sense due to safety hazards, but it would have been nice to receive the original size.

The worst part about these is that they take forever to deflate.

"Amazon lists this as ""Sock'Em Boppers"", the ORIGINAL blow-up boxing gloves from the 90's, but what you will get is ""Sock'Er Boppers"". NOT SOCKEM BOPPERS. The covers are exactly the same though. And it's basically the same thing.

The toys are fun. I bought them for my little nephews for Christmas 08 and I ended up using it most of the time and beating up my cousins with it. I followed the advice of many here and didn't inflate it all the way, which helped in the removal process. GET 2 if you can, it's more fun that way.

And also, I saw these exact ""Sock'ER Boppers"" at Toys R Us for 13.99, about 1 or 2 dollar difference than what I paid here. So if you want to save some dollars, you can just drive to your Toys R Us and they should have them there.",4.0

"I was able to get my hand inside to test this out, but adult use is not recommended as this is intended for children only, as it could cause injury. Using excessive force to remove a hand from the chamber poses a risk. If there is a problem getting a hand out it is advised to deflate first. The chamber cushions the wrists and hands of my children inside the pillow. This also comes with a small patch in case of puncture. The valves are easy to fasten and can be opened and released for deflating. This is made of 12-qauge vinyl with the logo on the top part of the Sock'em Boppers.

With either choice to inflate the Sock'em Boppers you will need to avoid over inflating and should stop before filling it too tightly with air. When the hand has been inserted you just need to make a fist and this will keep the pillow secure in the hand of the child playing. It does not hurt when you are punched by the Sock'em Boppers and let's kids get rambunctious in a fun productive way. Caution children when playing not to hit near the face and eyes and to avoid sharp and hot objects when using the pillows. This is not a flotation device.

The box also lists two games for kids to play, consisting of tight rope bop and one foot sock for alternative ideas. My two children are enjoying this freestyle play, plus my older son likes to take breaks from doing homework and can take out his frustrations in a fun and appealing manner.

When using this outdoors take note of any hooks you might have on fences and stay in the middle of the yard. This would work well for boys and girls for parties and events at the park. The recommended age is from five to twelve. This is one of those As Seen on TV items that is worth purchasing, good for when kids are cooped up indoors when it is raining or snowing.

We just picked up another box over the Thanksgiving weekend.  Both my kids have autism and enjoy playing with the boppers.  My ten year old easily pumped them both up.  The only downside is where to store them.",4.0

"I've been told that I have some anger issues because my temper is red-hot sometimes. Sometimes I have to go see Dr. Bertrand for something my parents call ""anger manegment"". Basically, Dr. Bertrand has been trying to find ways to get me to express my anger, so that I don't end up ""seriously hurting someone"", or ""wind up in prison"". I'm not too happy about this, but I guess I really have got into some situations over the years, so I guess I can KIND of see their point.

The thing is though, none of them EVER seem to be my fault. It's ridiculous when I think about all of the times I've been in trouble, and how it's always someone else to blame, but they pin it on good-ol' Tuttleman anyways. They see me as an easy-target because of my brute-strength and strong belief in self-defense methods. The best example was when last year, my dad had just sprayed some kind of chemical on the lawn and told me to make sure that no one walked on it for the rest of the day. I guarded that lawn like a HAWK from the porch. The stupid paper-kid rode his bike right through my perimeter so I had to take action due to my dad's orders. I used the garden hose as sort of a lasso, simply to try to gently pull him and his bicyle from the lawn onto the drive-way. Well, the kid ended up coming off of the bike and re-injuring an old foot-sprain that he got earlier that year. The kid TOTALLY sold the injury like he was dying, and his family threatened legal action against me. Of course, I'M the one who my dad was mad at even though I was just following orders. Now, since we are not allowed to recieve the Detroit Free Press anymore, I am now forced to pick up the paper for my dad every day as some kind of passive-aggressive punishment.

Another time involved a punching spree that I went on trying to kill some renegade wasps in our yard when I was grounded a few years back. Dad's car got dented, the porch-light got torn down, I tore off some of the side-door molding and Mom's tomato garden got partially destroyed again. I couldn't even find the bee corpses to prove my innocence.

Now I admit, I do sometimes act in anger towards others, but ONLY if the situation warrants it. I have attacked a few people here and there (and a dog or two), but only when my life was threatened. Did you ever feel like you have had an out of body experience? I guess it's quite common. It's like when you can SEE yourself doing something, but when it's over you snap back into reality and say ""was that really me?, I never would have done that."" So how can you really be blamed for this!? This happens all of the time to me. It's like when someone ripped open all of Mr. Capelli's garbage bags on trash-night and spread trash all over his lawn and in the street. I ended up getting in trouble for it later that day. It wasn't my fault though. He had had some harsh words for me after an errant boomerang broke his window the day before. That night, it was like a dream; I could SEE myself ripping into the trash-bags with that rake. I couldn't stop it though. It was like watching your evil-twin try to frame you or something, right in front of your eyes, and you are powerless to stop it. When I finally snapped back into my body, I DID try to hide in his garage, but because I knew I was innocent and no one was going to believe my super-natural experience. Luckily, my parents said they would believe this (true) excuse, on the condition that I see Dr. Bertrand once every two weeks.

So that brings us to Dr. Bertrand's alternate methods of releasing your anger, or whatever he wants to call it. He asked me what something I love to do was. I told him I am quite the harmonica player. His suggestion was that instead of fighting with violence, I should keep my harmonica with me at all times (already do, doc) and play my lungs out on it whenever I lose my temper. This works some of the time I guess. He was pleased with my improvement, but just as a back-up plan he suggested I get something like this ""Sock'em Bop Buddy"" punching bag. He said I can punch this as MUCH as I want if I'm mad. Now if I'm mad at dad, Buddy suddenly morphs into him and I beat the tar out of him and scream and put choke-holds on him and bash him against the wall and hit him with tennis rackets, things of that nature. I can basically make Buddy morph into anybody in my basement. The major flaw in Dr. Bertrand's ""solution"" is that Buddy can't be everywhere with me at all times. Therefore, things happen, ya know? But whatever. Seeing Dr. Bertrand is making me look good so I don't get in as much trouble (""but mom! I'm trying to control my problem! I can't help it!"") heh heh heh

In conclusion, Buddy can be any person or animal you visualize him to be. Just a warning though, I'm already on my second Buddy-bag because I tried to bite a hole in his face during a fight with him when I visualized him as Dr. Bertrand. I told my mom that Morris did it anyways. Whatever. Buy the dumb toy if you want to. Later.

"I bought this Sock'em Bop Buddy from Toys R Us for my 4 year old daughter as she seemed to need a safe place to channel some aggression.  You can weight the bottom down with either sand or water from your kitchen sink.  There were two chambers to blow up and it wasn't that difficult as long as you have good lungs.  The best thing about this toy (unlike the old clown ones of the past) is that he calls out to you with each hit (he's motion activated).  He says things like, ""Is that the best you can do"", or ""Ouch, that's going to leave a mark"".  It was hilarious.  Unfortunately though, he sprang an air leak after about 5 days (and he was sitting in my carpeted family room) and had to be blown up twice a day to keep his shape.  After a day or two of that, he was beyond help.  The patch that came with him was dried up and unusable, so back to the store he went.  My daughter did love it though.",4.0
"My 7 year old son and 4 year old daughter love this toy!  They really go to town kicking and punching it.  They both took karate and think it is really fun to test out their moves.  I would highly recommend this toy.  Not to mention, it is very inexpensive.  It would make a great gift for someone else.  It is very durable and we used the water option to weight the bottom but I think the sand option as the weight would be much better.",4.0
I bought this for my son who likes to take out his extra energy on his sister.  When he gets mad we tell him to go take it out on his Bop Buddy.  It can withstand lots of kicks and punches.  He also uses it to practice his Karate.  It has been a great!!,4.0
"I was very disappointed at first because the pen didn't work.  I kept scratching it on paper and couldn't get the ink to flow.  I finally took the pen refill out and dropped it in a bowl of hot water from the tap (not boiling water, but a little too hot to be comfortable).  I came back in 20 minutes, took the pen refill out, and it immediately started writing.

Would be five stars if the pen would work out of the box without having to do this fix.  But I'm satisfied now that it does work and glad I didn't have to send it back.  It is a cute little knife otherwise and the dim red LED is okay with me... red LEDs are more efficient, so the batteries should last a while, and the color and dimness will help preserve your night vision.",4.0
"For everyday keychain duty, this is the mini-Victorinox to go with.  The Classic is a classic for a reason; its blade, scissors, and nail file-screwdriver are the light tools you're most likely to need in a day, in the smallest possible pacage.  The Signature Lite replaces the Classic's removable toothpick and tweezers with a pair of far more valuable tools:  a ballpoint pen and an LED light.

Neither is ideal; the light is relatively dim, by LED standards, and the pen isn't particularly comfortable for long-term writing, but having this SAK on your keychain is worth it:  you'll never be without a pen or a light when you need one.

Victorinox could sink a slam-dunk and get five stars if they'd use bright white LEDs instead of red ones (even if the knife cost a few bucks more).  This is a good product, but LED technology's moved on, and Victorinox isn't keeping up like they could.",4.0

"It works as advertised. Not a lot to say about a bike rack. I have hardly any wobble from mine, and I suspect those that do didn't assemble theirs correctly or aren't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough. My only complaint is the weight--it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack, which I don't quite understand. The vertical tube has the lowest load, with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube. But it's not that big a deal. It just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly.",4.0
"We also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes.  It could be improved on the Hitch end but it was not bad.  It does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches.  It kept our bikes from damaging our Suburban.  We use it for adult bikes and also several smaller BMX bikes.  It is more challenging to get the BMXs on.  One trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike, then tilt it back up for the other three.  Also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway. We also bought a big Schwin cable lock to run through the bike frames for security while parked.",4.0

After looking at several options on Amazon, I found one that seemed to get good reviews and was well priced.

The plastic and construction seems of good quality and I suspect that it will last quite a while if treated well.",4.0
This is such a great air pump!  Great purchase. Very easy to use and the air output on both the down and up pumps makes filling my kids inflatable pool and yard toys a breeze.

"I suggested my mother try these after years of problems with monster waterbugs in her suburban Philadelphia town house. With her living in an urban area blocks away from a river she has tried everything to rid her house of these disgusting creatures. Exterminators are only a temporary fix due to the fact that the waterbugs just leave and go to the adjoining house next door and then come back when the spray wears off. The roach traps get a few of them but didn't stop them from being in the bathroom and kitchen and scattering when she would turn the light on. The insect problems are bad this year due to our mild winter and when she saw them appearing in her bedroom something had to be done.
She installed these Lantek Pest Repellers a week ago and after encountering waterbugs in the spring/summer daily for years she has not seen one in her house since the day she plugged them in. Her home is very small (about 900 sq. feet) and she bought 2 (3 packs) so she was sure to have enough coverage. Although it does not seem to effect the tiny ants from coming in under the kitchen back door (where she has 2 plugged in) she would much rather have ants to deal with than the 2inch Philadelphia waterbugs. Although the neighbors probably aren't to happy right now because all of the critters probably ran to their house. The true test will be the next time we have a drought when the problem is usually the worst. That is when they come into the homes in mass numbers seeking water. But so far so good. I am going to order some myself to see if it helps with the Yellow Sac spiders and the huge numbers of bats that we have in our neighborhood that sometimes get into the homes. I do recommend these, they do work on certain insects but from what I have seen, not ants. The repellers are much smaller than what they appear to be in the photo (about 2x3 inches) which is a plus because we have a 1920 home with baseboard sockets and don't have to worry about them being too large to fit into the receptacle.",4.0
I purchased these to avoid being interrupted by my daughter twice each evening to kill spiders.

"an excellent watch that could use some downsizing, but its size gives the advantage of an easily readible face. could use a mineral crystal lens...even though plastic and inset, ...but the best feature is the fact that the easily obtainable battery is so easy to replace that the wearer is not discouraged from using the features as often as necessary. Unlike many other digital watches, the band still fits my 6 inch wrist with holes to spare. Although the operational functions are laid out well, I was lost in trying to remember how to operate the watch after storing it away for several months...after all, to download the manual is 50 odd pages. Still I think this is an excellent product that could be made better with the additions I mentioned.",4.0
"This watch has many great features, and few shortcomings. The bad first, and then the good: First; It is quite big. At first it seems like a hockey puck has been strapped to your wrist. Second; it uses a barometer to guage altitude, and therefore it requires some study, attention to detail, and monitoring and adjustment to get the most out of it.
Now the mitigating factors on these shortcomings: First (large size); while it is a bit large on your wrist, it is quite lightweight, and after a while, you get used to it. Overall, it is quite comforable to wear. The large control buttons are easy to use in winter with gloves on. And, the large display makes the data easy to digest. Second (barometer-based altimeter); all the other altimeter watches on the market work in much the same way, so this shortcoming should not disqualify this watch in comparison to other climbing/skiing watches.
Now the good: First; it has the features you need and not a lot of others you don't. Timekeeping, altitude, barometer. That's it. No other gadgets to confuse and add to the cost. Second; it's very rugged. I've abused mine heartily and it's stood up very well. Third; the features it does have are comprehensive and well executed. Fourth; assuming you master the arcane science of tracking altitude with a barometer -based altimeter, this one is quite accurate compared to some others I've tried (like the casio models).
Quick summary of features: the basic timekeeping functions are great! Time, date, multiple alarms, countdown timer, stopwatch, dual time zone -- all work easily and intuitively.
In Altimeter mode, the main display gives you your current altitude and a quick display of your recent trend. After this, it get complicated. The feature set is robust, and you'll have to spend some time with the manual to master it. It will measure just about anything related to going up or down a mountain that you could ever think of. It can also log these things and remember them for your future use. It can be changed from measuring feet per minute skied (for example) to feet per hour climbed. You name it, this thing can record and measure it.
What I use it for mostly, is just to show me where I am on the mountain in terms of altitude. To do this, you'll need to know what the actual altitude is where you start (parking lot, for example) and use that to set the altimeter. From there, the watch will keep an extremely accurate account of where you go from there. The only problem will be if a new weather pattern moves in. This will cause a change of barometric pressure and will affect the accuracy of the altitude reading.
In barometer mode, this watch will also give you a very accurate warning of a new weather pattern moving in -- as long as you are not changing your altitude substantially. As with the altitude mode, you can ask it to log data into memory to see trends and keep track of pressure over time.
In summary, it is an excellent tool for mountaineers and skiers. Used properly, it is a very accurate tool for navigation and weather forecasting. However, expect to spend some time with the user manual to master the features before you ask it to help save your life. I've tried several of the other watches on the market (Casio, Avocet, Nike) with similar features and this is the best of the bunch.",4.0
"I just used this watch for a recent backpacking trip and it was great.  At nights I would hang it in the tent to get the over night temp and during the day the altimeter helped our group determine our location and progress.  Recalibrating the watch was easy based on our campsite location on the topo map. Finally, the barometer was a good in indicator of the weather that we would be encountering.

This watch is also a cool conversation piece when it comes to skiing.  You can set it to do total number of vertical feet skied and when you get on the chair you can tell your partner the rate of decent on the last run.  Very cool watch!!!",4.0
"I bought this jig to fix some broken ballusters on my front porch.  I had never seen or used the jig or anything like it before, but knew if it worked as advertised, it would solve my problem.  After five minutes reading the instructions, I figured out how to get the ""pocket rocket"" jig to work.  Its very easy, but the clamp they included in the set is of limited use.  Haven't tried the rest of the jigs out yet, but when a use arises, I will update.",4.0
"This is a great little tool.  I found myself sitting through two demonstrations for this tool at a local woodworking convention.  I was amazed with how sturdy the joints are.  I have one of these jigs at home and have made a couple of things with it.  One item that I made was a stool, which perhaps isn't all that complex.  However, the amazing thing is that it has withstood being thrown around, kids jumping on/off of it and general wear and tear.  The joints are as sturdy today as they were when I first put it together.  The only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars is that I can't just find the screws at my local hardware store, and to order, they are on the pricey side.",4.0
"I bought this about two months ago and have been using it for a variety of purposes.  To preface, its become clear to me that pocket hole joinery is fabulous, not only in terms of strength of the joint itself but also relatively time efficient.
Overall the setup with the three different jigs is pretty neat.  I would recommend getting the whole kit rather than buying the components piecemeal.  For versatility and ease all three jigs will be very handy.
My gripes are the following.  First, the screw driving bit (two of them really) are made of cheap metal and easily strip after a few uses.  You'll have to go to a home center and get the DeWalt bit (this is not a plug) which is heavier and much more durable.
Next, these jigs themself are made out of plastic with metal inserts.  Durable plastic, but mind you they are plastic.  You'll have to take care of them to have them last.
The instructions are a bit disjointed.  You are actually given three different sets of instructions.  Not difficult to read but I would go over all of them before you start to use the tool.  Kreg's website is excellent as a supplement.
Overall a tremendously useful tool but for the money the value is fair at best for the reasons noted above...",4.0
