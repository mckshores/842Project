"I don't know why anyone still uses these things.  Everyone owns a vacuum, and if the nozzle doesn't match up perfectly we all know how to use duct tape.

Some people get the bag to work; others have problems.  But in the end it's the guys with the vacuum hooked up to it that end up walking away with little or no cleanup!

If you lost it and are looking to replace it, forget it and go buy a new blade with the money you save.",2.0
"For the price this is a rip off. First, the ""thin kerf"" is five thou thicker and a comparable dealt blade, but I knew that going in and banked on the ""legendary"" clean cuts that are touted on the internet. Second, my first cut after installing: burned wood. I figured there might be some shmew do I did a couple more and kept getting the same result. My conclusion is this blade is not a horrible blade but is definitely mostly hype. Returning.",2.0
"The step-down adapter co-marketed on amazon as  ""frequently bought together"" DOES NOT FIT. I have been scouring the web to find a way to attach my shop vac hose to this gizmo, .so I cannot rate this yet because I haven't been able to try it.",2.0
I found this to be flimsy and impractical. I sent it back immediately.,2.0
"I recently bought the PC97529 2hp router, and unfortunaltly found it to be a poster child for what seems to be a wide spread problem with new PC products.  I found this router to be over hyped and under powered. I am a profesional carpenter rely on my routers. PC has always been the standard for a rugged,reliable and well engineered router.  This router stalled out constantly on a project that it should have breezed through (rabbeting MDF) the trigger and saftey were stiff and awkward, the depth adjustment aggravatingly tedius and the dust shield a chincy prop designed to woo us with its appearance and not actually survive.  My router actually died after 2weeks.  This is the second PC router I have had fail on me this year.  The life of both was less than what I would expect for a craftsmen. My sense from this eperience and other recent eperiences with other PC tools is that PC is targeting hobbyists and empasizing packaging over quality this is forcing me into the arms of DEWALT and BOSCH.",2.0
"A good router with reasonably smooth plunging action, but with a few  problems that led me to trade it in for a Dewalt 625.  The depth  measurement rod/device is awkward and not as well designed as I would have  expected.  The overall power was much less than my old Sears 1 1/2HP  router; the P-C was practically stalling out in routing oak, where the  Sears was not hesitating.  The collets and the edge guide did work well,  the kit and case is quite nice, and my shop vac plugged into the dust port  with just minor adjustments.",2.0
"At face value this seems to be a very nice router but, upon closer inspection, the design has serious flaws.  First the base seems to be too thin of a casting as you can feel it bend if you put side pressure on it.  Base stiffness is critical for precise plunging. This unwanted flexibility  may be due to the dust extraction tunnels cast into the base.  Secondly the  plunge is not nearly as smooth or precise as the DeWalt 621 as there is a  lot of slop between the rods and their linear bearings. Third the plunge  lock works opposite to the way that it should.  Plunge locks should be  normally off and applied to lock.  This, as with all PC plunge routers, is  normally on and worked to release.  This is much harder to use when  mortising than the lock down method used on the DeWalt 625 and on Hitachi's  and Makita's large plungers. A minor point is that the plastic chip shield  is a joke as it falls off easily.  On both the DW621 and this PC turning  the router on and off requires a finger dance with the PC's being slightly  easier.  What's wrong with a simple trigger switch without all of the  clusmy, and in my opinion vastly more unsafe, so called safety switches?  Spindle locks are not a feature as is claimed as when the collet releases  you have a good chance of damaging the rods.  PC did a nice job of giving  you the option of using two wrenches which is a better way to chuck and  unchuck the bit without damaging the rods. Nice handles which is a plus.  This could have been a great router like the DeWalt 625. Instead it's  simply an acceptable one.",2.0
"I purchased this blade about 12 months back and was thrilled with it for about one month.  It cut through maple and cherry (up to 2"" thick) ""like butter.""  And then it was dull and prone to all the trials and tribulations of dull blades (kick-back, etc.).  When it was brand new it cut better than any blade I have owned but at the price it should!  At the price, it should also have retained its edge for a lot longer (I've had really cheap (Skil 10"") and mid-priced (Hitachi, et al) blades last MUCH longer and some even started off almost as sharp).

Again, for one month of 6 day a week use it was GREAT but it dulled much too quickly - regardless of the price (and yes, I did clean and treat the blade at the end of each day).  So, whyh pay the price unless it comes with free sharpening and a loner blade for the time it spends ""away"" every four or five weeks.

If the blade cost $50.00 I would rate it 3 to 3.5 stars.",2.0

"I could not believe that the PC teck said that plunge routers all have play in the shaft. The right side has such play that you can tilt the router base by applying pressure to one side even when locked and he said this is normal! I have a RE600 Ryobi that is solid in all positions.  I tested the DeWalt621 and with one post it was solid.  The depth adjustment is also very hard to set, you have to turn it many revolutions to get it to adjust. The dust shield falls off easily. I returned it after one day.",2.0
"Porter Cable has a design flaw with the trigger locking switch.  To use this in a router table, your must lock the trigger on and use a switch located on top of the router to turn it on.  The problem is the switch lock breaks easily and the router will not function properly.  I found this out the first time I used it in my table and sent it away to be fixed.  After the fix, the repair lasted 20 minutes.  I am now looking for another router to use in my table.  I will only use the 7529 for hand held applications where I constantly hold down the trigger myself.  Porter Cable should have a recall on this. I am not the only person with this problem.  I posted my problem on a tool chat room and other woodworkers shared the same story.  If you want to use this router for a router table, get another router.  Save yourself the trouble.",2.0
These blast gates clog and are difficult to clean.  After trying to get used to them they're going to be given away.  I hate these gates.  They suck.,2.0
"These gates clog often for me.  Since the blast door is contained, chips get jammed into the slot and they keep the door from closing completely.  Since these doors cannot be disassembled, they are difficult to clean.",2.0
"Yes it may be 4""s, however if the dust spout your hooking it up to is 4""s? the circumference is actually larger, therefore this won't work. Take a measurement before ordering this..",2.0

"I have a fein mutimaster that is 15 years old and for certain jobs cant be beat but the pad is really pathetic. I just purchased some new pads,installed it,installed  coarse grit sandpaper to avoid the dreaded heat build up and used it roughly 30 seconds then went to switch grits and as I was pulling the sandpaper off it pulled the velcro off along with the sandpaper. COME ON FEIN!!!!!!!!!",2.0
"These are nicely made plastic gates but require a lot of maintenance, because they clog up and wear out quickly.
I ended up throwing all my 15 blast gates away and replaced them with non-clogging Aluminum bast gates, Problem solved.
If you just have a couple machines, and don't care to spend time cleaning them, this may be the gate for you.
But blast gates are mostly used in a several machine set up, and for that I cannot recommend this product.",2.0
"It is difficult to comprehend Fein providing sanding pads and paper which are so useless.  I have had the sandpaper/pads melt in sanding just a 3/4"" X 2"" area.  Both the felt on the paper and the Velcro on the pad melted.  I went through 20 sheets of paper to sand a close-quartered area.  Whereas my B & D Megamouse did a 4-foot X 4-foot area with just one sheet.  Both on the same project.",2.0

This gate valve gets sawdust and wood chips stuck in the slide area and then the valve cannot be opened/closed.  It needs to be redesigned.,2.0

just a little off on the small side... but that's why they make duct tape I guess?,2.0
"I bought the adapter with the Big Gulp dust collector.
I expected this adapter to plug into the big Gulp.  No joy.
Output tube on Big Gulp is 4 inch. Adapter is also 4 inch.
Gorilla tape I guess....",2.0
"Bought and installed these when setting up dust collection in my woodshop.  Huge problem with these is that they trap sawdust and particles in the slot that the gate travels in.  The only way to clean out the slot is to remove the hose connected to it and use some type of wire to scrape out the debris.  I am considering cutting off the bottom of these so that the debris will fall out of the bottom and use tape to ""re-close"" them when in use.",2.0
"To avoid the clogging issue... I mounted mind horizontal... with a 4 in to 2 1/2 in reduced for a shop vac connection.  I was disconnecting a hose and down came the blast-gate and the reducer.  The gate split right in half... sharp end getting me right above my left eye... deep gash.  Doc said I was lucky... it could have taken out my eye!

So... what now?  Bloody head fixed... what to do with this broken gate...Well... since this is a design issue... a weak blast ""weld"" holding it together... I HIGHLY recommend that anyone using this as an end piece (not inline between twp pipes) you HAVE to reinforce the gate. I added foil tape to seal it on all three sides of the seem.  Then reinforced it with duct tape.  This is a cheap piece of plastic that WILL break apart on you if not inline between two pipes.

Before this happens to you...Stop what you are doing and go reinforce them right now!  Even if it seems solid now... it WILL break on you at some point.",2.0

"When I bought my table saw (PowerMatic) this is what showed up under ""People who purchased this also purchased this item"".....so without reading any of the reviews I bought it.......problem is ...it doesn't even come close to fitting the flange on my saw. It fits the vacuum hose just fine.
Thanks to duct tape...problem solved. Not exactly what I wanted...but I got it to do what it's supposed to do. I don't know where the fault lies but PowerMatic and Woodstock should get together on this ........but then duct tape sales might plummet.  : )  Good luck!",2.0
"On the positive side these are inexpensive, but on the negative side you get what you pay for.  I ordered 3.  They are simply two plastic plates with sliding plastic plate between.  Unfortunately on two of the three I think the Chinese were running out of glue the day the made two of the 3. The two plates which were suppose to be glued together were not and the two plates immediately separated.  Looks likes they used a drop of glue the size of a dime.  I was able to fix by gluing together with PVC cement.  So in the end they work fine, with some assembly required.",2.0

"I got his router to mount under a table for making doors. Not good for this appilcation at all. Bits are hard to change while base is mounted to table, and it didn't seem to have the power it said it had. Only lasted about 6 mons and then croaked. I replaced it with a Porter Cable. Should have gotten one of those in the first place......",2.0
"I gave this only 2 stars because the 4"" end did not fit on my table saw. It is the same diameter as the port on the bottom of my saw.
I don`t know if all saws are the same, but it did not work for my ridgid. I tried an adapter, but that brought it down too low for my adjustable wheels to work.  I ended up cutting it down.  "" WHERE THERE`S A WILL, THERE`S A WAY """,2.0
"I boight this router after reading and hearinf some good reviews on it. I've pwned it for a few months now but only took it out to use in the the last couple of days. I ran some roman ogee bits with 1/2"" shanks through it and it was perfect. It chewed though the wood flawlwss without loosing speed. It is definitely a good value for money machine if you don't mind it's flaws which I describe below.

I also like it's hefty feel and it's weight makes it stable when I use the router for freehand routing. The soft start feature is also great. I intend to build a router station in the future to house this green beast, but I am holding off until I find an easier way to master the art of changing bits with this time consuming system.

I have 2 complaints about it.

Firstly, the bit system involves holding a spring loaded sleeve (which locks the shaft for bit change)down and tightening the collet with a wrench using your other hand which should be free. I found it so difficult to hold the bit to the correct height (for some specialty bit) as well as hold the spring sleeve tightly locked so that the collet can be tightened with another hand.

I also own a craftsman router witn 1 3/4 hp and it has a switch lock which frees one hand to hold down thr router or to adjust router bit height while tightening the collet. I find the craftsman so much easier to change bits.

Secondly, the 1/4"" reducer collet will NOT hold 1/4"" shank bits down. No matter how hard I tighten the collet, my bits keep slipping out after monor cuts. I was using a dovetail bit with a dovetail jig and the bit just kept sliding further down as I cut! I had no problems with 1/2"" shank bits, only 1/4"" shank bits. Hitachi should do something about redesigning it's collet reducer to grip better.",2.0
"I bought this 4"" to 2 1/2"" adapter to be able to attach a shop vac to a new band saw that has a 4"" outlet.  This adapter is exactly the same size as the outlet, so it won't go inside or outside of the outlet.  I will probably keep it and duct tape it in place as it I can't seem to find one any different.  I know they exist because I got one with the chip collector on my DeWalt planer.",2.0
"I am novice to this dust collector stuff. But there should be more information from the manufacture about outside and inside diameter posted to the amazon web site.

I was looking for a dust collection nozzle reducer for my new bandsaw. I already had a Shopsmith dust collector with a 2 1/2-inch hose.  My new bandsaw has a 4-inch outside diameter dust collection port.  I wanted a reducer to directly attach to the bandsaw's 4-inch outside diameter port and then to the 2 -1/2 hose.

This reducer's outside diameter is 4-inches, the same as my dust collector.  I ended up buying a 4-inch inside diameter hose and then using this reducer.",2.0
"this does not fit on the Jet saw, we had to rig it up with dryer hose to be able to hook it up to the dry vac :((  it's not 4"" it's 3 3/4"" which doesn't fit over the piece on the saw",2.0
"Its delivered to your house and you think that you are now ready to cut dadoes on your table saw, and for making dadoes on large peices of plywood, your right.  However, do not be fooled like I was when you think you are ready for all dado cuts with this insert.  When you try to cut a more detailed cut such as a tongue and groove joint, where the height of the dado will not be hidden, you will notice that the insert is far from flush with the top of the table, making the height of the cut on smaller peices noticeably inconsistent.  To fix this problem, I had to run out to my local hardware store, fork out more of my money to replace the four very small screws that came with the insert, and play with them to get the height flush.  The unfortunate part is that these screws have to be just about perfect in length to make this adjustment or the heads of the screws will stick out beyond the countersunk holes.  What I would really like to know is how a company with such a reputable name like Delta, can manufacture an insert for its own table saw and still require the consumer to make adjustments like this?  Frankly, I am growing tired of building quality furniture with tools that lack the same quality.",2.0
It does not fit the dust unit.  At least the one that does fit came with the unit I bought I wish I knew before ordering this one  I lost $5.00 or $6.00 on this deal.,2.0
"I was under the impression that this would fit the dust port on my R4512 table saw and connect directly to my shop vac hose, but I ended up with a series of plumbing boots and hose clamps and an elbow from an aluminum dryer vent to make it work.

Live and learn, I guess...",2.0
"I have purchased my MV12 a couple of weeks ago. It is indeed a pretty good deal on a HP / $ ratio basis.
I have the following gripes:
1) It has a 2 piece collet, NOT the spring steel 3 piece self-releasing system DeWalt and other high quality routers  tend use. In this price range, I would expect a 3 piece  collet. Check any of the router books such as Spielman, and  they will tell you that 2 piece is not the best  collet system.
2) There are 2 template mounts that protrude into the router's well, that effectively prevent you from using large diameter bits ( e.g.: panel raising, lock miter).  I have talked to Hitachi techical support and they said: - Cutting off those mounting flanges will invalidate the warranty. - You should not use a router for large bits like that, you should use a shaper. The router was meant to be used with bits that fit between the mounts.
IMHO one of the primary reasons why you would want a high HP, variable speed router (Note Variable Speed!) is to put it in a router table and use large diameter bits.",2.0
"This is a good quality hose and it will replace the worn out hose that came with your shop vac but there is something else to consider.  Although this hose will fit into a standard shop vac the accessories that came with your shop vac such as the extension tube, crevice tool, etc. MAY NOT FIT THE OTHER END OF THIS NEW HOSE! only Mr. Nozzles accessories or accessories that use a 1 1/2"" I.D. hose end will fit this hose, and Mr. Nozzle does not have alot of accessories to go with this hose so you may end up with a great hose but a poor nozzle etc. at the end of it.",2.0
"I have had this table for about 2 years and after using it regularly, I really can not recommend it.  Here are a few gripes

1) The box becomes an echo chamber for your router.  Routers are loud to begin with, this thing is like having a router inside of a bass drum.  the entire box vibrates and basically amplifies the sound.

2) It came with the wrong sized allen-head screws for adjusting the router plate.

3) The router plate gets screwed down with 2 screws only (from the top), in opposite corners.  If for some reason the plate ends up sticking up in a corner without a screw, there is no way to make it flat.

Yes, it is made of decent quality materials and seems like a good deal for the price.  In hingsight, I with I would have spent a little more on a better table.",2.0
"I bought this hoping I could slide it onto the outside of my tablesaw dust port and attach my shop vac hose to it.  Both the outside of this adapter and the outside of the tablesaw port are 4"".  In other words it is a male to male connection.  I could not find a female version.

The solution I found was to get a 45 degree pvc plumbing joint for about $3.  I could not find any other plumbing part that fit snugly, all the others were loose.  The elbow holds the reducer snugly as well as the port from the tablesaw.  I epoxied the adapter to the pvc elbow.  You can then tape or glue the elbow to your tablesaw port as you desire for your purposes.  This method worked a lot better than spending another $25 on a 4"" hose that I did not need.

Here is a link to the part at home depot:  [...]",2.0
"The dimensions given are not stated whether they are inside or outside, but I bought it  anyway because it was not expensive. I found that the large end was the same as the fitting on my table saw so I have to fashion a sleeve to make it work. Having said that it fit my shop vac perfectly and it works fine.",2.0
Not as robust as I first thought. Doesn't last that long and when applying pressure it tends to warp. Not for commercial application.,2.0

"I'm sure this throat plate is fine for the correct saw, but Amazon has poor lableing. I had to return it. Listing it as the insert for 'Delta Contractors Saws' is an error.

The claw tool is too big to fit into the hose cuff.  Useless!,2.0
"I think the hose itself is probably decent quality, as are the attachments, but for my Ridgid vac, this cut the suction power at least in half. It MIGHT be useful on a smaller, less powerful vac than mine (5HP/12 g), but I'd be cautious. The end of the hose that takes the nozzle is a somewhat flexible piece that you have to work the attachment into. I don't know if that's good or bad but it appears that at least on that end, the attachment shouldn't come out. Just didn't work for me and I'm returning it.",2.0
"I purchased this router table after reading many reviews on various products. I imagine most people completed their review prior to using it. The cabinet is beautiful, well constructed, and works well as a contractor unit.  However, I needed to purchase the ""large plate"" in order to fit my router, and am now stuck with a plate that with poor clearance to its optional rings.  The rings need to be shimmed every time you change them or your work witl catch on the plate. If I had to do it over, I would have spent the $$ on an Incra table top/fence.",2.0
"I'd give this table a solid four stars be it not for several careless manufacturer blunders (mind you, I purchased this new, not used or refurbished, so the contents of the box were seemingly untouched):

1. The enclosed manual was for Bench Dog's Pro Cabinet (a much different item). It took a couple of seconds of scratching my head in search of the parts described in step 1 of the assembly instructions before I bothered to glance at the front of the manual. I had to download and print the correct manual from the manufacturer website.

2. Several holes were woefully misdrilled. Rather than screwing directly into the wood, most surfaces are joined by machine screws that thread into perpendicular metal cross dowels. This is great for the durability of the table. There are a series of pre-drilled, intersecting holes that accepted the screw and cross dowel, respectively. However, two or three of mine were misdrilled with the cross-dowel hole in the correct location but the would-be intersecting hole 2+ inches off. I had to drill a few myself.

3. Furthermore, two screws were missing, and I could not fully affix the metal track until the manufacturer sent the screws (yeah, I could have gone to Lowe's and procured what I needed, but it was the principle of the matter).

To the manufacturer's credit, they sent me a copy of the correct manual and the missing screws.

My only other nit: I wish it came with a switch. It seems like comparable tables in this price range include switches.

Now that it's assembled, no complaints. It's a solid build and a good weight--heavy enough not to slide around but light enough to be moderately portable. I haven't had it long enough to comment on the rigidity of the plate, but I don't expect it to warp. And unlike Bosch (who doesn't even sell blank drillable plates for their tables!),  it accepts my router without customization (Dewalt 621). Assembly is simple enough IF you have a manual, IF you have the requisite parts, and IF it's pre-drilled properly.

In short. I'm happy...now. I was not at all happy throughout what should have been an easy assembly process. I hope it was an isolated incident. If it was, then I'd recommend the table (buy a switch, too). But if this is par for Bench Dog's course, well, you might as well save yourself the hassle and look elsewhere. As for me, I have to dock them a couple stars, because it was really carelessly prepped and packaged.",2.0
"I expected more from Delta.  While the mechanism that turns the wheels runs smooth, the large wheel needed to be dresses up.  It is very soft, so much wheel is lost during sharpening if you are not careful.  The drain  plug for the water basin is far too small.  The tool rest for the dry  grinder is cheap stamped steel, what you would expect from a cheap import.  The tool rest for the wet wheel was is cast aluminum (no rust) but instead  of using a milling machine to surface it, they used a belt sander, so it is  not very smooth, which causes tools being sharpend and the cheap sliding  miter to catch while sliding back and forth.  If you are looking to sharpen  hand planer blades, or wood chisels it is difficult to get a straight edge  with this ""grinder"", but it puts a nice edge on an ax (so does a  good whetstone for far less $$).",2.0
Impossible to find a good fit to my Craftsman vac. No relief to back off vacuum pressure which was very helpful for selective vacumming with theCraftsman handle. after three different attempts at adapters I finally cut up a wand.

"I was really hoping that all the reviews about the Bench Dog table were true.  I was incredibly disappointed that one of the wooden case pieces was drilled incorrectly.  I expect that for a $300 router table (which is twice the cost of my Porter Cable router) should not have such a major manufacturing flaw.  I called Bench Dog and they will send me a new part, but now I will have to go about a week without a working table.  This is totally throwing off my project schedule.

"Don't buy this set unless you can't get the stick and block separately. The featherboard is complete trash and should be thrown away immediately. I haven't used the stick, though it looks like you could make a longer and nicer one in a few minutes. I do, however, use the push block all the time and have found it to be very useful. There are certainly applications were it doesn't work that a custom one would, but that's always the case.

Probably should not have given it that little love tap, but still, it could'n't stand up to a little abuse.",2.0
Huge airflow loss. Better to use flexible duct in a gradual arc.,2.0
"There is a sticker on the insert that states it is compatible with the Dewalt DWE7491RS 10"" table saw. Well maybe. If you want to use your riving knife for this model saw, you have to cut all the way through to the end of the insert. Which means you have to lift the insert by the finger hole and drag it through the blade. Although it does fit in the saw opening, I cannot get it to adjust such that it fits flush with the saw table top. There just isn't enough adjustment screw length. Overall I'm very disappointed with this insert for this model saw. Another issue is the lack of locking mechanism like the factory inserts. It probably would not be a problem if the insert fit flush in the opening but on my saw it will wobble because the friction mechanism on the side of the insert is enough to hold it in place.",2.0
"I've thought about buying one of these holsters for quite some time now. Usually, if I'm fortunate enough to remember to bring it, I use one of the various hooks that are available on the market.

Alas... I was mistaken. With my DeWalt 14.4, the holster wants to twist and turn with my every movement. If I stand still, it's fine. When I climb a scaffold, or a ladder, or walk anywhere -- the drill is not where I left it. Often it has twisted itself inside the holster in such a way that I can't get it out with one hand. Hardly an improvement over holding it between my legs.

Perhaps if the holster had a strap at the bottom to hold it against the leg this wouldn't be an issue.

I haven't given up yet. I'll try a few more configurations with the holster, but so far it's been sitting in my truck. It's too big to use with either set of nail bags I have, and even on it's own the above-mentioned problems make it more trouble than it's worth.",2.0
"although the construction is impecable the holster really needs a leg belt to stay stable, also the pouch will not work well with t handle drills like a milwaukee, or small drills like 7.2 volt B&D.  works greak with dewalt, but thats it as far as i can tell, better off buying the hook...",2.0
this didn't work like I expected.  Read the fine print its for large particles the fine dust found its way into the shop vac.  Buy the Dust Deputy Cyclone which I did.,2.0
"This item is substantial in appearance and heft. However, in usage, it loses it's charm when you put your pieces of wood together and discover they are not flush as expected. I thought that the culprit was me, but it was the tool. After several attempts in re-doing the doweling, results were the same. When I began to examine the tool I noticed that the center guide had about 1/16"" inch of play after it was securely clamped. That small amount is enough to defeat it's intended purpose of excellent fit. I figured out an inexpensive modification that corrected the problem. It involved using two set-screws that held the center guide in place, and can be adjusted to fit any thickness of wood. Why didn't the manufacturer dope this out?
Right now, anyone who uses it will get horrible results until it is modified.",2.0
"You get what you pay for.  To get this to work, you will need to make numerous modifications to how it connects to a bucket and to jimmy rigging the hoses to the lid.  .",2.0
"Okay so for the price, this is a decent solution for making a 2 stage dust collection on a budget or limited work space. Without adding or making changes, this provided not so great suction. I have to make mods to make it function better.
Updated May 11 2017:
I added a rubber weather strip on the inside, where it covers the 5 gallon bucket. This improved the suction, however I need to add silicone where the 2 hoses connect and add a base with casisters to prevent the bucket from tipping over.",2.0
"its worth the money ,, you must put a foam adheasive strip to keep it from leaking.. it also flexes its not very sturdy and no way to clamp it to a bucket but yes I am happy I got it,,, just cost me time to fit it",2.0
"fits a 5 gallon bucket perfectly, although it might be better with weather sealer. keeps tipping the bucket over but that's not the fault of the product. not the best dust collection accessory, but the best for the price i was willing to pay at this time

update after a few months 2 stars: a dust deputy would have been much better, should have saved up. the bucket tips over very easily so the vacuum sucks up the dust. so i need to strap the ducket to vacuum to prevent that. and the bucket cannot be filled more that 3/4, something extra to worry about. bit disappointed",2.0
"Takes a bit of customization to get this thing to work. I bought this along with a 5 gallon bucket. The Cyclone Separator doesn't securely sit on top of the buck you'll need to fasten it on there somehow. I used a couple of screws, and some weather seal, foam strips on top of the bucket. I use this along with a shop vac, so I had to modify the holes to fit my hose (1-5/8""). So I bought some adapters and an extra hose. I modified the adapters to fit the holes, and everything seemed to work.

It captures about half of my dust, and the other half goes into my shop vac. Better than having it all in my shop vac, but was hoping it would capture more. I don't have experience with other systems, so I'm not sure what I was expecting.

The build quality is a hard plastic, pretty thin, but stay rigid. It's a simple vacuum molded piece, not much to it.  For the price I guess it is what it is, but I think I should of just spent the extra money and gotten a dust deputy or something.",2.0
I had to glue fittings in other than that it works well. Seals good on garbage can when turned on,2.0

Fast Shipping Item as described Thank you,2.0
I had to glue in a piece to receive the hose for this to work. It also does not snap on to a bucked so I had to come up with a way to strap it down.,2.0
Product does not seal against 5 gallon bucket. After putting some foam double sided tape around the inside edge to seal against the 5 gallon bucket and strapped it on with a bungee cord it did finally seal. Would not recommend this product for anyone who would try and collect dust or small debris. I will be using it collect water and then draining out the bottom of the 5 gallon bucket for my purpose and the one job I have it will work just fine. I will be throwing the whole thing in the dumpster when the jobs over. Truly disposable,2.0
"The Bessey angle clamp requires that you align all edges and provide pressure -- all simultaneously -- while you tighten the one clamping handle.  It is less convenient than corner clamps with two separate  clamping handles to tighten separately.  Their large surface area provides  solid alignment, even if it also makes these clamps more appropriate for  larger tasks (e.g., over one foot per side).",2.0
This would work fine BUT I had problems finding a reducer to fit my brand of a shop vac.  I gave up looking on the internet to find a reducer and return this.,2.0
"I read in WOOD magazine that applying some weatherstripping helps to keep the lid on the bucket when in use.  It really doesn't do much, esp. when you factor in the big, relatively inflexible shop vac hose, too.  So while this separator does in fact, separate the heavy chips from the dust, it's quite a hassle to use.",2.0
"I just received my dust collection hood and it is not what is shown on Amazon's web page. The most significant difference is the the outlet port is located in the center of the lid and requires inserting the hose vertically. This appears to be a cheaper and possibly less efficient design.

With a hose exiting from the center of the hood, it will be more difficult to weight down as one commenter has suggested doing. It is also likely to require additional support to prevent the outlet hose from kinking.

I expect that if you have a suction on the outlet that is sufficient, that it will create its own vacuum seal and weighting down the lid won't be necessary. The lid could still be weighted down, but not with a 10 lb barbell weight as mentioned by another reviewer.

Further, the hood is not specifically for a 30g metal trash can. There are 2 concentric foam seals on the underside. One will fit a smaller trash can and the other will fit on larger cans. The label says ""fits on most standard plastic and metal garbage cans"".

You will notice that the model no. is shown as W1049 twice in the description on Amazon. However, when you get to the ""product details"" section towards the bottom of the page, it says JW1049 - which is what I received.

I started the return process online but found that the only option available to me is to return for replacement of exactly same product. That seems fruitless!

I have rated it 2 stars (I don't like it) but I have yet to test it in operation.

6 December - Received the replacement from Amazon. Their customer service response was great. HOWEVER, the replacement is exactly the same as what I received the 1st time, i.e. what you see is not what you get. I have rarely had any problems with Amazon but I am guessing that in this case, the product they are shipping has changed and their description and picture of it have not. I am currently attempting to arrange for a return and full refund so I can get what I want from another vendor.",2.0
"I don't understand why this vise is so well thought of.  While I understand why the jaws are not parallel (designed that way, so the top contacts first).  The mount to the work bench is not square. ??  Casting is poorly done, but this is just cosmetic.  There are only two holes for mounting to the bench.  Inadequate, I feel.  Just ordered Lee Valley equivalent, hoping for the best.",2.0
"Ok, I haven't even used this prouduct yet, but I'm already disappointed in it.
  First and foremost, it's not cut to the right sizes. The fit over the top of four different Home Depot 5 gallon buckets is loose at best.  The hose ports are also sized incorrectly, and the standard connectors don't 'grab' at all.  In fact, just to see what would happen, I tried a 2 1/2"" extension wand in one of the openings and it sank in almost 3"" before it tightened up in the hole.  I'd imagine that any control this thing is supposed to have over the airflow in the bucket would be destroyed by that big a change in the postion of the inlets.
  This lid also isn't made of the typical shop-vac type high-impact ABS, but rather a very brittle, shiny plastic that probably won't take any rough knocks in the shop if you should drop something on it.
  I'm going to try to bungie the lid down to a bucket to keep it tight, and cut up a few hoses and see if I can make them snug up in the ports.  If it works, I'll post an addition to this write-up explaining how I did it.
  For now, beware.  Even if you get this thing to work, it'll be with some scratch building and home rigging.",2.0
"For that price it should come with the hoses show in the picture and have a way to clamp them on at least, boy I would have been pissed if I had ordered this and didn't get the stuff shown in the photo!",2.0
"I have always been a fan of Milwaukee products. I own several, so when this sawzall came out I just had to buy it. I don't use them everyday or for heavy construction mostly cutting thru 2x4's I went thru 2 of these in a year. The first one lasted a few months and I used it about 20 times  I thought I must just have gotten a bad one. I purchased another and it lasted 5 cutsand burned out. I now own the new 13 amp Bosch and couldn't be more pleased. It vibrates but gets the job done and in the end thats what matters most because in my business time is money.",2.0
"This is THE recip saw, from the inventors of the tool, look at all the reviews on here. So why have I burnt 2 up in a year, and I'm just a weekend warrior? While it was working, it was sweet: cuts well (a comment about orbital action, I was told by support that it only takes effect with the pressure of being pushed into the cut, but I didn't notice any difference in cutting speed), toolless blade change, toolless shoe adjustment, anti-vibrating thingy, detachable power cord (by the way, this is standard Milwaukee, I have a right angle drill and a grinder from them, makes it easy to replace if you ever cut through it, I wish more tool makers would do this) and it just feels nice in your hands. What I've got now is the blade doesn't move at all and it makes a loud whirrr sound, I think it's the clutch (someone, somewhere told me that it has this to protect the gears, frankly I don't think you could possibly hurt the gears, but on my dime to ship is a clutch cheaper for their service dept. to replace?). Another possible cuplrit is the orbital action, for this reason you might consider the 10amp from Milwaukee which doesn't have this 'feature', one less thing to break.  Since this has happened to me twice (the first time it was right out of the box, so I figured I got a lemon) I came here to shop for a new saw and decided to see if this has happened to anybody else, but I guess not (how could this be? I was only making plunge cuts into solid logs...) Well I'm off to shop for a new saw.",2.0
"Tiny, much smaller than I expected. Pretty much useless. I wanted these to use on the edge of my welding table.",2.0
"This saw is simply not, as its name implies: ""Precision"". I was unable to cut accurate 45 degree miters. The 14 TPI blade was dull, or at least slow, when new and quickly deteriorated. I have been unable to find any store that sells replacements. Both Home Depot and Lowes have discontinued the blades. Lacking precision and replacement blades the tool is useless.",2.0
"I recently purchased the Jorgensen precision miter box and it worked very well for cutting moldings. When cutting heavier material, however, the cuts were several degrees out of square.  I am guessing the blade which came with the miter box has gotten dull and needs to be replaced.  Unfortunately I cannot find the 14TPI blade.  A 24TPI blade which cuts metal is available and a longer blade for the professional model is available.  Unless replacement blades can be easily located, I am sending the box back and expect to receive full credit.
I will continue to look for a company address and the name of the CEO.
If you know the address please list it for me.",2.0
"the saw started-out working fairly well, but the cuts are no longer perfect.  it seems there's too much play between the blade and the guides, because the cuts are NOT as perfect as they should be.  or, it could be that the blade is too flimsy.
if you're cutting VERY thin wood, you'll be fine.  BUT, if there's any thickness to it, or if it's a hardwood, the cuts will not turn out perfectly.
i'm looking to contact jorgensen about this, but i can't find a website, phone number, or anything . . . any help with contact information would be GREATLY appreciated!",2.0
I have a Kreg pocket hole jig that is about 10 years old. It is solid and very well made. I purchased the new one thinking that it would be a faster tool to use. I was disapointed. It is made of light plastic with steel inserts in thge drill guide holes. The clamp is too light and mot made well. The tool will be in the back of my shop and never used. I think it is over priced. Do not waste your money.,2.0
"I am usually a big fan of Porter-Cable products, but this one is a dud. The fence is clumsy and hard to adjust, the miter gauge slot has substantial slop in it, and ridges in the table are rough and sometimes mark work. I bought it as part of a 3 piece kit - the ""Ultimate Router Workshop."" The cost was less than as a stand alone piece, so I'll probably keep it. If I had purchased it as a stand-alone item, it would be returnsville! If you're serious about owning the PC 1 1/2 hp routers with both bases, purchase them separately and pony up the extra cash for a more refined table. You'll thank yourself later.",2.0
"This unit is made of light weight materials with inexpensive mechanicals that make it difficult to setup.  The fence is hard to use, as it uses a simple L-bracket from the fence to the table with a twist-screw to tighten down - often changing the position as the screw is tightened.  Forget using it without seriously clamping the unit down to some solid surface, as there isn't enough mass to hold it in place.  This said, once set up, the unit works fine and is very portable.",2.0
"I bought this along with a Dewalt three base router kit.  The router does fit the table but requires you to provide your own mounting bolts.  I would give this a higher rating if they would improve the fence system.  As with most router tables of this nature, (for a home work shop), the fence is a split design that requires each side to be adjusted independently.  It can take a while, and lots of trial and error, to get the fence properly set.  There is also a lot of play in the fence that requires you to use a straight edge to ensure that both sides are parallel. There must be a better way.

The miter fence attachment could also use some improvements as well, like easing the ability to attach an extension board for larger workpieces.

The legs and work platform seem adequate for a home workshop and the router mounting bracket works well.

As this is the only table I have every purchased, I do not know if other brands have the same faults.",2.0
"I am a handyman / residential contractor / woodworker. I own several Irwin QuickGrip clamps in various lengths from 10"" to 36"". I use them on occasion but, because other clamps I own I perfer, the Irwins get only light use.

I have found the 12"" size is useful as an ""extra hand"" during the temporary positioning and holding of piece work. For example, the short versions are OK for holding boards down for sawing, or checking clearences in a partially constructed assembly.

But, as a class, I have found these clamps to have weak clamping power. I don't believe they can squeese much more than 40 pounds before the head slips on the smooth rail. The result is I can't use them for two common tasks I have: gluing, or forcing warped items into alignment prior to fastening. These Irwins are just are not strong or reliable enough for those jobs.

Another minor, but troublesome, characteristic of the longer versions of these clamps is this: if you hold the clamp vertically head-down and press the release lever the jaw instantaneously drops open and the head hits the floor -- or your foot. Ouch!

So the short 12"" size gets my luke-warm endorsement (3 stars). I would not repurchase any longer QuickQrip as there are much better clamps available for similar money.",2.0
"If you have limited space, and will be doing small projects from time to time, this is a decent quality table. If you will be doing production work with your router table, I would look elsewhere besides this model. The first thing I noticed, was when I installed my Porter-Cable router into this Porter-Cable table. The 3 retaining screws seemed to have some alignment issues. A little tweaking, and everything finally went together okay, albeit a bit on the tight side. I use my router for free-hand work as well as a table router. I am considering purchasing a 2nd router so I don't have to switch my router in and out, as it is a bit of a hassle. The 2nd thing I noticed, was the the limited fence adjustment capacity. 3 1/2"" - 4"" inches is about all you can expect to get between the 2-piece fence and the center of your bit. Some of my projects require a working depth of 6"" inches or more between the fence and center of bit. By removing the fences, and clamping a straight-edge guide where you need it, 6"" inches can be acheived, but at the loss of the dust collection shroud. Overall, it is a sturdy enough untit when bolted to a solid base. I noticed no deflection in the cast-aluminum table plane as far as straightness goes. Bottom line... fair buy for the price.",2.0
"Thought I was getting a deal when I purchased the 1-1/2 hp P-C plunge router set with table.  You get what you pay for.  No problem with router but the table is VERY sub-standard.  The fence adjustment is LOUSY.  One wing nut holds each sliding fence and is almost impossible to get it square to the working surface due to the slop in the design.  Too much wasted time is spent both aligning the fences to the table and to each other.  The lightweight construction (cheap) allows the table to move around quite a bit when running material thru...be sure to clamp/bolt it down before use.  The miter slot is rough and the slide is sticky.  The only minor positive is the dust chute works adequately when connected to the shop vac.
In hindsight, I should have bought the router alone and looked elsewhere for a quality built piece of equipment.  Now I'm forced to use it until I can build one that is suitable.",2.0
"Although the pictured item is what I ended up getting, I ordered the clamp with the plastic handles (similar to Bessey clamps) - they are easier for me to turn and far less likely to scratch the work.  Those style Pony clamps with vise grip are no longer made, not sure why other than the vendor claimed the mfg said these were 'stronger' - don't need to much strength to pull together quality cabinets...Anyway vendor gave a price reduction, so no issue there, just don't like the clamps in this style - not a good 'new' design!",2.0

Bought it at start of January.  Finally built my router table February 19th. went to put in this plate after i routed out the 1/4 inch rebate.  Couldn't  figure out why the plate wouldn't sit right.

"So to be clear there are at least two version of these clamps by Irwin. They are both light duty and effectively the same size though one is labeled at 4 1/4"" and the other as 6"". It is important to understand the differences as the perform very differently. The 6"" (Irwin Number 530062) has yellow pads, a thinner bar, a slotted handle, and the Irwin stick is on a black plastic ""cover"" piece of the trigger housing. The 4 1/4"" (Irwin Number 1964747) has black pads, a thicker bar, a solid hand, and Irwin sticker in on the blue molded trigger housing. As of writing the review, the description for this product has both Irwin numbers in the text and pictures of both clamps so I'm not sure which comes when ordering (I got sets of both from local hardware store).

While both are labeled as light duty, I would contend that the 6"" (530062) version is not even that. I found that as soon as the clamp made contact the trigger would slip with no where near 35 lbs of pressure (8 different clamps same results) I also found that when try to clamp with these units the black trigger housing would move substantially as the bar would slip. I have no confidence in these clamps holding anything in place beyond the very lightest of jobs. The 4 1/4"" (1964747) version however is a very good light duty clamp that I gave me confidence that the parts would hold together during work. I used them for holding some corner molding in while I glued and nailed them into place.

The labeled 6"" version got returned immediately, but the labeled 4 1/4"" version are staying in my toolbox.

Just make sure you are getting the 4 1/4"" (Irwin Number 1964747) version.",2.0
"I purchased this insert to attached my 3 1/2 hp Milwaukee router for table use.  I spoke directly with the manufacturer with my request for a template to accommodate my router.  I spoke with three people and finally an engineer I spoke with simply stated they did not provide one for my router.  No offer of any kind of assistance.  I had to approximate the layout, using the Milwaukee stock base plate as a guide.  This task is more difficult than you may assume, depth of recess and spacing of the 3 screw holes needs to be exact.  My effort is pretty close, since I had a business associate drill and counter bore the three holes for me at his prototype Lab. Even so, a Rousseau provided template would have been more accurate than using the base plate turned out to be.  I would think that providing one would be very easy for them to produce - even send to a client as an email attachment, with a depth and drill size recommendation.  No customer service focus at Rousseau that I could find.

The different size and color inserts are good, and it works OK as drilled.  My rating is low due to the lack of concerned help and general attitude of the manufacturer.",2.0

"The router plate seems to be pretty decent and the install & setup was easy enough without the additional cost of the optional install template/kit.  But I'm most umhappy with the insert rings.

I usually don't review products but this one is a definite buyer beware.  I don't know if mine was damaged during shipping or while sitting in a pile of this in a box; but the pads are barely staying on the arms.

It works, it is well made, the inserts require a dead-blow hammer to remove and I will not purchase another.",2.0
"I have used this plate for 2 years now and it stinks.  The crown in the plate is ok ... I don't mind that, but the snap in rings are a bear.  You have to use a hammer and hit it hard to snap them in and out.  Last night I was hammering them out and the whole plate shattered.  Now looking at Rousseau's higher quality router lift I find that it has the exact same plastic top and the exact same snap in rings.  Being a weird sized plate means I'm now going to have to re-build the top of my router table to accept a better quality router plate.  Spend the extra cash and get an aluminum plate with quality snap in rings. Also Rousseau's customer service is a nightmare.  This has a lifetime warrantee so I called to get get a free replacement after I broke it.  3 months and numerous phone calls later I FINALLY got a new one from them  ... with the same stupid problem.",2.0
"I frequent a woodworking supply store and look at every table they have. I've never seen a Rousseau setup put together to compare. I just went by the reviews and the claim by the manufacturer. It sounded like a good buy as well as a good idea.

Ok, I've had this base plate for about two years. Actually, it's my second one. I called Rousseau and told them that I think the crown is too high and I think I'm going to have trouble. They told me to route the opening a little lower so that the edges are are a little recessed and then the crown would be parallel to the table or a bit above and it's supposed to work great. They even sent out another plate that less of a crown.
Well, it sort-of works but my stock often catches on the lip of the recessed table. You have to carefully feed the stock along the table and watch for the catch. I've shimmed up the corners, adjusted it every with way and am just completely annoyed with the way the stock rides up the crown and across the other side.
Like one of the other reviewers noted, forget precision work. You need to have a completely smooth top without added variables that make a seemingly simple process a little extra complicated.
If you're cutting plain moulding it works fine. I've cut a ton of bead moulding and coves etc. But forget divided light and anything that has parts that need to be assembled accurately.

I've since purchased an aluminum plate that fits my 9"" x 12"" opening and it works wonderfully. It costs twice as much as this Rousseau but more than makes up for the trouble.",2.0
"I purchased this two years ago.  I actually have two of them.  Part of my purchase was based on positive feedback from the postings below.

Problem:  This plate is NOT flat.  The slight ""crown"" is enough to mess up any precision work.  You cannot do any type of miter work with this plate.  You can forget about rail and stile doors.  Just comes out sloppy and you end up wasting material!

Furthermore, the plate can sag with a ""memory"" effect over time, especially if a heavy router is left on the table.

The rings are a bear to get out and don't leave you with a lot of flexibility for the size of hole you may need.

This is a mediocre product.  It is relatively inexpensive, but will be wasted money if you buy this and get a flat (e.g. al  aluminum) plate later on.  Probably okay for routing that does not involve joinery or a great deal of precision.",2.0

"My company bought one of these many years ago. The first battery and charger lasted for years with no complaints. Eventually i had to get a couple new batteries and they didn't last for more than a couple months. Then the charger stopped charging and only lasted a couple months. I think when they first started making them the batteries and the charger worked good but the quality went south. the company bought me several batteries and 4 chargers.
The screwdriver itself is bullet proof. I now have 4 batteries, 2 non-functioning chargers and two screwdrivers.
I am at odds whether to buy another charger. I've read they have a new charger that goes to trickle when fully charged. It makes me think that the chargers were over charging the batteries and they (the chargers were burning up because one i have is bulging.

"Other than the fact that this product seems to have been constructed in someone's pre-school art class and its lack of versatility and its lack of sensitivity, this is a decent product for the money.

Appearences:

1> The front of this junk box says in overly large letters that this is indeed a 'MOISTURE METER'.  Well, if you did not know that, then you probably are not buying it anyway.

2> The moisture prongs are attached through a household plug's body giving it a grandpa's workbench feel.

Use:

1> the scaled meter bounces so wildly there is little time to determine the actual moisture content of the material you are probing. It might as well just have a red light and a green light to display moist vs. Not moist.

2> It feels lightweight and ready to disintegrate at any moment - certainly not for prolongued or harsh use.

3> On the bright side the corded probe is handy for reaching not so accessible areas.

Overall:

The price is low with good reason. If you are purchasing a water meter than most likely it is needed on the professional level.  this meter dowes not cut the mustard for professional use.  The yellow bound protimeter (preferably with non penetrating and penetrating sensors) is the choice to make.  However, if all you are looking for is a BACKUP moisture meter, then this one fits the task well - at least from your wallet's perspective.",2.0

"The biggest flaw of this clamp is that it utilizes zero leverage in the design. Because of this, the clamp will only be as tight as you can squeeze it with your hands and nothing more. This is in contrast to more effective clamps that maximize clamping pressure by taking advantage of a pistol grip handle 'trigger' or a screw set fastener riding on a lock rail.

Because of this deficiency, items clamped down with these clamps tend to slip and come lose. This is especially true if you don't have the strongest grip to begin with.

This clamp has potential for being used for jobs that require very light clamping pressure, but you will get more bang for your buck by purchasing metal spring clamps.

Overall, I do not recommend this product.",2.0

Same with clamping a metal straight edge on plywood to guide another cut. Finally put some sticky drawer cloth between wood pieces and that helped a lot. I should have put some under the straight edge guide as that started moving while I was cutting, I had to hold the edge guide with a finger as I tried to make my cut. I don't think I should have to use sticky cloth to hold things in place.

"I have several original Quick-Grip Mini bar clamps that I bought in late '90s, early 2000.

"I bought this ladder about 8 to 10 years ago to use in my business.

You can take off the feet at the bottom and pull the sleeves out until you get to the one that has unseated and gotten misaligned, reseat it, which is not always easy, replace all the others above, making sure that each one of them is properly seated, and it will then become useable again for a few more times, if you're lucky.

However, I recently sent this blade out for sharpening, along with the WWII.  I got a call from Forrest asking me ""what's the story on this blade?""  I had no idea what they were talking about.  Long story short, he told me the blade was basically ruined because it was SO out of flat that their head straightener wouldn't even try to get it flat, and if he DID try, he wouldn't guarantee anything.  It sounded to me like he was trying to get me to admit that I ran over it with a truck or abused it in some way.

I had an original workmate for almost 25 years. When I moved a few years ago I gave it to my son who had just purchased his first house. Now 5 years later I really miss that old workmate. So I decided to replace it and purchased a new WM425 from Home Depot. It promised to be everything the old one was and more. WRONG!! What a piece of crap compared to the original. It's built out of stamped metal instead of heavier gauge aluminum and is not at all easy to unfold. The worst feature is the vise action which is not as tight or precise as the original. The 2 handles are joined by a cheap light plastic perforated strap so that both sides tighten (sort of) at the same time. This eliminates the possibility of clamping pieces whose sides aren't parallel. So it's going back to HD and my son and I will be having joint custody of the old Workmate.,2.0

UPDATE Dec 2016
For general light use it is fine but unstable. Also the clamping mechanism is flawed and after a few years fails. I have had to make modifications to the workmate to make it usable because of that. You cannot clamp anything ""really"" solidly - excessive torque will lift the top surfaces and cause even more wobble. Beware this is an amateurs workmate. I use mine mostly as a table or a sawing platform. My bench vise does a better job of holding. had it too long to return it but I wish there was a better one.
The metal framework is flimsy as are the linkages and they all move and cause your work to wobble. STURDY it is not - which is what a unit like this should be.
The top wooden planks slide in slots and the play in those slots is excessive. This causes the whole thing to lift and distort when anything is clamped in the jaws.

"When I first saw this in a local woodworking store, I thought it was a pretty nice table for the money.  Not the ultimate router table, perhaps, but pretty nice.  Not cheap, by any means, but not quite as expensive as some, either.  Certainly a step up from the ""benchtop wonder"" I had been struggling with these past years.  That was in the store.  Then I ordered one for myself.

Now I know why Kreg has such a fetish about gluing all of their packages shut to the point that you just about can't get in them.  They are trying to make sure you will not find out what a nasty surprise they have in store for you until you get home, and to make sure you wreck the package (making returns more difficult) when you do finally open the box.

First was the assembly of the stand, and the attachment of the table top.  There were things I felt that they should not have left for the purchaser to do, but that was not a big deal, and it went together readily enough.

But then came the ""precision fence"".  When I unpacked that box, I was just plain p*ss*d off.  Instead of being assembled, and lacking only attachment to the table and perhaps a little setup, what I found was a box of parts.  Not assemblies to bolt together.  Just parts.  Kreg does not build precision fences.  Kreg sells parts kits for people who would like to build their own precision fence.  Which might be okay, if they said that loud and clear in their marketing materials.  But they don't.  They tell you that you are buying a fence.  Not a box of bits and pieces.

Then, inspired by what I had found, I opened up the box for the Kreg precision miter I had also purchased.  Yes, parts.  Not as bad as the fence, mind you, but still, too many un-assembled parts.

Keep in mind that like most people who would buy this product, I'm not shy about putting things together.  In addition to woodworking, I do machining and metalwork, welding, carpentry, and a lot of electronics fabrication too.  But it really makes me mad to have someone steal my time to increase their profit margins.

But more important than the aggravation, and the lost time, is that instead of a ""precision"" device, assembled by someone with a lot of experience putting it together, and a set of jigs available to make sure everything goes together perfectly, I am going to get something put together by a guy who has never built this item before, has no training, no jigs, and no experience with the product, someone likely to make a mistake or two - me.  So I am NOT getting what I paid for, not even close.  And then I remember that another reviewer mentioned problems with some fragile parts, so I am wondering what that portends for the assembly process.

I haven't built out the fence or the miter yet.  I was so angry I stopped what I was doing to post this preliminary review.  I have a lot of Kreg pocket hole stuff, and while it is a handy product, I never was thrilled with the amount of plastic involved.  It was my intention to make some additional purchases from Kreg, their clamping table, and their beaded face frame system, as well as the lift for my new router table.  But this has me re-thinking my commitment to Kreg as a solution provider.  I can't imagine what kind of DIY nightmare assembling the beaded face frame system might be.

I suppose I will press on with the table.  And I imagine it will be just as nice as it seemed in the store.  But my feeling towards Kreg has changed, and I will not be nearly so quick to buy their products in the future.  Just know that if you buy this table system, you are expected to be the assembly worker before you can enjoy being the owner of this product.

"After having a model built when first introduced (30 years ago or so) finally too broken to repair my second workmate does not compare to the quality of the first model.

Other than that it works well enough.",2.0

"I purchased mine from Lowes. I was not impressed with it from the start. The boards that make up the top are never level with each other. They are made of some kind of Chinese bamboo plywood and two of them sag in the middle. As for clamping...  terrible. It wouldn't hold anything still. The metal frame is made fairly well but I found that mine was twisted and parts were not connected properly. After some tinkering I got most of the kinks out except the sagging top. Still, I wish I had returned it based on my first impression. All you are likely to use this for is a work table and it is a bad one at that.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.",2.0

"...you get a piece of plastic laminate covered fiber board that does not even sit flush with the top of the table saw (it sticks up about 1/32"").  Supposedly this device is supposed to help stabilize the saw blade (especially a thin-kerf blade), reduce chipping and noise.  This may be true, but then it should be a standard feature that comes with the saw rather than the regular insert.  I would skip this and build one yourself for a fraction of the cost.",2.0

"Milwaukee ought to be ashamed of itself! That fact that this essential accessory for a circular saw is not included with the saw is bad enough, but then to be gouged $25 (plus shipping) for fifty cent piece of steel is outrageous. Adding injury to insult is the fact this guide is poorly constructed. As others mention, you will need to do some filing to get it to fit the saw. Why is it that the manufacturers of far cheaper saws manage to include a rip guide? That fits smoothly into the saw.",2.0
"The Short of it:

  If you only have the money for one tool, skip this one and purchase the Stanley Fatmax. It comes in two sizes, and is a much better made tool for similar money.

  The Long of it:

  The finish on the Tweaker identifies it's ""Made in Taiwan"" construction (i.e. poor); and, as pointed out by others, the inner claw is too small to obtain a firm grip if you have a really stubborn board to deal with. I do like the apparent ability for this tool to be hammered into tight places for prying; and the ""handle"" would lend itself well to extension with a piece of metal pipe for some real prying assistance.

  However, I am not sure of the quality of the metal, so any ""assistance"" applied as I indicated above (i.e. hammering, or using a pipe for an extended handle) is at your discretion. I find that any tool ""Made in Taiwan"" seldom stands up to 'normal' use, let alone going above and beyond.

  The Bottom line:

  The Fatmax is able to handle thicker stock, for the heavier joists and such. It is a much more finished tool, and I would not be too worried to add a little ""assistance"" to it to get a job done.
  If you have the money to purchase several tools, there are some functions that this tool may perform better then the Fatmax, so go ahead and get one. I did. Nice idea, but I think I would have skipped it if I had seen it close-up before I bought it.",2.0
"It surprised me that my new Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw didn't come with a rip fence.  I mean, every carpenter needs this essential accessory.  But I guess this all goes to achieving the right price point to be competitive.  So I ordered the only rip fence Milwaukee offers for this saw.  The calibration markings are pretty good, it is strong enough, and the range of extension (how large a rip you can make) is about average.  The annoying thing is that it doens't fit very well.  When you tighten the thumb screw to secure it in position for a specific size rip, three things happen.  The action of the thumb screw against the calibrated shaft causes the adjustment to change slightly as you tighten it, so you always have to double check visually and do a check-cut before starting the rip.  Most carpenters will do this as a matter of course.  But the thumb screw also leaves little dimples in the shaft that make repeated adjustments of the same or similar size somewhat difficult because the tip of the thumb screw tries to home in on previous dimples.  And third, the calibrated shaft cocks slightly, so the guide (that short part of the ""T"" that rides against the wood) isn't level, but at an angle of about ten to fifteen degrees.  Depending on how you support the work piece, this angled guide can get caught and trip up your cut.  The circular saw itself is such a fine piece of equipment that this misfitting accessory is very disappointing.  Milwaukee ought to fix this; it ain't rocket science.  Nonetheless, with a lot of care, you can make it work.",2.0
"I had the same experience as G. Mealhouse. It is too wide for the slot on my Milwaukee circular saw. The problem seems to be that the metal-stamping process left several little 'nubs' of metal along the edge. I will have to file them off.

Until I can do that, though, I forced the thing into the slot (skinning a knuckle in the process) and used it, and it does the job nicely so long as you don't want to rip anything wider than six inches. The measurements on the scale are accurate. I'm sure I'll be happy with it once I can modify it to fit properly.

Update Dec. 2009: I finally got around to filing off those 'nubs' and now it does a good job. Still a little too snug in the slot but usable and very useful.",2.0
"I have been using this thing for almost a year. Well, most of the negative reviews are actually true. The most important parts are made of cheap and flimsy plastic, such as the holds on the back of the panels, the vice handles and the connecting belt between the handles. The bamboo laminated panels are hard enough but they are thin and badly warped, so you will never get a level working surface. The vice mechanism and the grabbing surfaces are too small to keep even a small piece of wood in place for hand work like planing not to mention power tools - that can be outright dangerous. The working plates would move around all the time unless all three of them are clasped together tightly, but even then I would not recommend using a router on it. Do not fool yourself into thinking you are buying a workbench -- it is pretty much a nice looking toy. I am gradually refitting it replacing the plastic parts and the bolts but that takes time and more money.",2.0
"I am a former Union construction guy, and I have done some demo in my day. This hammer while easy to use is  shall we say gutless, I mean this thing has no power.

But it is easier to use and much better inside for light work",2.0
"If you have been using cheap orbital sanders, the Fein will be a big improvement.  For about four years, I have been using the Festool 6"" Rotex 150 but it goes through motor brushes about every year.  So, I thought a change was in order.  I bought the Fein sander hoping not only to solve the motor brush problem but maybe improve over the Festool.  There is absolutely no comparison.  The Festool is a far better sander.

  Controling the Fein is difficult at best.  When sanding narrow pieces like a cabinet face frame, the Fein jumps around.  When sanding larger areas, the Fein sucks down onto the work piece making it more difficult to move.  Long periods of sanding with the Fein are a struggle.  The Fein is aggresive but, when you want less agressive sanding, you don't have a choice since it is only one speed not variable.  I am especially disappointed in the amount of vibration the Fein has.  The worse thing of all is the poor quality when sanding with high grit paper for the final pass.  One other downer is the high cost and lack of availability of sand paper for the Fein.  And if all that isn't enough, I emailed Fein regarding problems trying to register my sander online for the extra 2 year warranty.  I never heard from them.  By the way, I spoke with a Fein representative prior to buying the sander and told him I already have a Festool.  He said Fein is the best.  So much for honest salesmanship.

 If you don't want the above problems, go with Festool.  The motor brush problem is the only down side and that might just be a problem with the one I have.  Other people have told me they have never changed motor brushes in their Festool sander.  The price is about the same on both sanders.",2.0
"Bought new, very disappointed.  Cheap piece of crap:
- Wooden top is warped and splintery
- Some structural pieces are made of plastic and intended to accept threaded metal bolt.  Strip easily as others have noted.
- Stamped metal frame with sharp edges.  Like others, I wouldn't consider putting 500 pounds on this
- Instructions are wrong -- don't even include the correct parts list, much less complete assembly instructions.  Instructions differ from the actual product in significant ways and were missing instructions for some parts

Update -- went to the B&D website, did some looking around for manuals, and confirmed that the instructions were wrong.  Get the instructions for Workmate 425 *Type 6*.

Called B&D support and got a customer support person who didn't know the product, but she was able to look at the instructions and took my list of needed parts (including replacement for warped wood piece) and maybe I'll get replacements in a week.

"I've had my BO5010 for three years, and it hasn't seen a lot of work -- just handyman stuff every few months. Until now, it has been pretty useful, though the dust collection bag is poorly designed.

Yesterday in the middle of a job the sanding disc kept flying off. The rubber sanding pad on the base provides the hooks for the hook-and-loop system, and that pad somehow lost its hookiness. No new pad will stick to it.

I don't know what caused this: I was using a light touch, and my sanding disc storage organizer uses pegs to ensure the disc's holes line up with those in the pad. Whatever the cause, I now have to order a replacement pad which is nearly one-third the cost of a new sander and may take a week or more for delivery. I'm not sure whether I'd be throwing good money after bad -- I might be better off buying a brand new sander by a different manufacturer.

"The shipping box that it came in was in bad shape. Like other reviews, my wm425 was missing a part - one of the plastic frame guards. The wm425 is sturdy and stable although it does have some shortcomings. The three wood table tops are too thin (5/8) cheap plywood and mine were warped. They should be at least 3/4 inch plywood. The nylon belt drive and plastic hubs slip and the belt skips often which wears out the belt and drive hubs. When tightening the crank assembly to hold wood pieces for work the front sliding clamp table top tends to move up off of its side supports - its really a bad design. The plastic spacers that are bolted to the three wood  tables are poorly designed - they wear easily and have too much up/down play. The right angle side support which is welded to the frame is too thin and mine was not level - it was warped and required bending to get the table top surfaces flat.

On the plus side, wm425 folds easily and is easy to store - it doesn't take up much space in my garage. If you can live with its shortcomings and are very careful when tightening the clamp its a handy tool. The only reason I'm not returning mine is that with some metal and wood work I can see how I can improve the problem areas I mentioned. With the improvements I have in mind it should serve well for a long time.",2.0

Don't think it would hold up to lots of construction/carpentry work. Very disappointed.",2.0
"I ordered mine online from Amazon and had no problem with shipping and packaging. The overall design is good and the collapsable frame is well made. However, the top work surface on the table that I received is not flat, does not fit properly, nor does it provide a stable work surface. In addition to the three sections of the top not fitting together, the attachments that hold the top sections to both the fixed section and moveable sections of the frame are cheaply made and do not hold firmly which leaves the clamping mechanisms useless.  In order to use the product now I have to lay a piece of plywood over the two usable top pieces. Eventually, I plan to remanufacture a more substantial top with proper fasteners and regain the useful clamp feature.

"A) The instructions were vague and part descriptions were inconsistent. For example, one is instructed to install two more ""top blocks"" than are supplied. This is an error in wording. Per the parts list these last two should have been referred to as ""Front Blocks."" The instructions end before describing how to place two of the three ""Jaws"" that make up the top surface of the bench. Apparently there are multiple configurations that could be used.

B) The overall quality was poor. it would be very easy to strip the screws or break the plastic parts that are user installed. Another two parts were broken before I was finished: (1) the flimsy perforated strap that is intended to keep the two screws tightening in parallel was 95% torn and (2) at one point a spring came flying off from somewhere. All of the lateral springs are both there so somewhere there is an unpaired spring. finally, the three leaves of the table top are not co-planer, so it's not a good spot for a glue up.

C) It might hold 550 pounds of dead weight (as advertised on the box) but the mechanism will never apply that much pressure through the vise. The bench dogs can only hold a modest amount of pressure before they come flying out.

This was intended to be a substitute for a workbench until a better one could be built. It will also serve as incentive to finish the better, proper workbench.",2.0

My friend is a process engineer and writes complex instruction manuals for a living. he could not believe that any quality control was asserted during the writing of the manual!

On to the nitty gritty:
 So, After we discovered that the belt-drive that makes the handles turn together was mis-aligned, we set to fixing that first. once that was done, we got all the boards on top. None of them lined up well. The cranks to tighten the work clamps are not going to last because they are cheap plastic ""snap-ons"". The belt skips constantly, and is cheap plastic.

"I needed a workbench in a pinch as I hadn't built mine yet and this received adequate reviews. After a couple months of using it, I should've waited. Putting it together wasn't too bad. The only tricky part was the the ""vise"" where it was tough to get the plastic lined up with the gear shaft. It's hard to clamp things to it because of all the over hanging metal. You can't clamp things to two entire sides because something gets in the way. It seems sturdy but at certain angles it's tippy. For example, on the box cover, there is a picture of a door being held by the table. For kicks, I tried this with a door sitting in my basement and it immediately fell over. I tried it with a 2x2 birch plywood and the same thing while it didn't fall over, a very small bit of pressure on the end (where, for example, I'd want to route the edge) made it tippy. There's no way I'd want to do any power tool work on this as I just don't trust it to stay stable. Nevermind getting a clean cut -- I'm talking about cutting myself.

The bench dogs work well but only for limited size pieces. I guess if you're a model builder you'll be OK, but anything bigger than a jewelry box will have issues with it. It's also too small to use as a sit down bench. It has worked well as a small outfeed table for my table saw but for that I could've just used a sawhorse. Bottom line is take the $90 you'd spend on this, buy yourself some wood, and build something bigger, better, and more stable than this thing. If you don't want to do that, buy yourself a small kitchen cabinet and screw a top onto it. You'll have a much more stable and functional work surface.",2.0

BTW, if you go to the shark website, and read their PDF on their incredible hand-finished tools, the exact things that are missing are the ""V-blade"" in the cat's paw they claim grabs the nail.  It's closer to a pinched U now.",2.0

"I have had this hammer one month and use it every weekend on a garage rehab project. I find the leather handle slippery. There is no stickiness to it and when I swing it wearing my leather work gloves the hammer will fly out of my hands. I am worried that I may hit my friend who is helping me on this project.

I like the feel and balance of the hammer but the leather wrapped handle is just not working for me.  I plan to continue to use the hammer with the hope that in time the leather wrap will soften and become tacky.  I purchased another hammer last week with a rubber handle which I use now more than this hammer.",2.0

"Folks, this is a poorly made Mexican made knockoff of what was once a decent block plane.  The ""precision grind"" on the base was so rough..well, it felt like 60 grit sandpaper..really.  I used $6 or $7 worth of sandpaper to try to smooth it out and it isn't nearly smooth yet.  I expected to have to touch up the iron, but really..this iron had a burr turned over on the edge..minor I suppose..it would sharpen.  Come on Stanley..your name used to mean something.  The Stanley name, by the way looks like it was stamped on with a rubber stamp and is so blurred it can barely be read.  Intentionally?
  If you want a plane to throw in the bottom of your tool box and take out now and then to knock down a sharp edge, save yourself $15 and buy one of those stamped metal throw away things.  If you want a tool you won't mind your buddies seeing, don't buy this one.  Pretty much junk.",2.0

I HAVE JUST GOTEN AROUND TO TRYING TO ASSEMBLE THE PRODUCT-ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS ARE VAGUE AND NOT CLEAR BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM I HAVE IS SOME PARTS SHOWN ON THE INCLUDED PARTS LISTS ARE MISSING SO I CAN NOT ASSEMBLE THE PRODUCT AT THIS TIME,2.0
"I just finished putting this together.  Once I was able to parse the sparsely-detailed instructions, it went together fairly quickly, with no 'extra' parts remaining.  That's a plus.

 However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the materials used to construct this product, and the overall design. With the exception of six bolts, the bench is held together with plastic fasteners that will lose integrity in a relatively short time-span, especially under heavy use. Cheap metal, particle board and plastic are poor choices for workbench fabrication.  Personally, I wouldn't trust anything weighing anywhere near 500 pounds sitting on this bench. I really don't expect that it will last long.

 On hindsight, the money would have been better spent on quality lumber and hardware.",2.0

"I purchased this tool for a job where I had to hang 12 doors, all flush solid core stain grade maple, valued at $350.00 each. Throw in the cost of the custom made maple jambs, mistakes were just not an option on the hinge mortises. This tool disappointed me right away. Once you've interpreted and applied the somewhat vague instructions, set-up is relatively simple. The problem I had was that the template sections moved when I transfered the jig from the door to the jamb. Most times, the sections moved only slightly so it wasn't noticeable until after the mortises were routed and the door was getting hung. By then, too late, break out the maple colored putty and stand by for customer complaints. Hand tightening the supplied thumbscrews would not hold the sections reliably, and when I applied slightly more than hand tight pressure with a pair of channel locks, the bolts stripped and broke every time.  I finally bored out the threaded holes and replaced the thumb screw set-up with 1/4"" machine bolts with a nut and washer. This modification makes for a very time consuming set-up, but at least it would hold the sections tight. All in all, Porter Cable has a ways to go on this tool to make it an every day reliable jig for use by a professional installer. It could be improved upon considerably. I'll keep it for occasional cautious use, but it's not really worth the price I paid.",2.0
"This template kit is roughly made. Not easy to keep set up for any length of time (screws loosen). Can be a knuckle scraper. Problem setting the center template the same for the flip flop on the jamb.
I would expect a tool of this type would be made of extruded Aluminum for better accuracy of measurment. I would pay more for such a tool. The price equals the quality on this one.
I have been a carpenter for 35 years, hinged a lot of doors in that time. Pre-hung doors are the choice of course, but sometimes you have to do them on site. This tool wouldn't be my first choice.",2.0

"As others have commented - I can't believe the problems has still not been addressed - my flimsy package arrived in shreds with the workbench damaged.  Amazon promptly replaced it.  Assembling the unit is simple, especially if you ignore the somewhat obtuse instructions, but the tool supplied for tightening the bolts is best replaced with a socket wrench as the bolts were nearly impossible to tighten with the supplied tool.

"I recently purchased my second Workmate to backup my first and as an nice addition to my project/handyman tools.

When I purchased my second one I wanted the very same one as my first which is about 18-20 years old and I have used it so much it looks like it has been through several wars, beat up but still works great. My old workmate is my favorite tool that I can not be without, it has stood the test of time and weathered the sometimes abuse I give it which is almost daily. I choose the 425 Workmate which is supposed to be the more heavy duty of the models and carries the same 550 lb. rating as my old one. After assembling the New Workmate I could tell it looks nearly the same as my old one but not as rugged or sturdy. Black and Decker had a very great product when they made my first one but now the frame is of thinner metal, the top working surface is allot thinner and slightly warped, the new design is good with added features but it looks and feels when working with it like a cheap nock off from the original. I was very disappointed that it has been cheapened by cost cutting measures even though the newer features are good. I would have gladly paid a little more than I did on Amazon to have had the quality of my old one with out the newer features. For those people who have never owned one of the older models and don't know how they were built before, this one would probably suit their needs. Black and Decker had a very excellent high quality product in the older model only to cut back on materials and make an average to poor quality product, it is very disappointing to see that happen. Although this is a very handy tool to have and most people will love to work with one, B&D missed the mark by making it lighter and of much lesser quality than they once had.",2.0
"As others have said, this block plane is not shipped in a form that is usable. Mine came with a very rough concave sole (as though someone without much skill flattened it with a 10-inch 20-grit drum sander), the mouth was so poorly made that the blade would not descend beyond the sole, and the movable gate needed some work.

Here is what I did to get a descent plane:
1) Using a plate glass & sandpaper lap, I flattened the sole. 100 and 150 grit did the trick. Took 3 hours.
2) With a mill file I worked the mouth so that the blade would sit down properly and protrude below the sole. This meant removing a bump and some material where the blade rests just back of the opening. The blade, because it is thin, still flexes a bit when clamped and rises up, so there is still a little work I need to do. About 30 minutes of effort...so far. I think this is the most important modification I've had to do.
3) The sliding gate fore of the mouth needed some file work to smooth its trailing edge; it appears to have been sheared. Five minutes was enough here.
4) Honed the blade, but that is a requirement for all planes.

The plane seems pretty good now. I'm still working to find the right tension on the clamp; too little and it moves during use, shifting the blade laterally and altering the cut; too much and the vertical adjustment screw turns only with much force.

So, as a kit for a plane, 4 stars. As a ready-to-use plane, 0 stars. I gave it the average of the two.",2.0
"The reviews were mixed on this item, there were more positives than negatives so I decided to give it a try. The first thing I discovered was than the plane was made in Mexico. Just like other brand name tools, Stanley has taken their manufacturing of what used to be quality tools to foreign countries. No OHSA, no EPA, no vacation, no overtime pay, no employee benefits of any kind, just long hours until you drop dead and there is always someone waiting to take your place. SHAME ON YOU STANLEY! There are just as many Mexicans in the U.S. as there are in Mexico so they didn't have to move there. Now for the tool,...like others who expected a little quality in the tool, I found none. I fully expected to have to lap the sole of the plane, you have to do that with any new or vintage plane. It took a good hour of lapping to get the sole reasonably flat. The blade of course had to be honed as well. Upon reassembly I discovered that the blade does NOT extent below the mouth of the tool unless the mouth adjustment is set so the mouth is fully extended. Close it up just half way and the cutter jams against the mouth. So my question to Stanley is why is there an adjustable mouth when it is totally useless? With the mouth fully opened up you can extend the blade to take a fine shaving, provided you have flattened the sole and honed the blade. The lateral adjustment is a joke as well. I had already flattened the soul and honed the blade before discovering the flaw with the mouth so I can't return it. My advise is buy a good vintage plane or one of the higher end planes unless you wanted to drop $40.00 bucks for a paper weight.",2.0
"As a hobbiest woodworker I enjoy trying out all the new gadgets.  Of late I've begun to shun some of my power tools in favor of more traditional hand-powered tools and have discovered I feel more like a woodworker than a machinest when using hand tools.  Don't misunderstand, that's just me and NOT a negative comment about power tools and those who prefer them.

Coming from a Good American Company with a fabulous reputation, this little block plane is quite a disapointment.  No hand plane comes ready to use out of the but this one wasn't even in the ball park.  The iron was dull and the sole was out of flat in both dimensions.  A lengthy (for a new plane) tuning had most of the discrepancies resolved, but the lever assembly refuses to remain tight when in use.

I would not recommend this product.",2.0
"not as well built as the older ones, the lock lever bent within the first few uses.",2.0
"Unfortunately - or fortunately - I own several Veritas bevel-up low angle planes, including the $139 'standard' low angle block plane about the same size as this one.
Compare the two of them, and if the Veritas is 5-stars - this is 2 stars at most.

The sole was extremely rough and concave - an hour of lapping starting with 80 grit only got the 'key areas' around the nose, toe, and throat area lapped. Much of the area behind the blade is still untouched. The adjustable nose plate was the roughest - right at the edge in front of the blade was worst. Exactly where you don't want it to be rough. Still mill marks there after an hour.

The plane was 'assembled in Mexico from international components' - nothing on any of the parts except the blade indicated where they were from. The blade was stamped 'Made in England' and doesn't look bad actually - its well machined and finished for an 'out of the box (rather bubble) blade - but I have no idea of how hard it is, and thus edge retention, at this point.

I titled 'rating depends on use' - and if you are looking for a block plane simply to knock of edges, or perhaps a small area of end grain, in say softwood - you might rate this a 4-star as others have. But if you are thinking of changing the bevel angle from 25 to say 38 - trying to make a miniature smoother - lots of luck.

If you plan to use this for hardwood cabinet-making etc. - save up for the Veritas. In this case, 'the cheapest tool is the most expensive' probably applies here.

Edit 02/25/2010 One reason my experience was less favorable than others with earlier-dated reports likely is: Previously the plane was assembled/made in England. Now, as mentioned above, the plane is 'assembled in Mexico from international components'. According to several reports elsewhere, this move resulted in a big drop in quality and consistency compared to the English version.",2.0

Two stars only because there is one part that gets stuck every time I try to use it. This idea is great and helps when you are doing stairs but this one part that slides out when finding the stringer angle gets stuck so you need to force it back and forth to be able to use it and look for the stringer angle AGAIN because of the sliding part flaw.

"This is an item that I have been patiently waiting to purchase until now, when we reached the point in our remodeling project that would benefit from the ability to lift and hold sheet stock for installation. After a great deal of research, I decided to purchase a model and manufacturers lift that is considerably more expensive than many others on the market. Additionally, I liked the idea of ""Made in America"". This was in great part a reason for my decision to purchase this particular machine.

I was very disappointed with the assembly quality and attention to fit and finish put forth by the manufacturer of this product. I unpacked, assembled, and tested the unit. It immediately went back in the box for returned.

There were two main problems with the unit I received. Mechanically, the cross-arm that mounts atop the vertical mast did not set level. Understandably, the unit is designed with play at this point to allow for a certain amount of ""self-leveling"" to occur, causing the sheet stock to rest fully against the surface to which it is being applied. In the case of the unit I received, the pin mechanism which is part of the cross-arm had been poorly stamped, then welded out of square. When inserted into the vertical mast the mis-assembly completely defeated the lifts ability to ""self-level"". When raised, with the cross-arm was positioned tightly against a sheet. One end of the arm would rest against the sheet while the opposing end lacked contacting the sheet by almost 3 inches. This flaw was accentuated when attempting to support a 16' sheet.

Secondly, and this is a cosmetic consideration, the unit came out of the box from the factory, completely scarred and scraped. My first thought was that a certain amount of damage occurred during shipment. However, upon closer examination it was evident that the unit was packaged in this condition. The last straw came when I looked at the ""Made in America"" flag sticker proudly positioned at the top front of the mast, right over the most offensive scrape, completely through the paint, from one end of the mast to the other. The sticker was in pristine condition. Yes, it had been proudly applied by the team member(s) in the factory, right over the poorly assembled and even more carelessly handled equipment. There was also numerous scars elsewhere on the machine due to poor padding and packaging. The unit chewed itself during shipment.

This is not what I expected from a machine selling at this price point. As I repackaged the unit for return shipment, I couldn't help but think to myself, ""This is what I was hoping to avoid by not purchasing one of the many other `Made in China' units that are available on the market."".

With the purchase of the additional extension for the mast, this unit was priced at almost $1,000.00 including shipping. Understand, I had considered the price point prior to purchase, and decided that it would be a good investment, a quality machine, providing many years of service.

This unit is definitely not worth the purchase price being asked. Consider one of the far cheaper machines. At least you'll know what to expect when you open the box.",2.0
"The ""case"" as advertized is a tube made of flimsy plastic of 1.25mm thickness, with caps
at each end. It looks to me the ""case"" is a disposable shipping packaging rather than permanent
storage. If the tool is so elegant as many reviewers said, why doesn't it have a equally elegant case
to match it. Judging from the good reviews, and the price ($139.90), and that the case is specifically
advertized (but there was no picture), I was expecting a case of equal as or better than the
quality of the case of my $20 caliper, with which I am pretty happy.

Where would you store a tube with rolling around? And I doubt that carrying a tube to customer side
would boost your professional image. Imagine that a musician carry his flute in a plastic tube
to the concert hall! Sure, a good case will increase the cost, but given the low
material cost of the tool, which I estimate as $20 or less, as it is just a few pieces of wood and
some plastic and metal parts, there are plenty of room for the case. I for one will pay for the
design and workmanship, and casing is part of it. ""Including case"" is one of the reason I decided
to buy the product.

So much for the casing. Now the two adjustable stops that you can set for the depth of ""nose"" that
overhangs the riser. As one review well said, ""It's important to make sure that both of these stops
are set EXACTLY the same distance from the butting edge of the tool or it will throw your cut lines
off significantly"". But how do you make sure the same distance? Yes you can measure it with another
tool such as a caliper, but if this tool is well thought of as many reviewers claimed, why there
are no measurement markings on the set of stops themselves? Even if this is thought of, it would
not be possible as the stops are plastic. Why don't use more durable metals with clear and more
accurate measure markings?

And for the non-adjustable stops, the standard wood screw is used directly threaded into the wood.

Does the tool works, Yes! But a cheaper tool or a hand made tool also works. The width of the tread
and the riser are important, but the depth of the tread and height of the riser are not as they are
hidden under the riser and behind the nose respectively.

But just as a smart phone, it is not judged by weather it can be used to make a phone call, it is
the cool factor. If this is a $50 tool, then I would have no problem. But it is a $140 tool, then
I have high expectations. With this price which is about 10 times of the material cost, there is no
reason to cut corners as what was done: not providing a real case, many plastic parts instead of durable
metals, standard wood screws directly threaded on the wood. In summary, if you expect something that
works, yes, it does the job, but a perfect piece of art, no.",2.0

"I bought 4 set of these jacks [8 jack, pole anchors, gaurd rails and braces] for my construction company.

Boy was I wrong.  It took 4 men 2.5 days to set up the poles adding that to the lumber required to install the jacks, railing, planks, and safety barior and I would have been better off buying the aluminum jacks.

As for actually using the jacks, the system does not feel very secure even when installed per manufacturers recomendations.  The whole set up sways.

I give this product 2 stars becuase when in use you can get the job done but otherwise its a waste of time and money.",2.0

I've experimented with them and found out that on one pump jack, I had to make sure the crank used to lower the jack must be pushed into the square hole as per instructions, while the other pump jack didn't work this way. It didn't matter if The crank was in the square hole or not. And then when I wanted to raise the jack again, I had to use a hammer to knock the crank back out of the square hole since it wouldn't budge no matter what I did. I also STRONGLY recommend using braces every 10 feet of pole height to give the setup more horizontal stability.",2.0

"The cord works, however, the wire is not identified on the insulation -- most importantly the gauge size.  (""AWG 14/3,"" that sort of identification). This information is typically embossed on the insulation, repeatedly, over the length of the wire.  On this cord, there's nothing.
This cord has two flimsy stick-on labels, but once they wear off, which they will, there remains no indication of wire size.  Actually, even the stick-on labels do not state the wire size.

"I bought one, used it  and returned it. Yeah it is accurate, but do I need to know a right angle is not an exact 90*? Maybe it is 89.4*. And if it is, you cannot set your typical miter saw to cut that minus .4* accurately enough anyway. So your cut will not be exactly the same as the angle the Bosch Miter Finder displays on the screen. Finding the angles or stairway spindles and handrails can be done just as easy with an inexpensive angle finder or a scrap piece of wood, pencil and level. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful tool. But if I would have kept it, it would have sat in my tool box most of the time. If you do enough trim work, you'll rely more on your site and experience rather than a tool that gives you the exact angle of a cut to the fraction or decimal which cannot be achieved on most saws.",2.0

"I bought 2 of these compressors - one for me and one for my son.  Each of our compressors has failed in the identical fashion, his multiple times.  I think the basic compressor, i.e. the electric motor and vane compressor, is quite solid, but the control circuit which turns the motor on and off is quite cheesy and prone to failure.  It is also *very* expensive to replace.

Since this has happened to us a total of 3 times now, this is not just a case of random failure, but is a systematic problem.  A shame, too, because the rest of the tool seems quite robust.  We are shopping for new compressors now.  I can tell you one thing - they won't be Hitachi.",2.0

There is nothing wrong with them being pastic but if you transport your compressor regularly in the back of your truck, then you can count of them breaking almost everytime and the compressor stops working soon after that. If your compressor stays in your garage then this is okay. But for twice the money, you can buy a thomas compressor that has more power, is a lot less noisy, and a much better machine.",2.0
"What would have been a great compressor (aside from regulator placement) is spoilt for me by 2 things:  1) for about $1.50 a muffler could have been put on to reduce noise by 25-30 dB (to less than 1/4?) and 2) the unloader valve that is supposed to relieve pressure from the cylinder head after the compressor cycles off is poorly designed. When it fails, the motor has to try & start with the head under pressure, which mostly it cannot do. This is also likely to burn out the motor. This same thing may also be the cause of all the poor starting in cold weather etc. I have a simple fix. If you (or Hitachi Co.) want it, email paul@pthompson.com  I have since bought 2 Makita 3.5hp compressors, and now having fixed this I shall probably sell it.",2.0

"I've feel deceived.  The product I received is not the same as the one pictured.  The one pictured is what I wanted because of the superior design.
Notice the red button on the handle which locks the blade in place.  It's flush with the handle its self.  The saw they sent me has a large bulging wing nut knob.  It bulges a little on one side but bulges a lot on the other side as it has a large plastic wing nut which makes it harder to saw in tight places flush against surfaces.

Going to contact the company and see what they have to say about it.",2.0

"I originally purchased the SD208 one year ago (May 2013). It came loose and destroyed all the blades and chippers. The arbor bore of the inside blade was apparently too small, and it worked itself free. Freud replaced it with another SD208. A few months ago it again slipped apparently due to the inexactness of the arbor size. Two chippers each lost one cutting head and the outside blade also lost one tooth. I need a new dado set, but I hesitate to try Freud again. Perhaps this model has some manufacturing problems. I did note that some other reviewers have referred to an arbor size problem.",2.0
"The dado set came with three 1/16-inch spacers and every one was coated with a heavy layer of rust.  No shims were included with the set, though the description says they are included.  Two stars because of rusted spacers and no shims!",2.0
"After reading all of the reviews here I bought the 2700XL for my Makita 2703.  I thought that it would be an improvement with regard to the fence and add some much needed table space.  I realize in retrospect that I should have just sold the 2703 and bought a new saw.  Here are the issues:

Fighting with the nylon mounts - Rather than attach to your table saw in any stable fashion it is designed so that your  saw rests on nylon ring mounts.  These are extremely frustrating to get set up properly for a tight fit.  As you screw in the bolts (from underneath the table) the rings invariably move throwing you out of square.  Right off the top of my head I can think of a half dozen ways this could have been done better.  Poorly done.

Even more poorly done - what I would call a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW: there is absolutely no way to level the 2700XL to your table saw.  After I was done fighting with the nylon mounts I was horrified to find that the 2700XL table sat a good 1/16"" below my saw bed.  Try moving the fence across and ""clank!""  Its a ""no go.""  What's worse - apparently not anticipating this, Rousseau incorporates exactly ZERO ways to adjust the height of the table or saw to correct for it.  I was able to get around this eventually by unscrewing the 2700XL table and inserting washers underneath.  Again, I can easily think of several ways to prevent this - for example, mounting the table on adjustable thumbscrews.  Makes you wonder what they are paying their engineers for (?!?)

Poor instructions - Although it was not mentioned in the relatively meager instructions, there are hex nuts that you can adjust to square the fence that are hidden on the inside of the fence.  It took me a few weeks to figure that one out.  Perhaps if I was a table saw pro I would have known that but why not include it in the instructions guys...why?

One positive thing I can say about this product is that it seems sturdy when the legs are unfolded.  Also, once set up correctly the fence seems pretty accurate.  This is NOT, I repeat, NOT a portable solution.  Heavy and no wheels.  Very unwieldy to move around and no wheeled base is available.

In the final analysis, I am not sure why anyone would buy this rather than just get a better saw in the first place.  The onyl reason I could think of would be to have a bigger table stand at home and be able to pick up the saw and go with it...I would just have two saws.  For me this was throwing good money after bad.",2.0
"This table is a delight.  The cutting accuracy is incredible. Having recently retired, I'm catching up on 30 plus years of ""honey-do's"", including house remodeling.  The large table space and the ease of operation are features not found on other saws I've owned. The portability is a major plus. Highly recommended.",2.0
"First off I bought this for some cross cut 1""x1"" notches in soft wood, I have seen better cuts performed with a chain saw. Probably one of the worst preforming dado sets I have used. Including the 6"" $20 cheapo set I have. Part of the problem may be the rake angle of the teeth, little or none, this might have been fine for some other application but not mine. It may not be obvious from the description but this set is of an odd design, the chipper teeth are very wide and then to achieve your desired width you almost always use the spacers. This seems to me like a way of saving money since they only have to have 3 chippers this way, if this blade made good cuts it would be a minor annoyance just because it is different from a normal dado were you just stack the appropriate chippers instead of having to mess with shims every time.",2.0
"I bought this Dado set on line from a woodworking supply outlet and when i recieved it i went to install it in my Dewalt DW744 contractor table saw. My saw has a 5/8`` arbour but European blades have a 30mm or 1-1/4`` bore, Dewalt overcomes this by supplying an outside blade washer with a 30mm protrusion which locks into the blade bore. I had two options when i bought this Dado set, i could have bought one with a 5/8'' bore or a 30mm bore. As all my table saw blades have a 30mm bore i assumed the Dado with the 30mm bore would fit my saw. Sadly it didn`t, the two outside blades went on fine but when i tried to install some chippers between them they just sat down on the blade arbour. The outside blade washer`s protrusion isn`t long enough to support the chippers, obviously i didn`t try to turn on the saw with this configuration. In my own defence this was my first Dado set so my knowledge of them is limited. Freud makes some assumptions with the instructions on this set, i just don't understand how a saw with a 5/8'' arbour can be fitted with a Dado set with a 30mm bore. I can't speak for other saws that are manufactured for the European market but i'm fairly sure that they all have 5/8'' arbours with outside blade washers with 30mm protrusions. Unless Freud are selling adaptors with a 5/8'' bore with a 30mm outside diameter, i don't understand why they are selling the 30mm bore Dado sets. This problem won't be an issue for Americans or Canadians as 5/8'' bore tablesaw blades and Dado sets are standard in those countries.

I had read the reviews of this product on Amazon and noticed that a lot of people have problems with fitting this set to their saws. I tried to install the inside blade, all the chippers and the outside blade. There just isn't enough room on the arbour, the only way i could get them to fit was to remove the inside blade washer. The inside blade washer is big, it takes up about 3/8'' on the arbour. Dewalt might have a slimmer inside blade washer on the market. With the entire Dado set on the arbour i tried turning the set by hand and noticed that the inside blade was rubbing against the blade shield. Obviously the inside washer should not be removed, a fairly slim inside washer is a must for this Dado set on a Dewalt DW744. I'll have to spend money on returning the Dado set and swapping it for the set with the 5/8'' bore. I'm sure this is a fine Dado set once it's compatible with your saw, Freud should include a list of compatible saws with the instructions. Colour coding the shims and chippers would be a great idea as well.

I'm updating the above, i went to my local Dewalt service centre and the technican told me that i'd have to buy seven 30mm to 15mm reducers or send the Dado set back which would cost me nearly as much in postage as the seven reducers. I bought the reducers, this still leaves the issue of the shims being unsupported on the arbour shaft because of their 30mm bores. I'll probably have to buy a set of shims with 15mm bores which will cost me more money. He said that Dewalt don't have a slim inside blade washer so i'll have to get it reduced in thickness in a machine shop if i want to get the full stack on the arbour. I'll have to turn the outside blade washer around so that the 30mm protrusion is on the outside against the lock nut. Sounds simple enough doesn't it!

I ended up sending back the dado set and had it replaced with one with a 15mm bore, i also got a refund for the seven reducers i bought. I tried to fit the entire stack on the arbour and it fitted. I had to remove the inside washer and replace it with the outside washer, the nut goes on the outside of the stack. I have yet to use the stack as i have had some problems with my table saw, i wouldn't be surprised if there was some wobble given that the stack is unsupported on the outside apart from the blade nut. A blade stabalizer might be a good buy, i think i might also purchase a set of Veritas slotted shims which are colour coded.",2.0
"I recently bought this dado set for a cabinet project.  I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the cuts.  The sides of the cuts were very smooth and accurate, but the bottoms of the cuts were very uneven - even worse than simply using a 1/8"" saw blade to make repeated passes. I'm using this set on a new Ridgid 10"" table saw and the fit on the arbor is extremely snug, so a loose arbor fit isn't the problem.

For hidden dados where appearance or flatness isn't critical, this set is fine.  But if you need smooth, even bottom cuts, like for tenon shoulders or exposed rabbets, this blade set isn't up to the task... you're better off using a router or tenoning jig.",2.0
"I bought this a year ago, and have just recently been putting it to a lot of use.  After having done several projects now, I am not all that happy with it.  I bought it based on the Freud name and the price.  Does it work, yes.  I can't get flat bottom dado's... Every single time, my dado's have grooving from the outer blades.  This has been true with the 5 different dado widths I have cut.  Bummer..  The holes in the blades are not all the same diameter, this is a minimal difference but some don't even fit on my arbor...  Some are a bit loose... This would probably explain the grooves left in my dado's, and why some people have flat dado's and some don't...  As far as the setup chart with shims and chippers goes... The width configurations are confusing.. This has led to a lot of time testing out shim and chipper configurations... An example of confusing shim/stack setup is 13/32"" and 15/32"" have the exact same configuration, with no further explanation...  So what is the real measurement of stack A+B+C+D+S1+S2 if two measurements are given? It would have been a lot better to get an actual cut width and ply width designation.  It can be figured out, but wastes time.  I have the Forrest WWII as my main blade, which has now set my standard for blades... even with it's high cost, it ends up being well worth it in the long run..  I would not recommend this Freud dado setup for a profesional result, and look forward to buying the Forrest dado set. The best solution to this Freud dado stack setup is to take an hour or two and cut all the dado combinations on to one piece of wood.  That way you have this stick to test all of your pieces and quickly the proper stack setup for your project.  It is cheap though, so if that gets you cutting dado's, get it!

I did find much more correct dado stack setups at the Freud site.  The chart I recieved with my purchase did not have the same information, so they must have figured this out and revised it online. I hope this one IS correct. [...]

Happy wood working!",2.0
"On this otherwise very good blade, I have a serious problem.  I gave it 2 stars because it cuts very good.  The problem is that it advertises itself as a 5/8's arbor.

"The idea behind this gun is great-a nail-gun equivalent of the cordless drill and no compressor.  Some of the hoseless finish nailers are great, but this thing just isn't able to compete with the pneumatic framing nail-gun.  First, it's slooooow, especially on plywood.  I realy question the claim of two or three nails per second.  One has to push down and then pull the triger for every nail, then wait for it to recharge the chamber before it will fire again.  Then there are the missfires.  They are so often that sometimes I am wondering if it is messing up again or out of fuel again.  The tip is almost useless for toe nailing and the toe-nail often still has as much as an inch not driven in.  Finaly the handle is shaped such that it is hard to hold when framing a wall.
When the sawsall and skill saw were new the respective company who popularised each made the best, and still do.  But with the cordless drill the company that popularised it made a marginal one and the market was soon overran with better models.  I do not know if the hoseless nail-gun will ever become pratical, but if it is we will have to wait for better models.",2.0

So naturally don't fix it if it ain't broke, bought this one which is almost identical to the previous version but maybe a bit thinner. This one failed after four months of minimal use. It will not lock the bit into place, so the bit can easily fall out!

"I gotta say that this torpedo level is a nice size, has a lot of features and looks great.  However, one critical component is lacking...they filled the vials with too much liquid making the bubble so small it's nearly impossible to get an accurate measurement.  I picked up a 9"" Swanson torpedo at the same time (just in case) and it's a much easier-to-read level, just like my Stabilas.  The Checkpoint is going back.",2.0

"Not very happy with this blade. After only a few months of light use, I have bent teeth and one missing. The only thing I've cut on this blade is Cherry - which hasn't given my other blades any issues. My last blade (an Irwin Marples) lasted about 2 years with the same light to moderate use.",2.0
"This item is made pretty well. Holds securely. Love the feature of pulling outward to release, simply pushing the bit into the holder and it automatically snaps to hold.

BUT, this holder is actually very long, it is too long,... 3 inches long. That longer 3in length means more of a wobble when the chuck spins the drill bit.  There is more loss of control in precise situations when the bit starts 3 inches out from the chuck. After it arrived I tried to find out how I made that mistake. But there is no mention of the length in the description beside the picture or directly below. Hmmmm.

So I backtracked further to see how I got snookered. Looking at the product picture, it does not appear to be particularly long. But pictures can be deceptive.  The reviews were good. Don't think anyone mentioned or complained about the length. If they did I missed it.  How was I supposed to know it was 3 inches long?? Finally, I  checked the dimensions buried in the description: 5.8 x 2.9 x 1.3 inches. What does that mean to you? To me, that's unclear. Nothing about this item is 6in long, 3in wide etc..  5.8x2.9x1.2inches seems to be the  dimension of the shrink wrap cardboard the loader is encased in. That is not a fair description in my book. Reported this to Amazon Customer Support.

So I searched Amazon & ordered a Wera K Rapidaptor that's top quality, same features, 1/3 shorter than the Dewalt, and they did not hide the length of the holder...2inches.  The line description beside the Wera holder is this: ""Wera 889/4/1 K Rapidaptor Universal Bit Holder for 1/4"" Hex Drives, 2in Long.""  Everything is right up front. The Wera carries a higher price but you get higher quality, more compact length, more control & LESS wobble vs the Dewalt DW2505 & is well worth the few extra dollars.  Cannot recommend the 3in Dewalt DW2505.",2.0
"These came bent (you can see the tip of the bit spinning around in a circle, instead of just spinning), which was a mild annoyance but didn't seem to affect their performance.  However, this seems to put too much stress on the bits themselves and after only a few dozen holes drilled, the smaller bit just broke in half.  They worked great until that point but I'd recommend looking for another option.",2.0

"I didn't purchase these through amazon, but I have purchased a couple sets of these through my local home supply store.  I would like to first say I have never been a fan of dewalt products.  I think their products are overrated and overpriced tools targeted towards contractors and construction workers.  Every dewalt power tool I have ever had just did not last.  I use Milwaukee and Makita power tools consistently.  They out perform and outlast dewalt products.  The reason I gave them 2 stars is because they just break to easily.  Is not because I just do not like dewalt.  I gave them 2 stars because  If you drop them on a hard surface such as concrete, you can kiss the tip of the bit goodbye.  If you are using these bits consecutively on a big job they break when the bit starts to heat up.  It's a great tapered countersink bit before it breaks.  The tapered bit itself plunges right through hardwood such as birch and the countersink sicks easily in a hardwood such a birch unlike some other countersinks that you have to press down really hard on and they just end up burning the wood.  The problem with these is they just break to easily.  Like I said I have never liked dewalt tools and even though these are just drill bits.  They serve to cement my opinion about dewalt.  In fact most people who fall in love with dewalt is because they see others around them using it and they have never really experienced any other tool.  Choose Milwaukee.  They make much better tools.",2.0

"Granted I've had this blade for 5 years.  But I don't abuse my tools [been a woodworker since 1960] and this is only one of 30 blades I have on-hand.  So as I'm ripping some sweet gum lumber the other day, and when the blade stops, it just happens to stop with a 'chipped tooth' at TDC [top dead center].

It's obvious to me that it was a bad tooth to begin with ... 'cause for anyone who has ever horsed junk wood, if you hit a nail [or similar] you're going to take out more than one.  But no other tooth is in less-than-perfect condition.  The carbide fractured near the base but didn't snap off the base.  My experience says ""bad carbide"".

I used the ""contact"" page at Freud.com to ask if there's a lifetime on ""workmanship and materials"" ... I would think there would be.  But, surprisingly, I haven't heard a peep from them.

Not bad,2.0
the tool does not work as depicted.  the pinch pins that straddle the joist do not grip the wood and are continually slipping.. resorted to modifying the tool by welding cleats to bite the wood to hold in place..  Save your money and use a 16penny nail or heavy screw and a crow bar.,2.0
"I do not mean to turn anyone away from this product.

That being said, to give you an analogy, buying this tapered countersink set is like choosing to get your cup of coffee at a BP gas station versus Starbucks (with strength/caffeine content serving as quality/construction).

I gave this bit set 2 stars for a couple of reasons: (1) all bits broke off on me within a month of use on wood, (2) the counterbores are useful if you own a quality set whose original counterbores have become dull.

I would recommend this product for someone who needs a quick fix for a project or two; in contrast, I would steer any professional or hobbyist away from this product as their money is much better spent on a W.L. Fuller set.  Specifically, I own Fuller's No. 8 countersink set -- one of the bits fell 30 feet onto concrete floor and it still works like new without a nick on it.

Hope this helps.",2.0
"Many years ago I had a combination drill and countersink for wood screws. It consisted of a half drill (flat on one side) a relief cutter for the shank, and a countersink cutter. It was adjustable from short to long, and worked well. I anticipated the DeWalt version doing as well. I was going to build a redwood potting bench for a friend, and didn't want the inevitable oversized countersinks on holes to spoil the looks.

One problem was that the maximum length on the #6 drill (including countersink) was 1 1/2"". They do make #6 screws longer than that.

But the thing that made the tool almost worthless was the angle on the countersink. I had no way to precisely measure that angle, but I couldn't find a single screw that matched it and it was obviously more obtuse than my countersinks.

There are two common angles on wood screws: 82 degrees (US) and 90 degrees (Europe). Apparently the DeWalt tools use the 90 degree countersink. That means that a 82 degree screw (more acute angle) will bottom out before its chamfer is seated if screwed into a 90 degree countersunk hole. Since there's no stop to keep the countersink from going deeper--it won't get larger in diameter--one can keep drilling until the head is flush. In other words, drill/try, drill/try. It just won't be right even if flush.

This meant that I might as well drill a pilot hole, then use another drill motor to carefully countersink (82 degrees) until the head is flush.

There is an 82 degree countersink with stop made by Amana, which I'm going to try next.

I'm giving two stars on behalf of our European woodworking friends.",2.0
"These are great in theory, but have several problems in use: 1) they are larger in diameter than you would want to use, in softwoods, for the indicated screw size; 2) they aren't that long so only work with shorter screws; and 3) the countersink part of the bit doesn't stay tight unless you REALLY crank down on it.  After buying these I still mostly use a conventional bit followed by a separate pass with a countersink-only bit.  Can't really recommend these.",2.0
"I intended to use the Bowwrench on my 5/4 #1 treated southern yellow pine deck boards (kiln-dried after treatment).  I purchased the deck boards from a local lumber yard which has admittedly higher quality lumber than the big box hardware stores.  The largest bow on my 16 boards is maybe 1, but many have a very small bow of maybe  or less.  What I found is that there must be a minimum bow of at least  or maybe even 1 or larger for this tool to be able to be used.  When I tried to use the tool to straighten out the  or  bow, the joist grip portion of the tool would just slide along the joist.  There wasn't enough resistance to keep the tool in place.  I might could have wrapped the joist grip pegs with a rubber material, but I came up with a simple method of straightening my boards that involved inserting a flat heavy gage metal plate in the 1/8 gap of the adjacent secured deck boards and then using a clamp to pull the plate and the slightly bowed deck board together.",2.0
"The sleeve works great, but I was very disappointed in the durability of the Phillips bit that came pre-loaded in it. Seemed more like a cheap store brand than a DeWalt product.",2.0
The speed lock attachement at the end is only pressed on and comes off after only a few times of use.  you can still use the bit as a regular bit but in a chuck but it doesn't hold as well as the hex lock end.  I'm am the second person who bought this same set and had the same problem.  I will probably replace the center tapered bit with a regular bit and continue to use the countersink but I most likely won't buy these again.,2.0
"I have been using these bits on red oak for a project today.  They work fine if I am drilling through 3/4 in boards but when drilling into end grain the fluting does not clear out quickly enough and then they discolor and come out with burnt material and smoke rolling off.  This happens less on low speed for my drill, on high speed it is near flames.  Happens on my cordless drill so I tried my drill press and had the same result.  Again, pre-drilling the boards and countersinking them the bit is great as for going full depth in hardwood - not so much; I went back to a regular bits.  Also note, when using the drill press - raising the bit out of the hole 3 times during drilling minimize the burning as it cleared out the bit - that is not the intent of this for me since it was meant to be used on a cordless drill.",2.0

"The bits are sharp enough to drill, and the countersink part is adjustable, but if you are supposed to adjust it to the length of the wood screw (i was using #6 3/4"" screw), you will not get an even pilot hole, the pilot hole is too tapered and the screw will not go in. I guess if you change the size to be larger then it would go in better, but then your pilot hole would be larger than the screw possibly going through the other side of the workpiece. I had to use my regular untapered drill bit and then use this piece as a countersink bit.",2.0

This tool is only good for single joist deck unless you spend more money and buy an additional accessory.",2.0
"I see all the good reviews on this hose, but my experience was not pleasant.
I can only assume that mine was defective, with a built-in permanent twist.

It was very aggravating because I cannot coil this hose up for storage or to hang it on the wall - regardless if it's under air pressure or not. All my previous air hoses did not have this problem. I can coil them up easily for transport or storage.

I really like the bright orange color and the hose seems very tough. Rather than return or trash it, I cut it's length short and now I'm using it as a feeder hose from my compressor to an air hose cord reel.

Again, maybe my hose was defective, so it might be a good idea for you to check and inspect yours upon delivery.

I figured spending the extra to get a Dewalt product would result in getting a better tool.  This turned out to not be true.  The magnet of this bit holder is close to worthless.  I have a no-name bit holder that has a much better magnet at a lower cost.  Look elsewhere if you use this tool professionally.,2.0
"I remember when Dewalt made quality tools, cheaper brands make better quality shafts. The bit holder magnet is the weak link that makes this tool useless to someone that uses it full time.

"This is the first time I've ever given an unfavorable product review, but I feel compelled to speak.

I've always loved Freud products for their quality and the thought put into their design. As such, I find it hard to believe that this bit set was made by them. Oh, the bit quality is fine, but the adjustment functionality just flat sucks. Each bit comes with a set of spacers, of varying thicknesses (11 spacers for the tongue bit and 9 for the groove bit.) None of them are marked! You can differentiate the extreme ends but the spacers of similar thicknesses cannot be told apart without mechanical assistance. (I ended up having to buy a Mitutoyo outside micrometer to do the job. Great mic BTW, see my review for it on it's own page.) Further, once mic'ed, I find that the spacers don't even match those (presumably) indicated on the sketchy sizing chart which accompanies the bits. They don't even match each other! (That is to say, the set with the tongue bit does not duplicate the set with the groove bit.)

If you only rarely have to adjust the bit spacing (i.e ALL your tongue & groove cuts will be 1/2"") or you like having to fiddle with something before getting it right, then this bit set will work fine for you. Otherwise, be prepared for a major disappointment!",2.0

Takes too much time to set up for the proper fit.,2.0
"I saw this bit in my woodworking magazine and thought it would be a nifty way to create some drawer boxes I was building.  After burning up hours of my time shredding almost all of my scrap wood, I realized this bit is only practical if you have high end woodworking equipment that is highly calibratable and very accurate.  It produces an interesting joint but the amount of time and experience necessary to set it up makes it an underwhelming product.  Here is the journey I took getting this beast to work:
The first thing I noticed is that corners needed to be at exactly 90 degrees so a near-cabinet-grade table saw is required.  I purchased a new Jet saw with high end miter for about $1,300.  Next it was obvious my old router table wasn't going to cut it so I bought a Bench Dog cast iron table, insert, and oversized ring for $365 that attached to my new Jet Table Saw.
I still couldn't get the bit to correctly cut so I bought a special jig that sets the height correctly for $35.  That still didn't get it so I bought a digital height gauge for $29 to try and ensure the bit height and distance from the fence was consistent.  It wasn't long before I found that the thickness of the wood needed to be very accurate so I bought a Dewalt planer for $400.  After straining hemorrhoid setting the 85 pound planer onto my work table I knew I was going to need a planer table so I bought one for $150.
This setup almost worked but my old router wasn't capable of micro-adjustments from the top of the router table so I bought a new Bosch router for $135.
With all my new stuff I was able to get the bit to work by setting the top of the large diameter blade to .403 above the table surface and .396 from the tip of the large cutter to the router fence.  Those dimensions took me about 20 cuts to establish.
So, all this to say, Yes, it will work but only if you are willing to spend about $2,300 in upgrades to make a $35 bit work.  My recommendation is to just spend $200 on a dovetail jig and be done with it.",2.0
Maybe I got a defective one...did not last the entire job...had to buy local to finish work...Cutting edge started to chip and pit...dulled very fast.,2.0
The tenion is too long for the mortis. That's not adjustable. It works you just can't ride the bearing. You must use your fence. Maybe its a fluke? I have been happy w all other Freud products.,2.0
"Hardware loose in box scratched paint.  Missing one nut and washer due to the hardware not being packaged properly. Also, for my PM66 I had to elevate the saw so the exhaust port could clear the mobile base.",2.0
"After reading other reviews that stated the packaging was poorly executed, I was inclined to purchase this locally, wish I had. My box showed up with three large holes ripped in it, and nuts, washers and bolts falling out. I had to provide some of the hardware myself because of missing parts. Could Powermatic not have placed the hardware in a plastic bag rather than just throw them loosely in the box? The paint on the rails had been scraped off in a few places as well from shipping damage so I'll have to touch it up. The paint is simply sprayed on, with runs, and not powder coated, which that would hold up better to bumps and knocks.
The base is decently constructed and strong enough to hold my model 66, and the casters beefy enough, otherwise I would have rated this product a one star.",2.0
joint is very lose,2.0
"Although this router bit cuts fairly cleanly, I have a major issue with it's manufacturer description and dimensions shown right on the packaging. My objective was to get about 1/2 inch engagement distance between the drawer side and front which would allow for additional 1/4 dowel pins to be added for strength and looks. The 99-240 bit packaging shows a dimension of 33/64 inch as the engagement length but that is just incorrect. As another reviewer stated  this bit requires a fixed engagement of 3/8 inch only. Freud should understand their tools and market things accurately.

The best setup instructions come from lee valley where their drawer lock bit is set up for only 1/4 inch engagement. Follow their instructions substituting 3/8 for 1/4 and you can use the Freud bit in appropriate locations like the back to side joints when using 1/2 thick stock.",2.0
"This was a pretty good bit, but honestly I don't see them use. I use it for pre-drilling screw holes in cabinets and honestly I think a regular bit works better. Plus this one broke from the chuck.",2.0
Freud makes good saw blades but the router bits are another story. As everyone else has said packaging is bad not on Amazon's part but the manufactures. Like a lot of the other reviews bits where lose inside plastic box from Freud and yes they did have a very small chip in one of the bits. Not bad enough to send back but it still was a chip. As far as the bits them selves there ok not great. This is the only set of Freud bits I have and it will probably be the last. CMT and Whiteside are the bits I use. They may be a little pricey but the are great bits,2.0
"I won't repeat what others have said about no instructions included as I found magazine articles on how to set up a lock mitre bit.  I'll cut to the chase - my first mitred leg, in QS white oak, was a disaster.  Out-of-square with corners that don't meet, otherwise a very strong joint, just can't use the piece.  I have the remaining 12 blanks ready for the other three legs, pre-beveled on both edges, but do I want to ruin even more expensive hardwood?  The thing is, not only do the bit & fence have to be perfectly set-up, but each of the four pieces has to be perfectly square and straight and you can't run the pieces vertically through the bit more than once at final pass because there is no bearing face left for a second pass.  I thought I could do this, but it is above my skill level.  Stay away from this unless you are an advanced woodworker or professional.",2.0
did not work ladder slid sideways wheels were not straight they were like a caster wheel on a cart and could be pshed in any direction so they would go just about any direction up op the roof Very dangerous,2.0
"I purchased 2 hooks so I could access my very steep roof.  The products seems very well made and very heavy and durable.  Unfortunately, these hooks don't fit on a 28' or 24' Werner ladder!  So, I have a useless product that doesn't fit on the most widely used ladder available on the market.",2.0
"Had to return them because my roof is a metal one, which is unsafe for these. Wish I had noticed that before buying them.",2.0
"I am astonished by the quality of this fence, and not in a good way. Overall, the build, fit and finish are very rough, but let's get into the specifics. 1: documentation is poor, as noted by other reviewers. 2: packaging is inadequate. Parts banged and rubbed against each other in transit, resulting in scratched paint. 3: the extruded aluminum parts used to mount the tube to the saw were roughly cut and had poorly milled slots that are way oversized for the included bolts, so much that if you tighten the bolts, the washers distort, pulling through the slots and tweaking the aluminum out of shape. Also, the steel components of the fence mounting hardware were uncoated and had topical rust. 4: the fence tube rail has several tapped holes in its bottom, all out of alignment with each other. It looks like it was hurriedly done by hand, not by machine. 5: the measuring tape is good, but the reticle line is almost 1/16 wide. It's actually a sticker with a red line, stuck onto the bottom of a clear acrylic window. Not a bad design choice, but the line needs to be much smaller to be effective. Also, the acrylic window ends up almost 1/4 inch above the measuring tape, which allows for significant parallax error: move your head from side to side and you can read a 1/16 inch difference in the fence position.

All of these issues could be fixed by Vega if they wanted to up their quality game. Here's what I did to make it all function: I ended up using larger bolts to attach the fence to the saw, bent and twisted the aluminum parts back into shape and filed off the burrs, removed the rust and painted the steel parts, drilled and tapped new holes in the steel tube (my saw didn't have the right hole pattern so this would have been necessary anyway), and removed the included acrylic window and made my own out of 1/2"" acrylic instead of their 1/4"". I painted a thin red line on the underside by masking off all but a hair's width with masking tape, then spraying some red rattle-can. Now the indicator line is thin and is almost touching the tape, like it should be. Finally I added a white UHMW face to the fence. I can't comprehend why Vega thought a black fence surface was a good idea, because you can't see the shadow line if your part pulls away from the fence. Bizarre. Overall, it was a lot of work to get this fence to the quality it should have been shipped in. I have another saw I need a fence for, and I will definitely not buy another Vega. I wish I hadn't bought this one either, but there's not much out there to choose from.",2.0
"I really dislike how this product page is used for multiple Frued bits and sets. I had previously reviewed another set from the drop-down and when I tried to review the glass panel set, my old review came up. Dumb.

This is the first Freud bit/sit that I don't like. I have quite a few from them.

It's a sloppy joint, for starters. This is unrelated to adjusting the height. The two halves just don't fit tightly at all. Crazy. Also, I was not happy with their spline. I reviewed that separately but I'll include pics of the joint and the spline here.",2.0
"Freud is known for great quality in their router bits and certainly give Whiteside and other manufacturers a real run for their money.  I ended up ordering two of this set before I finally gave up and bought a matched pair from another manufacturer.  The first set was returned for a chipped rail cutter caused by the bit being loose inside the manufacturer's packaging.  Amazon quickly replaced the set so I was really ready to go.  I set up and cut test cuts in order to measure the current tenon/groove width.  Using thin plywood for doors, I then calculated how much I needed to reduce the tenon and groove and proceeded to remove the shims as instructed.  However, the bearing on the stile bit appeared to be nearly a press fit and I was unable to remove it and adjust the bit.  So much for the close tolerance engineering.  I also noted that there is a lot of height above the rail cutter....it shows in the picture but when it is in your router table, you really notice it.  I had to back the fence away, because of the fence-to-bit interference.  Not a problem if you are just switching bits but if you are removing the top to do an extended tendon...and instruction say to not move your fence, you may have a problem.",2.0

There were absolutely no clear instructions on how to adjust the cutters for different thicknesses of stock, how to adjust the cutters to assure your stub tenon fit your mortise, I went to You Tube and watched several instructional videos extolling the wonderfulness of the product, but none that showed how to actually adjust it. In fact I discovered a major flaw in the videos. The set is able to cut extended tenons by removing one component of the tenon cutter. While the video showed how to do this it left out the fact that ( and I discovered this while I was examining all the little pieces sent with the set.) If you do not insert the little black screw found in the package, you will pack the opening left by the removal of the top cutter with sawdust ( this was totally intuitive). No mention of this what so ever. I have not tried the set yet but I suppose I will waste a lot of wood trying to figure it out. Thank you Freud.",2.0

"This review is in response to those who have been blaming Amazon for damage to these router bits because of poor packaging.  You're complaining to the wrong company.  The damage is not Amazon's fault; it's Freud's fault.  There is too much open space above the bits in their plastic display case.  (See my attached image.)

When the box hockey aficionados at UPS kick the boxes around, there is nothing to secure the bits to their mounting holes.  The shorter one comes flying out and spends the rest of the trip bouncing into the other one, chipping off bits of carbide with each strike.

When I ordered my first set, the person at Amazon who packaged it wrapped a huge wad of bubble-wrap around it.  The whole thing was about the size of a soccer ball.  That protected the plastic display case nicely, but did nothing to hold the bits in place inside the case.  As I mentioned above, the shorter bit came loose as the box zoomed past the UPS goalie and spent the rest of its time in transit hopping up against the other bit.

Amazon quickly sent me a replacement set. This time they were not packaged as well as the first time, but box hockey season was apparently over because the bits and their display case arrived in perfect condition.

Freud, fix your ill-considered packaging!",2.0

"I was terribly disappointed with the quality control by Vega on this fence.  The cursor was broken...not cracked but broken in half.  The bolts in the head were very hard to turn and when they did turn metal shavings fell out.  Several turns in and out made three of the bolts easier to turn but one remained tight.  When I looked under the head I could see several  threads of the micro adjusting screw where they appeared to have  broken through the head and the surface that would ride on the tube was very rough and could possibly scratch the tubes surface.  The overall finish of every part except the tube was poor and not what I would expect on a new fence from Vega.  There was a scratch on the fence that was deep enough to have removed the anodized finish.  The anodizing was uneven and possibly thin in some places.  I have a 15 year old fence from the big B without a scratch on the fence surface.
Several buyers have found similar problems with the Pro 50 but decided to use the fence and have been very happy with it's performance.  I could have taken the chance that mine would work as it should but I'd always be thinking of the problems I'd found.

Amazon's service was perfect as usual.  The fence was delivered on time and they processed my request for refund immediately.  I can order from Amazon with complete confidence every time.  Their customer service is first rate.",2.0

"As an Amazon PRIME member, I ordered the bit knowing it would arrive in time to use over the weekend.  After opening the factory sealed package I noticed that the bit had a small ship in the blade profile that will result in a flaw in the wood cut.  Unfortunately I will have to use it any way as I depended on the product arriving for use THIS weekend to meet a scheduled deadline.  I will not be able to return it after it is used.  I'm stuck using a ""defective"" bit.  NOT Amazon's fault as it was packaged correctly and even 100% protected by the factory sealed package. It is apparent that the damage to the bit occurred in the factory and was not caught by any sort of ""quality control"" on Freud's part.  EXAMINE PRODUCT FROM FREUD VERY CLOSELY UPON RECEIPT.  IT SEEMS THEY HAVE A QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEM.  Sigh...its always something.",2.0
"I just finished installing the Vega ""Professional"" 40 table saw fence system on my Unisaw.
I mounted the fence about 3 "" to the left of their hole locations which gave me about 10"" rip capacity to the left of the blade, and about 36"" to the right of the blade.
The engineering concept of fence system is actually pretty good.  The front rail looks to be centerless ground, as it is very straight, only out about 0.003"" in 42"".  The rear tube is straight.
I must have received the first fence Vega subbed out to some back yard shop since no one else has mentioned how poorly this thing is manufactured.  This is without a doubt the shoddiest piece of workmanship I have ever seen.  Even the stuff from China now shows far better craftsmanship. There were burrs everywhere. I even cut myself pretty nicely on one before grinding, and filing all the sheared edges of the mounting plates, and filing the burs on tapped and punched holes.
The aluminum brackets which support the front rail are about 3/8"" thick.  The slots for mounting were punched rather than drilled and milled.  They tried to clean up the sloppy ""blow out"" by partially milling the rough edges.  The slots for mounting the round front rail were not even in the center of the mounting saddle.  I do not know why they punched the slot clear out the end of the brackets on one side, severely weakening them.  I cleaned up all the slots in my mill with an end mill the best I could.  I have requested new un-punched brackets from Vega.
 The 1 "" square tubing for the rear of the table has a very thin (0.095"") wall.  If you do not place spacers on the inside of the tube, the tube will simply be smashed when you tighten the bolts to a reasonable torque.  I made my own spacers.  The ends of the tube were not cut square, very noticeable. I squared them up.
The front tube has a 0.100"" thick wall, and was simply tapped for mounting bolts.  This gives you less than 2 threads in the wall.  The aluminum mounting brackets are made with a ""V"" saddle which has a considerable gap in the center for the bolts.  Tightening the bolts with no backup inside the tube would distort the tube.  I made some nice tapped, ""half moon"" nuts for the inside of the tube.
The so called ""micro adjustment"" feature was simply un-usable.  When the small micro adjust cam was locked down you could not even turn the adjustment knob to adjust the fence since the whole thing was in a bind.  It will end up in the trash.  My opinion is this is just a sales gimmick anyway, as you don't need it.
Really crappy paint job.  Dust, dirt in the paint, missed areas, overspray on the sliding surface of the main slide.  Must have been done with rattle can.  It was not epoxy since it came right off with lacquer thinner.  I will put a descent paint job on it.
I almost threw it back in the box and sent it back, but I thought it had potential once it was cleaned up, and properly mounted.  It does actually function pretty well.  This fence resembles a one-time prototype rather than a production unit.
 I'm sorry I didn't buy a 30"" Biesmeyer, it was the same price.",2.0
"Bought two thinking would use on two ladders on 10:12 new roof. As with the other reviewers found that a pair is needed for each ladder.
Good point: the wheel swivels.
Otherwise: the radius of the hook is too tight and cannot think that this will handle ridge vents; the bearing material on the end of the hook (angle iron) is too sharp and will cut felt; the adjustment of the bearing material is impractical - thought that if I loosened the bolt (the nut is of the locking type so presumed this is the designer's intention)the angle iron would adjust to the roof, instead one end swiveled into the vertical position and gouged the roof surface (am using the ZIP system so surface damage has to be repaired).
What to do? Looked beyond Amazon and bought the ACRO 11081 Roof Hook. One per ladder. None of the problems with the above. Only possible con is that the wheel does not swivel: so far not a big deal.",2.0

"I bought this clamp for use in gluing up the legs on an antique east lake table I am repairing. While tightening the strap clamp, a plastic part failed. I had done two dry runs to get the clamping plan worked out, but during glue up I tightened the clamp further than I did during the dry runs.  I admit I tightened it hard, but only by twisting the handle by hand, and I am no gorilla. If a lightweight like me was able to overtighten it by hand, then the material used by Bessey is inadequate for the clamp design. I did what I could to rescue the glue-up but my strategy relied heavily on the strap clamp.  I'll know tomorrow whether or not I will need to start from scratch.

I give it two stars rather than one because it would probably be a very nice tool for picture frame work.",2.0
"IT was okay for the money.  A little frustrating to put it around a solid molding frame without living a dent.

"It works as intended.  It works when you get it on.... therein lays the core issue.  Since i'm not Octavius from Spider Man, fitting this onto a frame while tightening it is a Major Pain in the Chunk.

When its on, its great.  You simply wind the handle and you can squeeze that frame like the feared Kraken from Ulysses.  It will creak for mercy.

BUT there are design issues.  The corner thingamabobs have a tendency to slip off.  They don't seem to grab the ribbon tight enough, so adjusting tension while doing the other 3 edges is an exercise in frustration.  Getting the corners Just Right, then winding the large retractor a Goldilocks amount, THEN winding the red handle.... man-o-man.

"I have tried to use this strap clamp on multiple projects and have not had any success. It's either I don't have 8 hands to hold everything and tighten it at the same time or it is beyond my knowledge base to operate. About the only thing it was good for was a miter cut box top or picture frame, something that can rest flat and that the plastic corners can lay on the bench top and tighten evenly. If its even a little off the plastic corners slip off the corner by rolling over the top or under the bottom. It's like the moon and stars all have to align before I can get it to work as intended. I would not purchase this product again.

After getting this strap clamp I made 2 picture frames and it didn't work for either one. The only way this works is if you have a wide edge all the way around the picture frame.

"I ordered this plastic strap clamp and attempted to use it once a couple of weeks ago.  I was clamping a hexagon piece that I cut, doweled and glued.  While I was turning the plastic handle to tighten the strap it sheared off, even before the wood came together. I had to quickly take off the strap clamp and get six pipe clamps to tighten down on the frame. (Luckily it was a regular hexagon and not an irregular shaped item.)

I would like to get a refund or credit for the clamp and the extra angle plates (6pack). But I ordered it over 30 days ago.  I am writing to Bessey in hopes that they will give me a refund or a credit toward another clamp.

I got this clamp on Saturday July 23rd.  After opening the package I noticed that one of the corner clamps was missing it's adjustable feet.  There are two triangular ""feet"" that are missing from the corner brace.  The other three were fine.  I called Bessey customer service on Monday (25th) morning when they opened.  I asked the woman I talked to if I should send the clamp back to Amazon or if she could ship an extra corner piece to me.  She said she had one on her desk and she'd ship it out to me.  I wrote an email to customer service on Monday August 8th stating that I haven't received the piece.  The same day I got a reply that it was put in the mail and I should receive it by the end of the week.  On Thursday August 18th I wrote back to confirm that the piece was sent to my address.  The next day I was told it was sent via regular mail so there was no way to track it but they'd send another one to my listed address.  It is now August 25th, one month after calling Bessey customer service and I have not received the piece.  I will ultimately be forced to buy the 6-pack of corner braces just to get the one I want.

I'm glad I bought Jet parallel clamps and Jorgensen bar and pipe clamps.

*EDIT* I finally got the piece after several communications with Bessey and several people's email addresses.  More than a month later I was able to use my product.  My advise is to ask Amazon to ship you a new one if you have the same problem.  Dealing with Amazon's returns is very easy.",2.0

"I've now had this saw for 3 years and can say that it is a poorly designed and very cheaply built tool.

The sole plate is a formed piece of sheet metal that is severely warped on the diagonal. There is no way to square saw blade to the sole plate.  Consequently, it is impossible to get a perpendicular cut. The sole plate is formed sheet metal, therefore it has a radius on all four edges. This makes it impossible to use a carpenters square or any similarly thin straightedge as a cut guide. If you try, the radiused edge of the sole plate rides up the straightedge, and you loose use of the guide.

In a full depth cut, the motor sits within 3/16 of the cutting surface. This requires a thin straightedge (carpenters square) if you want a guide for the cut, but the sole plate radiused edge rides up the straightedge. So, it's a catch twenty-two.

The bent metal rip guide is next to useless.

On the plus side: The motor is strong, but loud. The saw is double insulated. The saw blade guard works very well.",2.0
"I've had this saw for about a year now and it I'm very dissapointed with it.  It behaves as if the saw doesn't have enough power.

"Stilletto:
I have used the 14 oz Stilleto on and off now for several months.  Bottom line-  two Stars because I t's not worth the cost.

Pros:
It carries well.  It's light in the tool belt and the hickory handle slides in and out of a hammer loop nicely.
It's less likely to leave hammer marks in the wood.
Won't rust.

I'm
Cons:
Absolutely not worth the expense.
Not a good hammer for beginners as it requires harder and faster swings requiring good accuracy.
Requires more strikes to drive the same nail into the same material as a 19 oz steel hammer.
The hickory handle is slippery and difficult to hang on to until the handle is well broken in with sweat and grime.  A light coat of pine tar helps greatly.
Doesn't seem to ""set"" a nail flush with or slightly below the surface as well as a steel hammer.
Regardless of the title, this is not a ""framing"" hammer.  It's just too light.  Best use I've found is on both vinyl and cedar siding and 1/2 inch sheet goods.  Not at all applicable for demolition and too big for trim and finish work.",2.0

"I love the idea of a snap in splitter! I've been using my snap-in spreader for about two months now.  The splitter is slightly wider than an 1/8th of an inch. When the kerf contacts the splitter it can get hard to push the wood through. I finally had it with this splitter when I was ripping a piece of 12/4 Cherry and it got stuck on the splitter, much like an ax in wood. I had to stop the saw and whack the wood off the splitter. I finally called Biesemeyer, they said that it should be an 1/8th inch thick, they're sending a replacement. It is definitely not for a thin kerf blade. As for my blade, its an 1/8th inch Tenryu (I wanted to be different and got this blade over a Forrest) that cuts exactly 1/8th inch kerfs. I'll follow-up when the replacement arrives",2.0
"I was not impressed with the mobile base. Let me first say, that for lighter items in your shop (under 300 lbs.)  this mobile base would probably work great. My issue with the product is that I put a 450 lb vertical bandsaw on it. The first time I pressed the foot levers the weight of the machine on it make the wheel brackets bend. I am giving two stars because the description states, ""Rugged 500-lb capacity means your heaviest machines will glide out of your way.""
My Machine did not glide, it bent the frame. I did not feel like returning it and reinforced the areas that needed it and made the cart work.
So again for lighter machines this would work great just make sure if you have a really heavy machine over 300 lbs i would suggest Portamates PM-2500 its worth the extra money.",2.0

"I have wanted the Stiletto titanium hammer for about 2 years and finally I received as a gift.  I read all of the reviews on the hammer and one concerned me.  John Crawford reviewed it on October 30, 2000. He wrote that it is a cool hammer to nail nails but not to pull nails. He broke the handle after the third or forth nail.  He's right, I didn't even have mine on the job for two days.  I pulled a couple nails with it and then nailed a 16d nail and the head broke off.  The handle is way to thin which goes into the head. Don't get me wrong I fell in love with the hammer the first day but to be a every day framing hammer not a hammer to have.  I had to break out old faithfull, my Estwing.  I still have my old $15.00 framing hammer when I first started in construction over 10 years ago.  If they can figure out to make the handle stronger then the Stiletto is a must have.",2.0

I didn't know that until I pulled the third or fourth nail and the head of the hammer fell off.

"Base is well made, but the red lever will not stay in the down position as the bandsaw & base are rolled around on a finished concrete floor.  The levers will suddenly drop the load, which makes the saw unstable.  Something needs to be changed - base is unsafe.",2.0

I had to eliminate the cushion under the Bandsaw and lower it down to sit on the concrete floor. If I ever have to move it I will have to take up the cushions first. I'm not at all sure the one wheel will NOT collape.  This Base was supposed to support a heavier object than this, but I think it was a real mistake for me.

"I had this on my wish list and it was given as a gift, hence I'm not a ""verified purchase."" But anyway, I was really looking forward to a nice low-profile rolling base for my Craftsman table saw. I had a homemade base made of 2x6 boards and 360 casters that was at least 4"" too high for comfort. I got this and have been using it for about a year or so. I've come to hate it and want to switch back to my homemade base.  Here's why:
1) There are 2 pivoting casters and 2 fixed casters. This means you have to move it into position by ""parallel parking"" it. In other words if you want to store your saw against the wall when not using it, you have to drive the fixed wheels in against the wall then pivot the rotating casters in. Imagine your table saw in a shopping cart...sometimes you just want to pull it sideways and can't. This happened WAY too frequently in my small shop/garage.
2) The 2 fixed casters in the back have a ground clearance of about 1/2"" (zoom in on the picture and you can see how little clearance there is). The concrete from my garage to the driveway is not perfectly flat and the base hangs constantly on lips, cracks and bumps in the concrete and driveway. When I wheeled it all the way to my sidewalk so I could cut a large piece of plywood, it even hung up on the weeds and grass in the cracks of the sidewalk!
3) Wrestling the saw over these obstacles has now bent the brackets that form the square base. Minor, but when weeds bent the steel frame, I was more than a little disappointed in the quality.
Having said that, if you have a nice large shop where you can wheel your table saw around easily, and always keep it on perfectly smooth and level shop floor, this is fine. I just need something with more clearance and maneuverability.",2.0
I bought this base for a #300 band saw.  The description says that it is good up to #500's.  Not so.  I've had it just over 2 years.

"I am disappointed in the Fein tool kit for the following reasons:  the devices are lacking a basic positive-lock connection feature (often incorporated in the form of that classic little round-topped chrome button that springs up into a hole on the mating piece), and they generally are (aside from the floor attachment and chrome tubes) very light gauge material.  I have a ... little Eureka ""Mighty Mite"" compact vacuum, and its tools are actually more substantial than the supposedly ""industrial grade"" Fein products.  Ultimately I imagine these accessories will work fine, but I am actually amazed at the high price relative to what is provided.  ...

"Pros- modular and strong.

Cons- levers are hard to use as other users have stated.  You physically need to lift your tool to get them to engage and disengage.  The wheel bearings are falling out all over the place.  I have had at least 10 of the bearings show up around my shop.  Tool is useless without them and gets harder and harder to move each time.  When one gets lodged under a 300 lb table saw moving across your shop floor... saw stops and could tip, expensive epoxy floor chipped, and wheel gets damage. User miffed big time.  While the listing claims 500 lb capacity , that just isn't true .  Sitting still maybe but then , you might ask yourself , "" Am I shopping for a mobile base right now?  Do I want to leave my mobile base and coupled tool in one spot so the base won't explode ball bearings all over""?  I doubt it.

Do you plan to use this mobile base for a tool that weighs more than 200 lbs?

Both plastic levers break!  This thing is going to break and no one is going to give a rat's ass.  Do not attempt to contact HTC customer service or their parent company Affinity Tools.  They will not answer the phone, return voicemail, or reply to email.  If you're lucky enough to have this experience within amazon's 30 day return period send it in for a refund.

"I bought this to hold my band saw (G0555P) and I suppose it does.  However, overall I wasn't impressed at all with the quality.  I also bought a Jet 708118 mobile base for my jointer and it was night and day better.  Granted it was a few bucks more, but for the money I felt the quality of the Jet base was far superior and a much better value.  It went together much quicker and the connecting bars remained straight (the HTC combines multiple bars to create the various lengths and the tolerances aren't the best so they sag once weight is put on them, and you then have to re-adjust the band-saw or whatever to make the item level again, which is very annoying as the item is obviously very heavy!).",2.0

"I have had excellent service from my 2 older (10 yrs?) LU87R010 blades and just came on-line to order a new one while I get the old ones sharpened.  I noticed that the new one is flat ground (FTG).  My old blades have an ATB tooth ground configuration.  Why/when did they make this change?  I would think they would give it a new product number to indicate a difference.

For years I have been a faithful Forrest blade advocate.  Years ago when I was looking for a ""rougher"" cutting blade for ripping cheaper material in my contractor's TS, I bought the LU87R010.  I was amazed at how good of cut finish I got with it.  Not as glassy smooth as the Forrest in my cabinet saw but a very acceptable finish non-the-less.  I didn't think a thin kerf blade could get this kind of finish.  In fact I leave one in my cabinet saw most of the time now.  It doesn't give you a ""jointed"" edge but very close to it.  It's a very good value for the money; a ""best buy"" in my opinion.

EDITED REVIEW (update from my 5/1/13 review): After getting my new blade I am changing my previous assessment of this ""new"" blade down to 2 stars.  My older LU87R010 blades (with ATB teeth) stay at 5 stars.  I am currently ripping KD soft white 2x4s at a 37 deg diagonal; depth of cut is 2 3/8 inch with the 2x4s in the vertical orientation.  I cut approx 24 boards with one of my old blades, then installed the new blade to finish the remaining 24 boards.  My first reaction to the new blade was that it took slightly more force to push the material through the saw.  The material would sometime ""ride up"" on the blade as if the wood was trying to close down on the back side of the blade, which it wasn't. A little disconcerting.  My older blades never did this.  It's also a little noisier than the old ones.  On the plus side the new blade gave a slightly better finish.  The old blade left a little fuzz on the cut whereas the new blade did not.  That may be attributed to the new blade being sharper.  I'm obviously not as impressed with the newer version of this blade.  Knowing what I know now I would look for a different blade than this one for ripping.",2.0
"I've had this installed on my Jet 18"" bandsaw.  It went together well.  The directions were a little vague.  It makes moving the saw easier, obviously.

However:
1) The small wheels get stuck on pretty much everything
2) It picks up the tool in order to move, or drops it to keep it in place.  It's a heavy saw, and I don't like this.
3) Only the wheels by the levers turn.  Makes it hard to steer.

Currently it's still on the band saw, but I've bought a different brand to try.  (Shop Fox) I haven't installed it yet, but I won't buy another one.  Maybe the HTC3000 works better, but it costs a lot more too.",2.0

Swithced to the Freud 1050 10"" combination for ripping on my table saw and it is smooth and quite, cuts smooth and easy, I recomend this one",2.0
"A poorly designed tool base, not suitable for use with a relatively tall tool such as a band saw.  To move the band saw around it is necessary to raised one side of the base thus tilting the tool to a seemingly unstable angle.  The casters are not vertical when deployed thus making it difficult to role the tool around. Also the casters must the deployed one at a time rendering the band saw even more unstable.  I would return the base if it were not for the fact that the base is difficult to remove when attached to such a heavy too.  I do not recommend this mobile base for any but the lightest tools.",2.0
"First off - if you're buying this base it's probably because you can't find a mobile base specific for your needs.  Hands down, the best mobile bases are made by Delta.  They're simple, durable, effective  and easy to use.  Check to see if Delta makes a size similar to what you need first.

"Wow...I saw all the good reviews and was expecting an amazing blade...boy was I wrong.  The thing did cut quickly and easily but when I looked at the edge of the board it was TERRIBLE!  I would have to joint the board 1/16"" to get rid of all the marks it left.

I am sure that my table saw is adjusted properly cause I just checked it with a dial indicator.  I also look at the results I get from my Ridgid combination blade, which are like glass.  The Freud is almost like what you get from a bandsaw blade but with burn marks to boot!

Maybe this blade needs a stabilizer to work properly, but I'm not going to buy one to find out if I can return this.",2.0

"I spent a good deal of time reading reviews of various mobile bases for my 10"" table saw and 14"" bandsaw. The HTC2000 had many positive reviews so I bought it. In general, the hardware, quality and instructions were about what I expected except that one corner piece was rusted. To their credit, HTC shipped a new part promptly.

So I was generally happy with the base until I assembled it and installed it on my table saw. It was then that I saw a design flaw that I just cannot live with. Lowering the casters raises the feet about one inch off the floor when a quarter inch would be more than enough. Raising the feet so high creates several problems. One, the actuating levers are hard to work because they start lifting too early. You have to forcefully lift up on the lever before you can step down on it. Two, the high lift causes your equipment to tilt excessively. If you install this on a top heavy piece of equipment with a narrow base (such as a bandsaw), I guarantee you will be alarmed at the amount of tilt. Finally, the high lift causes the swivel axis of the caster to be tilted. This causes the caster to have a preferred rolling direction so the equipment can be difficult to steer.

I really don't understand why HTC designed their product this way. It's like they never actually tried using one. (The fix would be easy: just raise the caster mount about 3/4"".) Unfortunately, I could not think of a reasonable home-brew fix, so I'm returning the product.

The table itself is sturdy, but the fence is useless, the miter guide and slot are sloppy, and the router plate screws are cheap and poorly aligned. With the fantastic quality of table, fence, and miter system designs that are available in any woodworker magazine, consider spending on some plywood before you waste your money on this table.",2.0
"Don't buy this model if you plan on using it for your 36"" wide storage cabinet.  The advertised 36"" maximum length is measured from the outside of the frame.

"Well, I just got thru assembling the HTC 3000
and it took over four hours. Lousy instruction
manual, not clear at all on the sequence of
assembly; had to unbolt it a number of times
in order to get it to fit correctly because
of the way the wheels have to be bolted on.
The next one, IF there is a NEXT one, should
be a lot easier to assemble since I now know
what to allow for in advance. I can say this
however,it does appear to do the job quite well
and with the free S&H and ESPECIALLY it being
MADE IN THE USA !!!!!!! Kudos for that HTC !!",2.0
"I ordered the HTC 2000 for my 17"" drill press. It seemed to me to be too light weight - the rails were very thin flat steel with a slight roll on the edge for stiffness I suppose. The casters were also light duty. When I say light duty I am comparing it to the Grizzly/Shop Fox 7314. It is a much stronger unit, heavier casters and boxed rails. I own 4 of them and can say they do their job. I ordered the HTC as a cost saving measure. It is $59 vs $69 for the Griz. The Grizzly is actually $20 more since no super saver shipping, but worth the extra. More heft for the buck. I just returned the HTC and ordered a Grizzly 7314 in it's stead. I should have stuck with what works.",2.0
"I have eleven heavy power tools on a variety of mobile bases.  I ended up having to use this one for a relatively light parallel-arm scroll saw.  It works OK, but certainly not strong enough for anything heavier.",2.0
"I would recommend going with a heavier-built base. I bought one of these for a 14"" bandsaw. It took an hour to assemble and the plastic foot pegs broke when setting the brake. Very frustrating, not worth even the low price paid for it. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more on a more heavily constructed mobile base.",2.0
hey i return this item back ib august and i;m still waiting for my refund  robert v,2.0
"My hubby ordered two of them.  The one he used for the bandsaw broke at the plastic flap that locks the wheels:( and it was after 2 weeks we installed it.  The other one is still doing okay, and he used that for a drill press which normally doesn't go anywhere.  Will not recommend.",2.0
"Now I believe I'm in the minority based on these reviews I see. Let me tell you my experience and use your own judgement, it's fine to have a differing opinion.
I used this for my Jet contractor saw, not that time consuming to put together but more so than the one piece unit I replaced it with.
Trying to lock it steady on those rubber feet took more time to do than putting it together. Then, If I move the saw to use my router table I have to readajust it since my cement floor only looks completely smooth. so there's some back and forth issue with making the thing stable when it's moved and repositioned.
I'm not talking about cobblestone imperfection, it's subdle variations in concrete that make 4 wheels rock back and forth ever so slightly if they're not just right. Those 2 rubber feet have to take the weight of the saw and hold it steady or else if you push something heavy there's a chance the saw will move during your pushing. I don't want to have to follow my saw back and forth with shim stock. The nut and bolt type adjustment is tedious. I think Shop Fox has a heavier universal base that uses 2 feet but with large knob adjusters and also a thicker frame.
3 wheels always stay on the ground regardless of the slight imperfection which is what I've found on the one piece mobile base that's made specifically for individual equipment. I just put the one piece base on and forget it. Rolling circles to my hearts content around like a crazy merry-go-round. Stop and cut or route and back to where it once was, no problem. Cost twice as much, saved more than that cursing this univeral base.
I'm going to put this mobile base under my drill press which doesn't have to move, but only if it has too move, it will then be able too. I actually think the slight height increase would be worth it as well.",2.0
"I recently purchased 3 mobile bases.  After assembling the first one, I discovered that it's impossible for the base to provide a level support surface without all four wheels touching the floor, even on a level floor.  The side with the wheels on casters will always be higher than the side with the fixed wheels.  Furthermore, to get the side with the casters to the lowest point, the casters must be perpendicular to the base, which usually causes the base to move during it's final settling.  Since I was planning on using bases for a band saw and drill press, I wasn't thrilled with the prospect of having these tall machines installed on a surface that wasn't level.  I spoke with HTC technical support, and they said they recently replaced the plastic lever with aluminum, and the levelling issue was a known problem.  They offered the suggestion of grinding down the aluminum lever (perhaps this is something they should think about doing before selling it to the public?).  Another solution might be to use smaller casters.  In any case, I sent them all back.
Other than this problem, it seemed like an extremely solid and versatile unit, so if you don't mind the above issues you'll probably find these useful.",2.0
"Really overdue and much appreciate the levels no longer just rattling around to get damaged. However all closures are velcro which is fine but would have preferred the old style where all compartments zipped up securely.

"After reading all the reviews, I was expecting great things from this bit, especially given the price of it. For the first 65-75 holes, it performed flawlessly. I was boring down about an inch into seasoned Eucalyptus, so I took it slow, kept the bit cool, and ran it at around 850 rpms, based on everything I read.

But then something happened (I think it just got dull) and it started catching on the wood and spinning it out of our hands, no matter how tightly we gripped it. I thought at first it was just my wife's weak hands, so being the ""manly-man,"" I said, ""let me do it honey."" Well, not only did it rip it out of my hands, it left several nice gouges on the way - no stitches, but several band-aids. Luckily, since I was hurt, my wife didn't give me any grief. I had purchased a diamond sharpening kit from Rockler for just such a purpose, and tried to sharpen it, but didn't change the results. (Yes, I know now - ALWAYS wear gloves).

So I'm going to try to return/exchange this bit. Very disappointing. For the cost, I was hoping to get hundreds of holes out of it.",2.0
"A little background, I'm a professional woodworker, and run a production shop. I bought this bit based on the superior quality I've gotten out of other freud products. It was put to use on a busy drill press. Even though it cuts quick... the quality of the holes is horrible...right out of the box!!..tearing an ripping wood grain rather than slicing as it should. Leaving holes that are extremely, fuzzy, looking like they need a shave. Had to finish sand each hole causing lose of man hours and money. Plain old steel saw tooths cut better, even though you have to sharpen frequently.  Save your self the money and trouble!",2.0
"I make bed frames, production-style, for a living.  I drill lots of 1 inch diameter holes to countersink the bolt heads that hold the rails on so I figured that it would make sense to get a carbide Forstner bit since it would last practically forever compared to the regular steel bit I use.

I used this bit once and then put it away because it left a terrible, jagged edge on the hole and seemed to tear, rather than cut the wood fibers.  I'm giving it two stars because the wood I use is fir which is quite prone to having long fibers tear all over the place so it's likely that this bit works great with hardwoods and the like, but really, my regular steel Forstner bit cuts a MUCH cleaner hole than this fancy-pants carbide door stop.  Your mileage may vary.",2.0
Very slow cutting. Must be brought down very gently or will catch. Tended to loosen in the chuck.,2.0
"I bought this fan based on reviews that it was one the quietest of the field. Unfortunately, it hums and has a minor vibration., even with replacement motor and blade. I had to isolate the steel mounting tabs between two pieces of medium firmness packing foam, and then mount it with plywood over the foam, screwing it to the studs through the plywood making sure that the screws didn't touch the fan's mounting tabs. It is barely quiet enough so we are able to be in the master bathroom and bedroom that is below the fan.
It is sad that, with all of the technology we have, we cannot make a motor that doesn't hum and a a blade that is balanced.",2.0

Supposedly some people complained that they would LOSE the colored thingies and so Intermatic made a NEW timer that doesn't work.  When you set the built-in thingies, they're backward.  And the one we bought (suckers!) didn't even work backward.  The clock mechanism would go to ON and the light would go on, and then off in about 2 seconds.  We returned it.  Cannot find anything like the ""old"" fashioned ones.  We never lost the red and green extra thingies because we put them into a little plastic ""snack bag"" and into a drawer.

"We purchased three of these.  We needed some outdoor light fixtures in a hurry.  These were cheap enough that I felt we could replace them in a short time if we needed to.

We initially purchased one.  It worked fine for a few months so we went ahead and bought to more identical ones for the 2 additional fixtures that we needed.  About a week after we purchased the two additional ones and had them installed the first one started to go on the fritz.  One night the dog decided he needed to go out at 2 am. The light decided to essentially Blink. On and off...about every 5 seconds.  I swore it would stop. After about 15 minutes of watching it and worrying that it would bother one of our neighbors I finally went out to the garage and turned the switch off that it is attached to.

The timer on that light no longer really works.  It just stays on as long as it feels like it.  I haven't seen it do the ""blinking"" again, but it certainly doesn't stay on for the 10 minutes that I have selected.

The other two seem to be working fine so far, but I anticipate they will fail too in a short amount of time.  I feel like this item is a hit-or-miss item.  Its made poorly so some will be fine, and others will freak out.

If you're deciding between this one and a slightly more expensive one, I might spend the few extra bucks if you're looking for something that lasts.  I hoped ours would last at least the 6 months to a year that we required, but obviously that was asking too much.  I certainly won't be replacing it until the spring weather, so if it goes on the blink again, I might just try to live without it until the spring.  Our back yard is sort of a motion-light-mine-field so if the other two can pull through I think we'll be fine.",2.0
"Items arrived on time in good condition, the price was good, installation was easy, but setting the amount of time the light stays on does not work for me, and the sensor is inconsistent.

She rolled her eyes and went back inside. The lights will stay on for 1 minute when i set the time to one minute, but if i set to 5 or10 minutes the lights turn off after 10 seconds.

If you don't secure the tabs on the disc properly with a screwdriver, they fall off and it stops working. It drives my wife crazy.

"I purchased three in total, the AA battery provided is a POC, one leaked and the other died less than a year after purchasing. Overall I like the design and quality, however the AA battery should act as a backup to save your settings, instead, the battery serves as a function to power the device and store your settings, so in the event of battery failure/dying, you loose all your settings and now need to reprogram every time the batter is removed/dies. Kinda defeats the whole purpose of having a configurable timer.

Also to note, when the battery dies, you can't use the timer as it trips off every time.",2.0

"Bought this to replace an Intermatic Analog Water heater timer that lasted for 7 years before the trippers abraded the metal of the power rocker too much to function. (WH40 model) Incredibly easy to install,.

"These suspenders seem to be well made, with fairly heavy material and clips. They probably are good as work suspenders, where appearances aren't important.  But, that's not what I bought them for.

The front straps are not elastic, but some other material and the rear straps are elastic. The colors of the 2 materials are significantly different. The front straps are a much brighter shade of red than the rear straps.  I'd be much happier with them if all of the straps were the elastic material of the rear straps.

"Purchase unit for a 220vac 40 gal residential water heater around 01/21/13. I installed it but it did not function as designed and had to returned it for a replacement.

Since this is less than a year I filed a claim at Intermatic's  website, so lets see how that goes. Now I'm a retired Elect/Electronic Tech of 35yrs I have used similar timers by Paragon to control pumps, heaters and some small motors in Industrial applications. These timers have been in place in harsh and adverse conditions, some for more than 5yrs and are still functioning. None of them failed in the first 2yrs. I would certainly expect a timer with rated contacts for it's design purpose under residential conditions and used for it stated purpose to last a lot longer that a year and this one didn't make it a year.

"While I realize that Amazon wants a review the day you receive your merchandise, but I simply ignore it until I have a chance to actually try it. I give my first impression and about three months later I update my comment.

How can 50+ comments simply state that "" they mostly assume they'll be monthly savings, or hope there will be, or it should provide at least $7 per month based on one water heater which had an average of $13 per month which depending on how many people are in your home and the size of the water heater, that number could be much higher.

What I don't understand is WHY HAS NO ONE INSTALLED THE TIMER AND THEN AFTER A FULL BILLING CYCLE (WITH IT PROGRAMMED PROPERLY TO SHUT OFF WHEN NOT IN USE) HAS NO ONE ACTUALLY REPORTED THEIR SAVINGS ????????

If you are receiving daily or weekly emails from Amazon reminding you to rate the product, and you have no idea if it actually performs as described, how can you rate it?  Instead all 70 comments centered on the installation.  So 30% had no clue what the directions meant so they paid $50 for an electrician to install, thus it will be a year or more before they recover just the cost and installation of the unit.

Unless these timers are providing appreciable savings, it just like putting in new windows. Ten windows at $10,000 including installation.  You'll probably die before you recover the cost. Buying relatively cheap insulation and checking or replacing the seals etc. will accomplish at least $60% of your heat loss and if a window is particularly drafty, put up a $50 plastic inside cover. Check your electrical outlets against outside walls where cold air will stream in and install insulation for outlets about a 1 minute job. Or check into your attic insulation and basement insulation. If your home is 30 years old, chances are the R Value needs upgraded. Or look for places where the insulation has fallen and replace it. Another easy fix are hot water pipe wraps. How water copper pipes are normally running across your basement ceiling and the electric company will come in and give you those pipe wraps including a free energy assessment. Purchase an $18 hot water tank insulation wrap and finally, turn that thing down to about 120 at the most. When you go on vacation or away for a three day weekend, simply flip the breaker. When you come home, flip it back on and in no more than 20 minutes, its warm enough to take a shower.

I think I would rather spend that money and purchase the heat loss gun that identifies where cold air is coming in or heat is escaping. That unit, available on Amazon for around $30+ seems like it would pay for itself fairly quickly.

Sometimes its not about going green, but insulating your home.  So simple, anyone including a single Mom could do it. No heavy lifting----- Just plain old common sense.  And if you want to know why your electric keeps going up, it's most likely due to the tens of billions of dollars invested in green energy (at least 20 years too soon) which end up all going belly up or simply not yet ready to market. However, when men think they control the earth and the polar ice cap is melting away because of burning coal. our government puts tens of thousands out of work closing coal mines, forcing immediate conversions, and yet we are one little piece of the world where the majority of countries who currently produce 95% of America's products, can't consume enough oil, coal, or whatever else while our nation has outsourced almost everything and is now dependent on communist nations to provide everything from steel to scotch tape and with the wealth they've accumulated, they also control our financial infrastructure by buying up all the bonds put up for sale primarily due to a rapidly shrinking tax base because we no longer produce anything.",2.0

"I had an Intermatic ""Little Grey Box"" electronic water heater timer (WH40) for about ten years until it died, and I was satisfied with it.  To replace it when it died, I decided to buy a digital EH40 (instead of another WH40, which is still being sold).  The EH40 offers several advantages over the old WH40.  However, I am giving it low marks because of the very bad wiring instructions.  The company promotes the timer as easy to install, but in my experience it is not.  When you open the package, you find a card marked ""IMPORTANT! with a wiring diagram.  Naturally, a customer would assume a diagram marked ""IMPORTANT!"" should be used.  This diagram shows a jumper between terminals 1-5 and 2-3.  The jumpers that come with the timer are not long enough to go between terminals 1 and 5.  Elsewhere in the instructions, there is another diagram that is contradictory to the ""IMPORTANT!"" diagram, showing jumpers from terminals 1-3 and 2-5; the provided jumpers are long enough for this diagram.  This other diagram is the one to use, but the customer has to figure that out on his own.  This was very frustrating and time-consuming.  Adding to the difficulty for non-electricians, the diagrams are confusing because the electric lines and jumpers all look the same, instead of being distinguished with different colors or dashes v. solid lines or something like that.  And I could find no telephone number in the manual for customers to call (maybe it is there, but I could not find it); you have to find it on the Internet, and it is not toll-free.

Past customer reviews of this product have noted that the diagrams are contradictory; the jumpers are too short for the (incorrect) diagram; electricians had to be used; and people had to run to the store for supplies (to get a longer jumper, presumably).  Intermatic should pay attention to these comments, and make appropriate changes to the instructions.  Intermatic promotes this timer as easy to install.  It isn't, but it could be if Intermatic provided better instructions.",2.0

"I purchased this timer and installed it in May of 2010. It stopped working November of 2011, approximately 6 months after the warranty (12 month) expired. It was used on a 40 gallon water heater, and was set to operate for 2 hours in the Spring/Summer and 3-1/2 hours in the Fall/Winter.

Pros:

1. Fairly easy installation
2. A great big red manual override switch on the exterior enclosure for turning on your equipment/appliance at any time.
3. The operation times are easily set by manual timer throw switches.
4. It worked for 18 months!

Cons:

1. The timer is cheaply made, using a mechanical 24-hour timer, and constructed with plastic and stamped metal.
2. The manual override switch quickly loosened, requiring me to open the door to the enclosure to switch it on.
3. Brass throw connectors are used to supply power to your device as the timer engages. Unfortunately, these are held in place and moved by a cheap plastic assembly, which warped and separated the brass throw connectors enough where contact could not be made. (My timer was located in an attic in Austin, Texas, where summers are very warm)
4. There are a limited number of manual timer throw switches supplied (2-3 cycles per 24-hour period).
5. It worked for 18 months!

"Having purchased 3 of these units over the years I feel qualified to comment on their performance. The first one failed after 3 years - the clock mechanism still turned but the switches did not operate. I purchased a second unit as I did not want to install a new box & wiring. The box mounts to the wall first then the mechanism is installed inside. I only replaced the mechanism. This lasted for 2 years before the clock mechanism stopped turning. (I should have kept the first dead one.) Again I purchased another unit as wanted a simple fix & I will not be in this house for much longer. This last unit only lasted 2 weeks before the switches stopped operating. I did not want the hassle of dismounting & returning it so I stripped down both units & made good one out of the 2.
The mechanism is very old school & has not changed in years. The clock mechanism becomes very hot from being driven 24 hours/day. I does not appear to be adequate to drive the system contimually. I would recommend purchasing a modern electronic system.",2.0

"After getting my kitchen and bathroom counters replaced, I decided to do the new backsplashes myself, which necessitated getting some drywall spackling to repair the holes and scrapes from when the old backsplashes were removed.  Initially, I got a generic drywall spackle from the local ""HD"" store, and that worked pretty well.  However, I ran out with a couple of rooms left to do, so I ran out to the other big-box hardware store competitor ""L"" and found that DAP Vinyl Spackling was available for the same price as the generic, so I picked that up.  What a big mistake!

Unlike the generic, this vinyl spackling ran down the drywall like slowly melting ice cream.  It did fine on really small gouges, but if the damage was wide or deep, it didn't work as well as the generic.  It seems to be significantly wetter than the generic and this made it a problem.  It also really likes to stick to itself, but it doesn't seem to like sticking to the drywall.  So, I would apply it to the wall, then watched as it slowly oozed down the gouge, leaving a depression at the top of the gouge and a beer belly of spackling hanging off the bottom of the gouge.

Working it with a straight edge to get it flat was also a problem.  Again, it's okay for small gouges, but for anything deeper than 1/8"" or wider than an inch, I found that the straight edge tended to grab this spackle and pull it out of the hole or gouge.  Instead of a nice flat surface, I often either had the spackle pull out of the hole or make pointy spackle mountains.  Using a wet straight edge had its own problems, making the spackle even wetter so it would run faster out of the gouge.

The instructions say to use it above 50 degrees.  Well, I can't even recommend using it at any temperature.  Sure, it's spackle and yes, it's going to eventually cover the holes with repeated applications.  I'm sure it'll last a long time and is less likely to crumble compared to generic spackle.  But given the two different experiences I had today, where the generic stuff applied well, stuck to the drywall, and was way easier to work with, I cannot give this vinyl spackle more than two stars.

I really hate to rate it this low, because I've used and liked DAP products in the past.  But I can't let anyone else waste their time by using this stuff when the generic spackling works better.  From what I've read online, vinyl spackling is supposed to be for bigger and deeper gouges, but this stuff would require you to apply it in multiple coats to fill the gouge/hole.  Unless you specifically need vinyl spackling, I suggest staying with the generic drywall stuff which is easier to apply and less frustrating.",2.0

Thank goodness I had a 2x6 laying around too. Now I got that box in, mounted the fan over the hole using the ONLY LEFT side mounting bracket. OK Good to go....Hooked everything up and it came on. Sweet! It worked that night and the next morning. Around 11am my wife says ""hey babe, the light isn't working."" You gotta be kidding me. Maybe 6 flips of the switch?  No need to check the breaker as it is on the same line as the lights over my sink and they are on. I climb in the attic again. All wires and connections look good. Nothing is working. No light, No fan. I took it out and took it back. 2 and 1/2 hours of work down the drain.  I decided to replace it with a Hunter since this is what ceiling fans I have throught the house.

Pros: Takes a standard size light bulb, only one and no larger than 40 watts...I guess thats a pro?
It looks ok...Its plastic and there is a gap in the light cover that you can see the light through. Dont get too excited about it.

Cons: DIDN'T LAST A DAY
Only one way to mount it. If you are holding it with the wires coming in by you and the exhaust leading away from you, the bracket is on the left side and the holes are so high it has to be mounted to a 2x6 NO OPTIONS This can be a pain if you are replacing an exhaust fan that was mounted from the right side.
Pretty loud for 3.5 sones. I just replaced it with a 3.5 sones Hunter brand that is half as loud.

 After I put it in I was so tired and hot that I just ""accepted"" it as the new exhaust fan and hoped it worked even though I wasn't to happy about the cheap plastic look.  I would recommend to you to shop around and spend your hard earned cash elsewhere. If it worked it would be a cheap fix with a cheap look. Your call but I won't buy another one. I worked to hard and my time is worth too much to take this thing out literally the next day.
I hope this review helps and thank you for reading. Happy Shopping!!",2.0
Its loud.,2.0
The noise level is relative high from product label.,2.0
"**** Update, after it being installed for about a year, it is so loud I will be removing it.  I liked that it had some volume to it, to give more privacy to the washroom.  But it now rattles and vibrates so much you can feel it in the floor above and hear it from anywhere in the house. ****

This is an inexpensive unit, great price for a decent bathroom fan.

It is quite loud, much more than 2.5 sones I think.  Mine is not vibrating, just loud.

It moves more air than I thought it would, which is good.

It has tabs on only one side for mounting it to a joist.  You do need access from above OR extra room on either side of the fan (cut out large drywall section or new construction).

I was replacing an older fan and had to cut 2-3"" on either side wider than this fan is so I could reach up and screw the tabs to the joist.  Then I had to do drywall patching to cover up the open sides.",2.0
"I was very happy with the Broan 679 Fan I bought several years ago from Amazon.  It eventually stopped working from all the dust and dirt it had sucked into the motor over the years (I never cleaned it), so I bought the same model again as a replacement because the previous fan performed well and an identical fan would be easier to install than one with different dimensions.  However, the Broan 679 that I recently purchased is very, very loud.  Much louder than the one it replaced.  I had read some recent reviews complaining about a vibrating loud noise with this fan, but I ignored them thinking they installed them incorrectly.  I installed this one the same as the identical fan it replaced.  I think there may be some quality problems with the more recently made fans.  I regret buying this recent Broan 679 fan and would have preferred purchasing another brand or model, even if it would have been more difficult for me to install.",2.0
Not as quiet as I thought and requires new plug and twist bulbs which are more expensive. They look kind of cheap. Not what I expected,2.0
"I normally don't leave negative reviews and this product works just fine but I have a problem with items not being exactly as they are advertised.  It states clearly in the product description that this unit includes a 7W nightlight, and after opening the package and examining it (and instructions) carefully, it most certainly does not.

I would suggest removing that feature from the product description.",2.0
"I was more concerned about purchasing a unit that cleared the bathroom of moisture (unlike our cheap builder-grade unit installed when the house was built over 20 years ago) than noise. Well, the fan clears the bathroom of moisture, but the noise is unbearable. It's not only loud, it's got a high pitch/tone. I'm going to have to try to eliminate the noise as other reviewers have done or return it.",2.0
"I chose this fan/light unit because I was replacing one just like it. The unit does what it's supposed to, but the installation is especially difficult as a replacement unit. The problems started with the simple (once you've done it) removal of the lens. Then to remove the base, you have to remove the light bulb, and then loosen the bolt that holds the light 'fixture' to the fan unit. The base frame is held up by simply resting on the light fixture, and tension can be adjusted by tightening or loosening the bolt holding the light fixture to the fan unit. Then you can deal with how the unit is held in place. A nail was holding mine!! The new one is in the same position, but I've used two 1/2 "" hex head screw to hold it in place.

When i took the old unit down, a lot of that cellulose insulation in the attic came with it. Not pleasant. I had tried to clear it away by getting to the unit from the attic side, but if the unit is installed poorly, as mine was, it is probably nearly impossible not to have some insulation fall.

Next was the wiring. Wiring is a place where the unit could be a lot more 'user friendly'. Why have some kind of 'knockout' when there could easily be a plug attachment on the outside of the unit that would fit a plug-in device the installer could attach to the wires feeding the unit!

So, now it's installed and attached. It is what it is, and I really think it's c..p, but it does vent",2.0
I'm not sure what the problem is but now the light and fan don't operate. Ive checked the breakers not the problem.,2.0
This is a replacement fan for the one that was so noisy you could hear it blocks away.  I still think that it is too noisy but at least it is tolerable.,2.0
"Three of these models were installed in our house when it was built.  One fan lasted less than 2 years, one lasted less than 7 years, and the third still works.  They do move some air, but do you really want to replace your ceiling exhaust fan every few years?",2.0
"didn't buy this from Amazon, but it's the same model. I guess ""economy line"" should have raised a flag, but only after one day of working I found out that the motor is noisy, it puts too much vibration in the wood beams, and the plastic faceplate is so flimsy it sometimes vibrates in a different pitch than the rest of the thing. Next time I'll give the replacement a dry run before spending my time installing it..",2.0
I would have given this product more stars but I was missing galvanized steel crank handle.  Normal I would have returned the item and requested for a new one to be shipped to me but I have already been without a kitchen sink for over a week and decided to just use it as it is.  When I received the package the box had not been opened or damaged in any way but when I opened the box I noticed that the packaged that the drain auger comes it was opened and the crank was missing.  I am figure that this happened when they were packing the box or at some other point in the warehouse.  You can surely use the item with out the crank but your hands will show for it later.,2.0
The handle sucks  it does a bad job of twisting the snake.,2.0
"Worked ok. Used once, dried it as well as possible and then put it down. Even with wiping it down, it was rusted within half an hour. Kind of shocking. Plus, the ""carrying case"" is just the plastic container it comes in.",2.0
"The picture here on Amazon is inadequate, so there was no way of knowing that the ""auger head"" end of the cable would actually be 3/8"". So if your drain trap allows only a 1/4"" cable, you can't use this auger unless you want to use the less effective other end of the cable.

Next, augers aren't easy to use when it comes time to negotiate a 90-degree turn if there's also another path straight ahead (e.g. double sink). Call it luck or experience; you'll need one or the other if in this situation. I gave up after a couple hours at it. Maybe it would have gone better if the only path was the 90-degree turn.

Also, the ""reusable storage tote"" is silly: the auger comes in the kind of hard plastic shell that's notoriously difficult to open. If you're really careful, sure, it won't be mangled to the point that it's unusable, but it probably will be. And in no way, shape, or form can it be called a ""tote.""

And finally, the handle is hardly revolutionary: you grip the lower black plastic handle with one hand and then use your other hand to laboriously rotate the metal center piece (all the while the thumbscrew will be getting in your way). While doing this, 13' of cable is flopping on the floor behind you. I had assumed that the torque motion would be something a little more sophisticated than this, but no.",2.0
This is really just a gimmick.  Due to its size it does not give good indication of level for a long post.  I would rather use a 3ft level and get a truer reading.,2.0
"Quality American made product. Precision craftsmanship, quality steel. Youve got to handle one to understand why its superior to stainless foreign made products.



Update:  After ordering my first Case, here on Amazon,  I was so happy with it I ordered another. However, two of the blades rubbed together and were scratched right out of the box so I sent for a replacement. Sadly, the replacement did the same thing  and it didn't even have a good edge on the blade. After reading some of the other reviews here on Amazon, it seems I am not the only one who has experienced this problem with these knives. Very disappointing. When I get it right its a very nice (5 stars) knife though.",2.0
"Bought the yellow CV med. Stockman with punch blade.  Main California clip blade is lame, just disappointingly small. This knife is 3-5/8"" closed but the main blade is smaller than the clip blade on my mini trapper that is 3-1/2"" closed.  This is a nice enough knife but the main blade absolutely fails to inspire confidence.  It's skinny like a filet blade but not long enough to filet anything bigger than a goldfish.  Try again Case. Will be returning this knife.",2.0
I liked that it had 2 on/off times you could set but the timer did not last long.,2.0
This timer has an obvious design flaw. The little plastic trippers are removable therefore can be lost. I recommend other timers which have trippers that are not removable. Intermatic does sell replacement trippers but the cost is almost as much as a new unit.,2.0
"Nice knife.  Really like the punch blade.

Update - I bought this knife in July and now, 3 months later, the blades are badly tarnished, dark blotches that look like rust.  The old Stockman I lost and replaced was used for years in the same manner as this one and I never had issues with it.  I won't buy another chrome vanadium knife.",2.0
"Bad quality, the case emblem fell off immediately after removing it from the box. The white bone design on the handle looks like cheap plastic. Blades are in good shape and it pow s and closes fine but the beauty of these knives is half the reason to buy and this one is certainly lacking in beauty.",2.0
"The device surves its purpose, it turns on my lamp, it turns off my lamp - no big deal. Only problem I am facing right now is that it is useless without the pins... yes, loosing the pins that flips the switch makes this device a paper weight... So don't loose the pins like I did.",2.0
"I ordered lamp AND APPLIANCE TIMER, AN UPGRADE FROM THE lamp timer (NOT FOR APPLIANCES ALSO) YOU SENT. You should have enought experience to be able to send what you show/advertise.",2.0
"Steel is quality, but fit and finish is really lacking. My knife came with the sheepsfoot blade bent to make space for the spey point blade and the blades have scuff marks from where they rub together.

I bought this knife thinking it would blow my Schrade 8OT out of the water and I'm sad to say it didn't. Pretty disappointing.",2.0
"The screws that came with the unit seemed very cheap.  I have been doing carpentry work for years, so I think I know how how screws work...but these screws seemed to strip out incredibly easy.  The magnet is powerful and this would be a 5 star product with some 2 cent screws instead of 1 cent ones.",2.0
Magnets are good and strong but screws are very cheap and strip easily.,2.0
Every screw broke not just one but all. It works fine after we supplied our own wood screws keeping our unruly cabinet closed. If u purchase I hope u have a good supplies of screws on hand,2.0
"The magnet it's OK, the price is also OK, but the screws that come with this thing are made of extremely soft metal, and they get damaged when screwed into wood. It's a tiny screw with a flat head - not easy to find a replacement that would fit.
I did pre-drill holes for them, and even being very careful with a screwdriver, I wasted 3 screws before finally being able to
install this thing. Kitchen cabinets are usually made of really hard wood/board, not a drywall!",2.0
"Knife appears well made and beautifully finished, but the blades rub so badly that the clip blade is difficult to close.  I have not sent this problem in my other stockmans.",2.0
Not that great. Filters hard to find.,2.0
"Great filter, great price Cheap plastic fittings that leak",2.0
"BEWARE -- I purchased one of these knives, and it was delivered with a sizable scrape on the middle blade.  When I spoke to the Case dealer I was told that ALL Case knives that have a setup where blades share a ""well"" like this 3 blade Stockman and other similar knives will have this scrape.  It is very noticeable and looks like the knife has been damaged.  Unfortunately, no one states that in the description of this knife or shows a photo of it. The Case dealer I spoke with said that he has had to explain this to hundreds of customers that he has shipped this and similar knives to over the years. For some reason, he had never thought to document this with words and photos so that the customer is aware before they purchase.",2.0
"The product worked wonderfully and the water tasted great but, like one of the other reviewers, the plastic connector ring got a small crack in it and now will not hold the unit on to the faucet. Perhaps the weight of the unit it too much for the arched faucet we have and the cheap plastic ring. At least make it easy to order a replacement ring or two....",2.0
The jaws don't line up perfectly,2.0
This knife was not up to Case standards- blades were not finished well and rubbed. I returned it.,2.0
Water filter unit did not properly fit our exesting faucet.  provided attachments were not snug and the pressure pushed the entire unit off the faucet head.  Tried several variations of the inclulded attachments but all ended in frustration.  Went to COSTCO instead and found a PUR for the same price.,2.0
"You absolutely cannot move the unit once you put it on or it wears the plastic piece out very easily.  We used plumbers tape around the threads and ours has not come off since.  You absolutely again can not move the unit once it is attached, so put it in the best position for all to use.  Ours is now at two months shy of a year and has begun to drip/leak through the filter hole when the regular faucet is turned on and sputter when turned to filter.  Filter is only 1 1/2 mo old and just two of us using it, only for drinking water and dog bowl once a day.  Really liked it over the two PUR ones we used for the last several years, filters are a lot more economical.  Company needs to put a little more into the attachment, I'd pay the extra $10 for the better unit, for sure.",2.0
"We've tried Brita, Pur, and finally Instapure - all of them have the same design flaws. While I can't say enough nice things about Instapure's customer service (they offer a lifetime warranty and will ship you replacement parts when requested), I find the need to rely on them as often as every few months indicative of a design flaw in this product type. As a result, I cannot recommend any brand of faucet-mounted filter system.

The Brita's reminder to replace light eventually stopped working and the water pressure through the filter was gradually reduced to a trickle. Replacing the filter and cleaning the base did not resolve this. The same behavior affected the Pur on-tap device. The Instapure one eventually had the same issue, and also kept popping off the faucet as the plastic threads would weaken with time. Turning the knob to switch from regular water to filtered water results in a stream of water emitting from both water nozzles now. Either way we turn it, water streams out of both ports. This means hot water is being funneled through the filter (a no-no!) as well. I live near Seattle WA, and our water is not normally problematic.

We've since switched to using a Brita pitcher. It's a bit heavy (10 cups when filled), but the positive point to consider is the water path simply goes right through the filter as gravity pulls it down. We also have the added benefit of the water being ice cold, if refrigerated.",2.0
The metal holding is all bent and scratched,2.0
Not as good as the ones you can get at a crafts store or even Walmart. Saw some at Walmart for a better deal. The plastic inside does not go all the way to the tip.,2.0
This only works for the old fashion faucets with threads on the end. I had to return this model as I could not connect it.,2.0
No me sirvi,2.0
"The installation was pretty problem free.  The water flow is good when fully
connected and the design is sleek.
There is one major problem and that it that the filter will not stay connected.  The
screw well is too shallow to hold the filter securely.  The water pressure from the sink
is enough the blow this filter completely off.  I find myself re-attaching the filter at least
four to five times daily.  Lately I've just decided to leave it off since I seem to waste so
much time re-attaching it to the faucet.  That being said, I find it's more difficult to use
that it's worth.  I would buy this one again.",2.0
"It did not fit the Shop Vac I have, although it was listed as fitting.  It is too small for the 90304 filter.",2.0
"Product leaks at the faucet connection.  Tried to unattach/reattach numerous times, flipping washer, etc.",2.0
"I really wanted to purchase a BRITA filter since I've heard they're the best. However after reading the reviews I decided not to since the ones for Teledyne were much better, and I am kicking myself for ever thinking that. This filter did hook up to my sink it did fit and attach but the process wasn't easy, you had to hold one part while screwing in another and then attaching in another, it was very awkward and extremely frustrating. The filter isn't chrome as listed it's plastic and I have found that it's also extremely flimsy as well.

My biggest issue is that it leaks from all areas. I have un-attached & re-attached at least a half a dozen times and it still leaks, I have the filter hooked up correctly and I also have the correct size washer in there, overall it's just a very cheap and a flimsy made product that soaks my entire kitchen.

I purchased a BRITA for my bathroom faucet and it works amazing, I will have to suck up the loss on this Teledyne and purchase a BRITA for the kitchen as well, why I thought this would be better is beyond me. Good luck if you purchase this.",2.0
"Very poor quality control.  The sheepfoot blade rubs the other two, causing visible scratches on the other two blades.  Because the sheepfoot is too wide, there is a visible gap between the side metal scale and the cutout metal scale..

The edges of the blades aren't straight.  When I look at the blade edge-up, the cutting edge waves to the left and right.  The edge isn't centered or even consistent.  To make things worse, the edges have chips in them that make the knives more like little serrated blades than a straight-edge knife.",2.0

"Ok, from reading the reviews on this filter I thought I was getting 6 filters????  package arrived today and only had two filters in it....not sure if more are coming but I doubt it.....$15 a filter is high I believe.

"The design of this unit at first had me inpressed. It is VERY straight forward and simple. The putty ring at the bottom is designed to fit a mutitude of toilet rings in a variety of materials.

I had this thing installed in 3 minutes! Very happy! but why 2 stars??

Well, after about 30 flushes the seal does not hold and the unit runs full open all day long! A quick re-seat of the putty rings works for only a day or two. I am in the tank every day. Replacing this thing tonight.

So 1 Star for a good idea, 1 star for not ripping me off....but get a better system for attachment.

I would not recommend this.",2.0
"i love this knife. i carry it with me everywhere and use it almost daily- both at work and at home. the blades have held their edge well and are easy to sharpen. Case makes a good quality knife, my father an grandfather have carried case knives their whole lives and swear by them.

Edited to add that after about a year the blades are pitting and corroding, just from normal use and being in my pocket every day.

"I replaced 8 different types of non-Korkey plumbing fill and shutoff valves all with Korkeys. The design is sleek, simple and colorful. Unfortunately, with a total of 8 toilet Korkey replacements the Korkey shutoff mechanism deteriorated in 4 of these toilets in less than 2-3 years. Yes, there is a five year warranty and yes there is a free replacement, but the slow leak at the shutoff diaphragm means water bills creep up as water flows into the tank and over the upright overflow tube . Three of the eight toilets each were refurbished with new Korkey and two of these failed within less than 2 years. I have switched to Fluidmaster.",2.0
"Bought this kit in order to attempt to repair an older Eljer ""Touch Flush"" toilet.  The style of the Eljer uses a plastic bracket mounted to the tank bolt in order to secure the flapper.  This mount had snapped, and in order to attempt to repair this toilet *without* removing the tank, I purchased this kit.  The kit installed fine.  I cleaned the surfaces as directed and the parts adhered without issue.  However, after a month of regular use, the seal began to leak.  I do not use any chemicals in the bowl of the tank, but rather it appears the act of flushing the toilet was enough to break the seal.  This may be an issue with the design of these older Eljer toilets and the amount of water pressure against the flapper.  Regardless, the seal did not hold up.  I have discarded this kit and removed the tank to install a new Eljer mount/flapper.",2.0

"The main reason for the 2 star rating is that the knife I received was mechanically flawed.  The two smaller blades closed on top of each other.  You could close either one first then when the second one is closed it's cutting edge came to rest on the back edge of the first one closed.  To get the second blade to close completely I had to push it to the side off of the back edge of the other blade.  A great brand name, but a poor Quality knife.",2.0
"Be aware that the fill valve height lock/adjust system can loosen itself and migrate CCW into the UNLOCKED position unexpectedly. This will cause the entire valve to PUNCH upward with force enough to lift and throw off the lid.

Walked into the bath this morning only to see what you see in the picture, with water running full force overflowing down the overflow tube. No flooding, thankfully.

After I put it all back together, I spent some time analyzing the cause.

I observed a moderate ""shake"" when the valve closes after filling the tank. There is motion over the entire valve assembly. This shake, over time, PLUS any, and I mean ANY small 'pull' in the CCW (counter-clockwise) direction put on it by the refill tube will result in CCW rotation. Enough flushes, and this small pull will eventually twist the unit CCW into the unlocked position.
At the instant that happens, the fill valve will extend suddenly and forcefully into it's fully extended range of adjustment. It's forceful enough to move the tank lid, as you can see.

So be very careful during installation. Make sure your unit if fully locked CW (Clockwise) when installed without any CCW tension being put on it by that stiff refill tube.",2.0

"My experience was that it worked for about 7 months and then it began to exhibit the same symptom that everyone keeps describing, it does not stop flowing, rather than immediately give it a bad review I decided to go on the Korky website to use their troubleshooting tips, after trying every solution suggested with the same result of not working, I gave it a gentle wrap with the tip of my knuckles, no joke, it split in HALF and shot water all over the wall and floor, this is a cheaply made, poor performing item and not well engineered, maybe in the future they might come out with something good, avoid THIS piece of crap!",2.0

"Korky 528 Korky Quiet Fill Toilet Fill Valve...  I purchased two Korky Quiet Fill toilet valves on June 30, 2015 from Amazon to replace a similar valve I had purchased at Home Depot, which lasted for approximately one year.  It said on the package the unit was guaranteed for 5 years, but that is not true, this product does not last for five years.  However, it is quiet and does install easily and costs less then $10, so, I bought 2 more after the first unit failed.  My thinking was this; I would have a spare unit if the new unit I installed didn't last.  It didn't last!  The newly installed unit lasted for 8 months and then started slowly leaking and there was nothing to be done about the leak, so I installed the spare (the third one I have installed), which I expect will not last much beyond perhaps one year.  However, because these units are cheap and easy to install I will continue to purchase them, but I will always have a spare ready to go.  Make sure if you buy these valves you monitor the valve's performance after several months because a slowly leaking toilet can cost you a gigantic water bill the following month.  Think of it the toilet slowly leaking 24-7... the water going directly into the sewer.",2.0
"The filters showed up crushed on one side but they are still usable. So although not satisfied, they seem to work ok.",2.0
"Easy and quick to install and adjust, but from the first flush I could see a steady stream of water flowing down from the top of the valve body as it fills, which just doesn't seem right. I've not seen this on any of the Fluidmasters I've used. Also, this valve didn't seem to be noticeably quieter than other brands I've used. As a final note, I immediately noticed this valve has a 'hard' abrupt shut off when the tank is filled, which can cause banging in the pipes of older homes or those with high water pressure. I'm beginning to experience this in my home, and the Korky caused a significant banging when shutting off...which I've not experienced with Fluidmasters that have a softer, more progressive shut-off. So I decided to stick with the good 'ol Fluidmaster brand I've used for years and installed a new one. No pipes banging, no dripping/flowing water from the valve top when filling, and for some reason, I feel more secure when leaving my home.",2.0
"I got 2 TOTO toilets and been happy ""everyday customer"" for about 12 years :))) -I could admit that original fill valve will start failing after 6-7 years.

Not the savings of $5-10, but rather availability of Korky replacement at local store made me give Korky a chance.
Here is my notes:
PROS.
-installation is very easy (as with original)
-maybe it is a little quieter
-it works out of the box.

CONS:
only one- it started failing after a little more then a year.
Every once in a while It would just not fill tank. To get it going you gotta open tank, fiddle with float and hope for the best. Which could be very nerve wracking if something already floats underneath :)

Bottom line:
Even though some people claim that Korky is just as good as toto, my not so scientific experimenting says otherwise.
I would stick to original as saving on $ and time is not really worth it.

"I was going to start this review with ""more junk from China""; thought I had better verify - whoops, made in USA.  Hmmmm. Well, I think the product is near-junk status, it is no quieter than the original valve and water drips out of valve body when filling.  That doesn't make any difference because it is going in the tank, but still makes you wonder about the quality of it.  If you do buy it, it helps to put the plastic tube that fits into the siphon tube in to fairly hot water so the tube will soften and more easily fit onto the valve body.  The good part -- it didn't cost very much. And installation is straightforward.",2.0
"I went by the reviews online and purchased one. I thought this was going to be an easy project, but it turned out to be hell. I am not a plumber or know how to fix things, I went by the reviews again. The bolt and nut do not fit, although it says universal. I had to hunt and buy the bold extra. The washer the goes under the tank that connects to the toilet is big, doe not fit my tank, again it says universal, I had to buy extra. I would not recommend this. Get the fluidmaster",2.0
"Was talked into this by sales lady, what a mistake.  Gaskets instructions warn not to over tighten but if you don't crank the crap out of them it leaks.  Instructions average at best.

"I had a toilet that made lots of noise when refilling due to high pressure.  I purchased the Korky fill valve because of its advertised quiet filling.  While I was initially pleased that the Korky was very quiet and filled quickly, the first valve started to leak in less than two years and required replacement.  I wanted to give it another try, so I purchased the second Korky as the next replacement.  This one also failed in less than two years because it went through about 6 to 8 ""very noisy"" on / off  cycles during each filling.  I replaced it this time with a Fluidmaster which is performing well so far and is also reasonably quiet.  I'm finished with the Korky and recommend against buying it unless you really like plumbing work.",2.0
"I had a old Fluidmaster for years -- worked fine.  Bought a new toilet and this valve is a bit quieter, but it stopped working after about one year.  Tried the repair suggested by the video, but it failed again.  Waste of my time to worry about whether a toilet is going to flush.  Going back to a tried and true valve.",2.0
"I've installed two of these.  One ""sings"" and the flap cover doesn't seal properly half the time I flush it.  The other one has begin to stop the water flow about a 1/4 of the way to filling the toilette so the toilette can't flush.  I'm looking for an alternative, as these are not worth the money.",2.0
"Not that easy of an install, because it's tricky to adjust the water level.  At first the toilet wouldn't refill, so I did a google search to try to trouble search and found someone who said their's (a different brand) wouldn't refill in the locked position.  So I unlocked the valve and now it's refilling, thankfully.  But all this took a little while to figure out, about 45 min. - 1 hour to replace and get it to work.  Hopefully, the 'unlocked' status of the valve doesn't cause any future problems.  Oh, and it doesn't seem that quiet either.  You get what you pay for, I guess.",2.0

"I hate to say it, but I was terribly disappointed in this knife.
First the good: Case's chestnut bone is beautiful. Size and weight of this knife are very nice. It seemed like it would be very carriable. Blades came very sharp. Honestly, this knife is lovely, and I really wanted to like it.
However, the bad: the blades rubbed so badly that they would literally not close. The main clip caught so badly on the sheepsfoot that there was a gash in the side of blade, and I had to force it closed. I know a little blade rub is common on stockmans, but this was ridiculous.
I returned it within a day, and opted for a Case two-blade jack.",2.0
"I purchased this for my birthday.  I have always used the cheap, chinese made pocket knives sold at the hardware store and have wondered if I was missing out.  Now I can be assured that I am not.  I was severely disappointed by the quality of this knife.  I have about 6 cheap knives in my drawer and this one is second to only one of them in order of poor fit and finish.  Sure, the scales look good, that is where the positive really ends.  The blades rub together so that after opening each blade two or three times there are scratches on all blades.  The small pen blade can not even be opened because it catches on the nail notch of the sheep's foot blade.  On the two larger blades the spring does not fully sit flush when the blades are opened.  There are gaps.  All edges are rounded off in the lock up.  It came dull (unable to cut paper).  Above all else, I judge this knife on the essence of being a knife.  The blades were all ground uneven both front to back and at completely, visibly, different angles on each side of the blade, which makes this kind of a knife severely frustrating to put an edge on because unless I reset the entire bevel I have to change angles on the stone for each side of the blade.  There is wiggle room side to side on the blades.  My 12 dollar Frost Steel Warrior puts this knife to shame.  I really really wanted to like this knife.  I even had a dream about it as I waited for it to come in the mail.  I wanted to be proud to have another knife made by Americans. I would not have been so disappointed if there wasn't so much hype about 'American Craftsmanship' in this brand of knife.  Anyone who claims this knife comes razor sharp and is a true example of a fine knife needs to hold a real knife and maybe pick up a razor sometime as these things are not present in this product.  I might have just received the bottom of the barrel but I am not about to invest any more time or energy in this knife or in Case products.

Just to be sure the leak was not coming from somewhere else, I turned off the water, took some additional water out of the tank, but not all, left maybe a centimeter deep, and lo and behold, no leaking.

UPDATE: About 1.5 years in and the 2nd of two is dead now as well, although this one failed to the ON state, meaning that the lights stay on 24x7 regardless of motion, daylight, or the lack thereof.  Adjusting the sensitivity has no effect.  So yeah... not recommended unless you enjoy replacing these things every year or two.",2.0
"I bought this SL-5412 motion sensor security light about three years ago. I bought it in Home Depot. I installed it under the deck, where it was protected from the rain by the deck itself; this minimized the possibility of water damage. When I installed it, I immediately discovered that the coverage angle is 90 degrees rather than 150 degrees and that the range is 30 feet rather than 70 feet (at maximum sensitivity). The unit worked for about three years, but recently it died for no obvious reason. The part that died is the motion sensor. The lights are off during the daytime, but during the night they are permanently turned on, regardless of whether there is motion or not. I tried to decrease the sensitivity to the minimum, but the lights still did not turn off. Then I took the motion sensor apart to see whether there was water inside the box. To my surprise, it was completely clean and dry inside the motion sensor box and also inside the bid round box on which the unit was hanged. The printed circuit board looks like new, with no traces of water damage or even dust. This means that after about three years of use the circuit will die even if it is dry. The reason is: DESA International uses cheap electronic components (specifically, cheap electrolytic capacitors) that do not last more than a couple of years.",2.0

This fixture does not accommodate compact fluorescent flood light bulbs without removing the shades!!!  These bulbs are wider above the screw threads than normal flood bulbs and this section does not fit through the opening in the shade making it unable to reach the socket threads.  You have to remove the shades if you want to use compact fluorescents.,2.0
"We had one of these for about a year, and it died.  The motion sensor was the culprit.
I replaced the sensor & did a postmortem on the dead one.  Egads, judging by the algae at the bottom of the sensor there was about 1 inch of water retained inside the case for a significant period of time.  The bottom part of the circuit board was disgusting.
Judging from the case construction, the water got in via the 'lip' which is formed by the back of the case joining the front.  There was no gasket around the lip, nor sealant around the entire perimeter, etc.
...furthermore, the adjustment controls are assuredly not waterproof.
Yet, to be fair, one could not build that circuit for that price.  It is just the absence of a sealed case & rust proof screws which prevents the heath zenith from being a solid product.  Desa handles the Heath Zenith stuff these days.
I live in Ohio, with a real winter, spring & summer - which may have contributed to the sensor's early demise.  Caveat Emptor!",2.0

Was not happy with this purchase. Universal fit is not accurate. I bought a 3 pack as a replacement as my flappers on both toilets have bent a little over time... likely due to chemical additives and usage etc. After I installed one you could tell it doesn't seat in the middle of the tank drain after a flush and subsequently there was still a leak. Made a different brand purchase that I remember making before that was truly universal and fixed the issue. I do not recommend.,2.0

"Pros: It works for general ripping, lightweight, straighter than using some random 2x4 as a guide.

Cons: Flimsy; too thin, easy to break.

Alternatives to product: L-channel metal piece $5-10 or use a spare Level as a guide [$20 72"" at Harbor Freight].

Extra info.
I used this aluminium device to rip several 8 ft. decking boards; it worked. I had to be careful no to clamp too tightly. The device is very flimsy when it is used as an 8 ft piece. It will bend and warp under it's own weight if picked up by one end. I returned it the next day because it would just get ruined soon.

Maybe you could keep it safe if your careful, but then ripping becomes a slow job; since it is so easy to damage this particular guide.

Because I still needed some type of straight edge, I purchased a 6 foot [1/16th or 1/8th inch steel] L-Shaped metal channel. Which worked as well. They run about $5-$10; check through metal channels for the straightest. Probably not accurate enough for finish work, but it worked for me.

Btw, L-channel and metal pieces are usually found with the nuts and bolts, sheet metal, or welding supplies at hardware stores. Farm stores like tractor supply or Orschel should have them as will.",2.0
"I have used this guide often for ripping sheet stock with a circular saw.  However, do not expect accurate cuts from this, especially when you are making 8' rips.  The guide flexes WAY too much toward the middle.  It has little to do with the connector.  The guide is just not substantial enough to resist flexing.  If you put any pressure against it with your circular saw (as one tends to do when using a tool guide), you will have a cut that bows outward in the middle on one piece, and concave on the other piece.

I have recently retired this guide for more expensive and more substantial all-in-one clamp and tool guides that do not flex.

Bottom line, if all you need is a quick and rough cut, this is a handy tool.  But if you demand a straight cut, pay more money and get a tool guide that resists flexing.",2.0
"I have some old toilets, approximately 8 years old. They were probably the cheapest units the builder could install, and rather than a chain, had this strip of plastic which is starting to deteriorate. The downstairs one broke, and I had a Korky repair kit on hand so I took the flapper out of the kit and installed it, and it worked perfectly. No leaks. I was impressed.

So I figured I'd order this three pack (which appears in every respect to be identical to the one that came out of the Korky kit) and preemptively replace the other original toilet flappers before they too rotted away. All the toilets in the house are the same model. Unfortunately, what I have now is two toilets with slow leaks. About a half inch of tank capacity in ten minutes. I've checked the mating surface on the bottom of the tank, it's fine -- no nicks, no roughness, no deposits of crud. I can pull the new Korky flappers out and put the old ones back in and the leak stops. These flappers turned non-leaky toilets into a leaky ones. An unfortunate waste of time.",2.0

"Filters this size are hard to find. When i saw a 6-pack, I was VERY happy to purchase - and the price was GREAT!  but only 1 filter was in the box.  i wanted to return it but the shipping cost, etc... Plus i really needed the filter.  I am VERY disappointed in the false advertising.  :(",2.0

The last 2 filters were totally collapsed, to where I could not slide them out! Makes me wonder for how long these had been sitting in my furnace collapsed/damaged like this! It seems to me that 3M has significantly cheapened the quality and reinforcement ability of these filters. Shame on them! I will be looking elsewhere.",2.0
"The folding part of  this rule is reasonably well made.  But the reason to have it is the brass extension slide.  In the sample I got, the slide arrived jammed.  Even after un-jamming it, it doesn't extend when the rule is open.  When the rule is closed, it extends only with great difficulty.  The only way to get it to extend reliably is to half-fold the segment on the end, so the joint is at 90 degrees.  Then the slide will extend.

To add insult to injury, once the slide extends, it is loose enough that it will not hold its own weight against gravity.  So you can use it to measure only horizontal distances.

My father always used a folding rule instead of a tape measure.  At this price, I was hoping to get a tool of reasonable quality.  Instead I got junk.  Do not buy.",2.0

"These specific 3M filters, though good at filtering micron-size particles, do too great of a job.  Our fan's motor had burnt out so we had to spend beaucoup bucks for an HVAC repairman to replace it.  He told us that he has replaced other fans like ours in homes whose owners use the higher-MERV-rated filters. Apparently, the resistance is too great, causing the fan to wear prematurely.  He recommended the cheaper style filters that allow the air to pass more easily. We followed his advice, and the fan sounds less stressed and we've had no problems in past 4 yrs now.",2.0

"They are made sturdy, but are poorly designed.  First of all, the cabinet door half of the hinge, is supposed to seat inside a cutout on the base.  In reality, it does not, so the hinges mount your door so far out from the frame of the cabinets, that you can actually see inside the cabinet from a 45 degree angle.

Additionally, they give you 3 decorative face screws  for the part that mounts to the cabinet.  This is bad, because if you already had hinges, they were probably mounting screws, so the new decorative screws are too small for the holes.  There is no reason whatsoever to have decorative screws as they are inside the cabinet.  Also, they bump the cabinet doors 1/8 of an inch in further, so if you have cabinet doors that meet in the middle they will probably hit, and there is a good chance your door won't fit in the opening without cutting insets into the doors for every hinge.

Also, it should be noted that this is a satin chrome finish, NOT satin nickel.  Chrome is of course a nickel alloy so I suppose in all technicality it is correct, but these do not match what most people consider a satin nickel finish in the modern hardware market.  If you have brushed nickel handles these won't match very well.

It is too bad, there are very few options out there for retroactively outfitting 3/8 inset cabinet doors.  This is a poor option.  If you want something more discreet look into knife cut hinges.",2.0

In any case, this flashlight has been a disappointment and I would not recommend spending your money on it.",2.0
"I purchased this light from a battery supply store when I ordered batteries in bulk thinking, heck, it's a Maglite so it must be good. Most of my lights are this brand for the obvious reasons already stated in other reviews.  However, I am a bit disappointed in the 2 C light.

Right out of the package I found the focus not to work properly, the bulb was installed crooked, which believe it or not, made the light almost useless (it's not held in place by much on this light) and the lens cover was loose. Upon disassembly, I pushed the bulb back to center although I'm uncertain how long it will stay that way, one drop on the floor will probably return it to its former position. The loose lens cover was due to it being assembled upside down, the ridge that is supposed to seal against the gasket was facing the wrong way leaving a gap which would have allowed water to run into it. Additionally, the ""focus"" adjustment is a cheap piece of plastic tubing cut at an angle on one end allowing the lens to bob up and down. I admit, my two year old ""D"" cell has this same mechanism, however, it works much more smoothly. I suspect some cost saving was implemented over the past couple of years as I noticed that the on/off switch did not have the same quality feel as my older lights either..

In summation, I recommend the AA size or the D size for best value and performance vs dollar spent. This light might have been a Monday or a Friday build which could explain the poor assembly quality.",2.0

"This brass covered kick plate arrived a day after it was supposed to.  It came packaged in a cardboard sleeve from Baldwin, the manufacturer, with a large window showing the product.

I immediately noticed a long scratch which appeared to be on the plate surface.  There was thin plastic sheeting covering the plate.  I peeled this back but the scratch in the sheeting went right through onto the plate.  Obviously someone had opened a larger box containing kick plates and cut right along the top one, unfortunately the one I received.  Also, no promised brass screws arrived with the plate.

"SUMMARY
It's ""ok"" and that's being kind of generous.

PROS
- Cheap
- easy to replace the guts of an identical unit
- quick access interior

CONS
- Noisy
- Doesn't move much air, even for small bathrooms.

DETAILS
If you are building new, or don't mind cutting the hole and framing for a fan, don't buy this. It is just barely better than no fan at all. It's noisy, and it really doesn't move enough air even for small bathrooms. There are much better choices available. They do cost considerably more money.

However, if you have this same fan already installed, and want a quick ""repair"" you can take the inner metal frame that the motor and blower wheel are attached to, and just slide that right into your existing housing. Fast 5 min repair. You can also buy the motor separately but I got one of those that had the shaft the wrong direction and was NOT reversible with the correct mounting for this design.

I think they actually redesigned this fan to make it louder because I had the identical motor and blower, yet this is twice as loud. It is because they wanted it to ""sound"" like it was moving a lot of air?? It doesn't move any more air than the old one that was quieter.

Update Feb 2105 (about 1.5 years after install) - this thing is starting to get louder, and making noises. The original that is in the other bathroom must be 40 years old and still works fine - this one sounds like it starting to fail after a year and a half. Rating reduced by 1 star from 3 to 2...",2.0
"I bought this fan to replace a really old bathroom fan. Removing the old fan meant breaking the drywall and patching it after this new one was installed.

I don't want to rip it out the wall to return it so now I have to shell out money for an ""upgrade"" kit to replace the entire motor and fan. What a big disappointment for me.

If this lack of quality is typical, be aware that youll quite likely have to soon repair this tool yourself,,,  or throw it in the garbage.

UPDATE:  Now 37 days after purchase, went to use the solder gun only to find it DEFECTIVE!  No (little) heat. Past Amazon's 30 day policy. Stuck with this DEFECTIVE P.O.S.  What a waste of money.",2.0
"I purchased this soldering gun for its power assuming it creates enough heat to do jobs on larger wires and connectors. I owned a 100W German Bosch when I was a teenager and that heated up in 3-6 sec and made connections on wires of 10 square mm2. This weller never heats up and annoys me to the extent that I will discard it if I will not get a response from Weller.

I did not get a response from Weller but found out that changing to a different tip improves the soldering capability, Adding one more star.",2.0
"The Jacobs Chuck turned out to be a chuck that could not be used on this drill.  I ended up going to Home Depot and found a chuck that would fit and is working fine.  It was not the chucks fault, it just was the wrong thread size for this drill.",2.0
Typical of these chinese made garbage solder guns. The two screws that hold in the tip can get stripped and they are almost impossible to find and replace. Funny how my buddy has an American made one from 25 years ago that still works to this day with no issues. Do not buy.,2.0
adequate but not high quality,2.0
"Ive had it out of the box twice, once to look at it and once to use it, today. It didn't seem to heat up at all, so I tightened the tip Allen head nuts, nothing, loosened and tightened again, heated up the, but seems sporadic. Lights do not work at all. Very disappointed, and too late to return,",2.0
Solders just fine.  But the lights do not work.  I didn't use it till after the 30 day return.,2.0
Item is not the color pictured. It is a SHINY brass not the ANTIQUE brass pictured. Makes a difference if you are trying to match your current lamp.,2.0
"I expected a soldering tool in good condition and ready to use.  Well, it looked just fine... However, the lights worked intermittently and it seemed to take a very long time to heat up.  After using it a couple of times, I checked it out.  The lighting unit was not properly in place and the super-cheap, shoddy lighting fixtures had come apart - the wiring loose from the back. That needed to be soldered (with a different soldering iron).  The reason it was so slow to heat up was that the tip had not been properly put in place. After loosening the tip unit and trying to get it in place, I had to bend it to re-shape it somewhat to get it in place and back into a proper configuration.  After fixing the soldering gun, it works great.  I find it hard to believe an old and well known name like Weller is putting out equipment that is so shoddily finished.  So, good soldering gun, but you may need to repair it before you can use it properly.",2.0
Both came with damaged edges. One sockey on each had screws missing and were loose so I had to rig it. Working for now but will return after a month or two to see how it holds up.,2.0
"The soldering gun works OK, except whose idea was it to design the controls so half a pull on the trigger is high power, and a full draw is low power?  Totally counter-intuitive.  But that's nothing compared to the flimsy case.  If your hinges last more than 5 openings of the case without tearing through, buy yourself a beer and a lottery ticket.  Total junk.",2.0
My husband used for the first time a couple of days ago and it does not work properly.,2.0
"my dad and I bough this soldering gun as we needed at least 200watts for our projects. you should have heard my dad's cussing and frustration... it felt more like 50watt gun. So, don't buy this misrepresented junk and shop for a better option. The only pro is that it was cheap more or less. you get what you pay for :)",2.0
My ordinary soldering iron is more powerful than this. Not delivering enough power - May the one I bought was faulty.,2.0
didn't fit,2.0
"I bought a Weller thinking this was still the premium brand in soldering guns. Right out of the box one of the #222 light bulbs did not work. The bulbs were threaded in so tightly that I had to disassemble the gun to unscrew the bulbs. Turns out the both bulbs were good but the socket assembly was poorly assembled and not making good contact. The insides of the soldering gun look very cheaply made and shoddily assembled. Anyway it works now and both bulbs light.

Most disappointing is that Weller couldn't be bothered to conduct a final quality check before shipping to confirm that the gun heats and the bulbs light. That QA check might take 5 seconds.",2.0
"Not sure if I have a different type of Kwikset lock or what, but this tool didn't fit.  I would suggest trying to take your lock apart before buying this tool.  The product description could be improved upon.",2.0
There is a small hole in the middle which is exposed. The hole was made to create a holding point for the Ground cable. It's very noticeable.... bad design. Could have made the hole little lower so it can be covered by the light socket or solder it on the back.,2.0
"If you have a Kwikset Laurel knob that's an oval shape this won't help you at all! There are no clips inside.

There is a tab you can depress on the outside handle when the door is unlocked. Then you can pull off the knob. All that's left is a retaining clip that holds the cylinder.",2.0
Not the size I expected. I guess it's my mistake,2.0
These hold cords well but don't stick to a wall worth a hoot!  I won't buy more.,2.0
Keeps falling off,2.0
I spent 2 hours following the directions and then improvising on my own - I could not get the fan balanced on high speeds.,2.0

"This is the OE replacement for my shop-vac. I attempted to use my air compressor to blow out the original filter and it pretty much fell apart when I tried. I wasn't using high pressure either. These are cheaply made, disposable filters. Oh well. Not much of a choice here.",2.0
didn't include needed parts,2.0
This is the second of these I've purchased and am disappointed with the lack of edge on them. My four year old nippers of the exact same brand are sharper than these brand new. I would recommend buying something a bit higher end or returning them if you're not happy with the sharpness. I had mine for too long before use to do this so I have only myself to blame for dull nippers.,2.0
"I purchased six of these for a cabinet I am building. Half of them were okay. The pull sticks because it was not spread far enough to ""flop"" down. I am going to try and spread them far enough to to protrude through the holes. Hopefully that will fix the problem but I'm not going to hold my breath. I have purchased them in the past but never had this problem.",2.0
"It was easy to install.  The dimming function does not work.  The switch has to be turned about 85% to bring on the light.  However, if left at that setting the light flickers.  It must be turn on all the way to eliminate the flickering.  Not what I expected!",2.0
"So it worked which was great.  BUT it only worked for just under 9 months.  This replaced the original switch that was in the lamp that was handed down from grandparents.  So I know they can last, this one just didn't.",2.0
It was broken when I got it and was returned.,2.0
Shop vac has really fell off. The vacuum power is just average and it always has something falling off of it. This is a wet/dry filter but as soon as you get it wet a few times u really have to change it. Will try another brand soon,2.0
"First switch was horrible- practically impossible to install because the rotating control arm portion of the switch (where the gold knob attaches) was simply too short once the assembly is mounted to a tubular surface such as the inside of your floor lamp. My floor lamp is greater in diameter than most. The replacement switch installed perfectly since the pole was longer. I have had the switch for three months and I keep thinking it will fail, but it is functional. I have to turn the knob all the way for the switch to turn on the lamp. Only then am I able to use the dimmer feature. My switch also has a humming noise at low light dimming levels.",2.0
"Cheap Chinese crap for sure....

The switch is beginning to fail after no more than a couple days.",2.0
"Even though I used 'filter for Shop Vac Brute model' in my Amazon search for a replacement filter, this is the filter that was recommended.  It is NOT for a Brute model, and is too large to adapt.",2.0
"I've taken countless trips back to the hardware store to try to get all the rest of the little fittings and parts that I need. I'm having a hard time building the lamp. If you are simply re-wiring an existing lamp, this would probably be great, but if you're creating one from the ground up, it's not as complete as it seems.",2.0
I was able to purchase exactly what I needed cheaper than this kit at a brick and mortar store.  Need better instructions as to how this kit can best be used.,2.0
"The kit does NOT include the lamp nipple.
The photo of the parts included looks as though it does, but the part in the photo which I thought was the lamp nipple (the threaded piece in the center of the photo) is NOT a nipple.

The back of the blister pack which had split open during shipping specifically says that the lamp nipple is NOT included
while the online description says that the kit includes, "" all hardware"".

Oh well, off to Home Depot to buy one.

The switch is pretty cheesey as well....the ends of the cord are tinned which is nice...too bad I didn't really need the cord.",2.0
"Fit the 500 watt lamp ok, but after only a couple of on off cycles it stopped working as a dimmer and acted as simply an on off switch",2.0
"I bought a nice-looking torchiere lamp at a garage sale.  It didn't work.  I replaced the bulb and tested the cord.  The only thing left was the dimmer.  The Angelo Brothers 70801 looks exactly like the original and received favorable reviews on Amazon, so I ordered one.  The package says it is a Westinghouse brand.  The line drawing on the package shows the unit mounted with the knob up and the heat sink down, which is opposite from the original installation.

The new unit comes with the knob installed.  Removing the knob from both new and old units was very difficult to pry off.  I crushed the new knob, but the old knob was only scratched.

I installed the dimmer knob-up first, then knob-down.  Neither worked.  I am giving the new unit the benefit of doubt because I may have damaged it trying to remove the knob.

Next, I ordered two Westek units; an extra in in case I damaged one.  The Westek ships with the knob NOT installed, has a more substantial housing, clear instructions, and four wire nuts.  It was obvious that the unit installs with the knob end down.  The Westek has a larger diameter, but fit my lamp perfectly.  The circuitry on the Westek is surrounded by hard plastic, instead of cardboard.

The Westek dimmer works fine.  It costs less than the Angelo Brothers Westinghouse dimmer.  Some reviewers stated that the Westek was too large to fit easily into the torchiere lamp tubes, but fit just fine into my lamp.",2.0
I looked up my shop-vac to see what filter I would fit. It came up with Shop-vac 90304 Cartridge Filter and it did not fit at all.,2.0
"Installation was easy enough, although getting the knob off without damaging it proved to be a chore. It worked as advertised, and the dimmer was functional. Anyway, less that two weeks after installation, I turned on and heard a pop. Now while the light works only at full power, the dimmer no longer does. So it's just a glorified switch.",2.0
"Shipment was prompt but module did not dim....just turned light off and on.  Company replaced defective dimmer, sending 2nd one promptly but this was also defective (would turn light off and on but would not dim).  I am pretty frustrated at this point since it takes 30 minutes to dissemble pole lamp and install new dimmer and reassemble. Reported 2nd defective dimmer to company and they promptly said they would credit the purchase. Company has been excellent to work with; I'm just sorry they got stuck with defective dimmers. I ended up purchasing (through Amazon) a Thomas and Betts Dimmer which I have just installed and works just fine.",2.0
Works if your carful and go slow,2.0
Very flimsy and cheap. A waste of money.,2.0
"Poor quality, shoddy workmanship, sums up this product.  The Westek is a far superior product if you are concerned about *quality*. Yes, the fit is tighter, but it does fit. And it comes with the wire nuts required for the job.

The Westek is encased inside a hard plastic shell and so can withstand some jostling during installation, but the Westinghouse unit is wrapped in flimsy paper with no support for the switch mechanism itself, which is important for the next note:

The ""press fit"" for the switch knob on the Westinghouse unit is not only too tight and impossible to slide off without marring it, the forces required also can (and did) damage the actual switch such that it didn't work properly. In fact, it seemed as if the knob was glued onto the pole.

So I just tried both units and the Westek wins - in my book - by a huge margin.",2.0
"Worked great, but didn't last long.",2.0
This tool demonstrated good stripping capability.  I've used it on my lawn chair and it's definitely a lot of work to do very little stripping.  I used it on my daughter's wood headboard and it gouged it so bad I had to fill it in and sand it down with a sander.  Definitely not for wood as advertised.,2.0

"This kit was not compatible with the lamp I purchased, although it was offered in a photo in the auction, as an extra... I basically could have purchased a .99 part and made the original wiring into a plug in... I had to splice the wires together and hope for the best. Make sure to check the electrical fixture out before wasting your money on this item!!!! Plus, the extra chain and wire sent were not the same color as the lamps, so I did not even use the chain and the in line switch that was sent had instructions that only an electrician would understand! Worthless... Better off going to the local hardware store.",2.0

"We have several oak cabinets in our bathrooms and an exact match was not expected.  However, the wood/finish is a darker red - much more so than the picture shown on the web and even the picture on the box it came in.  My wife thought the color of the item as shown on the web and on the box was fine (more to the gold color).  We ended up shipping the item back and shipping is not cheap, so it worked out that we only recouped a few dollars by sending it back.  Be very sure that the item will match your decor.  We did not install the item, but it seemed to be well built.  The oak itself is probably 1/2"" thick with a beveled edge and mounted to a narrow metal base that is beige in color.  The cups around the sockets are bright brass.  My wife wanted this design, but we couldn't find anything, so went with something much different and changed the hardware on the cabinets to match.",2.0
"I bought these with a new lamp harp I ordered and was very dissapointed in how cheap these feel and appear. I am guessing they are made of plastic and then painted, but I can't be certain. And the color was definately ""off"" from my lamp base. But it wasn't worth the cost of returning them. The shipping was not cheap and I was charged shipping for both the finial and harp which came together in the same packing envelope. The finial does not fit on the lamp with the replacement harp, so it just ""sits"" on top. If I had to do it over, I would definately select different finials or go to an actual store where I can see what I am purchasing.",2.0

"This square is now made in the USA, and, like our automobiles, is just not world class.

My ""square"" came considerably out of square and the blade had been dipped in some sort of protective coating which had dripped down along the edge of the blade so it was uneven.  After taking the coating off by 600 grit paper on plate glass I was able to square up the tool with some diamond needle files used in the slot of the body.

"When I first got this folding rule, I was quite satisfied. I checked it against some very accurate reference scales and it was right on the money. The folding mechanism was smooth. I thought I had a winner. It took a while for me to dislike it enough to order a different one. When I actually started using the rule on projects, it came up short.

Measurments that fall on or near the joints are difficult. The rule narrows slightly, due to way the hinges are designed. The center numbers are so big, they almost touch the scale. The combination of these factors makes it difficult to figure out the exact measurement. It took lots of measuring before this happened enough for me to realize that I was working slower and harder than necessary to maintain accuracy.

This rule lacks a sliding extension. When I made the purchase, I didn't realize this mattered, and for some types of work, it might not. However,  you can't make inside measurements, between two points, without it.

PROS:
Accurate scale
Low cost
Smooth folding  mechanism

CONS:
Scale difficult to read at or near the joints
Lack of sliding extension.

"How difficult would it be to have the two haves molded in such a way that when they fit together the holes line up with the screws?

"I have two of these in my apartment. They are both dated 2011. In the summer of 2015, one of them kept going off when I turned on my air conditioner. The silence button only worked for about a second before it went off again, even when I turned off the air conditioner. These things are not meant to be ""tampered"" with, so it took me a few minutes to pry the battery out of the unit to stop the alarm going at full blast and scaring my cat. Since the alarm would not stop with the batteries in, I did not put the smoke alarm back for several months.

A code inspection happened in my building several months later and I was forced to put it back or leave the building. I flinched as my landlord popped the battery in, but the alarm didn't sound. Everything was fine for at least six months, until it went off randomly at 4:30 this morning. Cat freaked out. No smoke in the building as far as I know. Nobody awake as far as I know. I pried the battery out again, and have been testing the unit throughout the day. No matter what, the alarm still sounds. I'm gonna give it a few days, and if it doesn't fix itself somehow I'm going to ask my building to replace it, hopefully with a different brand. I hesitate to say that ALL of these products are bad, though, because I've only had issues with one of them. The other hasn't given me any problems.

"I am giving this item 2 stars as the product itself is not bad for what it is however the company selling it is miss representing it.

"Anyone as old as myself, a baby boomer has probably used a Weller gun for electrical or plumbing work. I actually used this model's predecessor for maybe 20 yrs. without any issues. The gun used large nuts and copper tips that had to be bent at a right angle after slipping on the nut to be secured to the gun. You used the supplied open end wrench to tighten down the nuts. The tips lasted a long time. So, progress happens. The new design uses a THINNER gauge tip held on by an Allen set screw and removable collar. The tips invariably break at the same bend near the end after 10 uses. I try and keep mine clean and tinned. I keep the set screw snug. But, the tips break! Over and over and over. If you buy this gun, but a dozen spare tips. I think Cooper knows they have a problem. But, I don't think they are going to do a redesign. Sometimes older is better. Does anyone have the original gun or sale? Or where I can buy tips in bulk??? The storage case is a bit poor in design. Weller used to come in a nice solid integrated case. What's with the stupid clear plastic lid which falls out?",2.0
"I liked this faucet, and it appeared to be a good value. It worked very well for 2 years. It is still not leaking and the faucet is easy to control, but now the entire faucet mount has loosened up. The reason is the nozzle no longer swivels smoothly. So when you swivel it it turns the entire assembly. It either needs a new bearing washer, or something else. I ordered some parts to fix it. Hopefully that will work.
A replacement nozzle is over $60!
If new washers and o rings don't fix it I will take the advice of an old ex-plumber I worked with years ago, who only recommends Delta.
This Moen replaced a Kohler Pull Out faucet, that only started to leak after 8 years.",2.0
"Somehow I have one of these. In going thru the things Im holding on to, deciding what holds its worth well enough to continue carrying through my life, getting rid of this little flashlight was a no-brainer.

It had a battery in it when I went to test it. Tried the light, was very dim so put a fresh battery in. Still just as dim. Went online, read it was actually made to be only 2 lumens. Meaning the little light it is putting out is it's designed maximum. Useless. Well built, quality uselessness.

With all the led flashlights being made today (including the led version of this flashlight), there is no reason to continue using this outdated, impractical design.

Just re-iterating past reviewer's opinions.",2.0

"I live in San Diego county.  After two years, my Moen Chateau developed a pinhead size leak under the spout.  I took a picture, sent it to Moen, and they replaced it.  Good customer service.  Two years after that, the faucet developed another pinhead size leak in exactly the same place on the spout.  Conclusion, Moen kitchen faucets are manufactured too thin in the wall of the spout and quickly wear out.

"It's no fault of Amazon's or anyone else's, but I somehow thought I was ordering the LED version of the Solitaire and got the regular incandescent version instead. The two stars is purely for the flashlight itself. It's very very well made (I mean come on, it's a MagLite), but it is SO dim. Even the cheapest of LED flashlights is brighter than this. If you were trapped in a deep cave and couldn't get out any other way, having one of these would be better than nothing, but that's about the only ""good"" scenario I can think of. I've seen that there are LED conversions for these but it's an additional $8 and then there are fitment issues. I'm really not looking for that. I'll keep this thing in a drawer somewhere, and who knows? Maybe it will come in handy one day.

In the meantime, I'm going to go look for a better LED flashlight in this form factor.",2.0
"This is a cheap foreign job, nowhere near the quality that Intermatic used to be. My unit worked until just past the one-year warranty, and then promptly conked out.

"When I first revived the product I though it was the perfect solution to my problems with soldering RC car ESCs and battery terminals. Being in Afghanistan there are no local stores and I find myself a lot in the RC mechanic position for some of the carout here. The first ESC set went off without a hitch, the solder was able to quickly handle the 10 AWG and the ESCs motor and battery terminals.
The problem came when I started on a second ESC about 2 days alter. As I was soldering the battery connectors the gun just cut out no sparks pops or burning smell and the light was not blown out, it just didn't solder. Three screws hold the case together and when I opened it there was nothing that look obviously burned or broken. The AC wires run, one, to a trigger block that also powers the light on one side and the other runs to a small wire for the coil. On the trigger block the small wires for the coil are soldered to one side of the block with he AC wire running to the bottom and the other AC wire it is wrapped around a section of the coil wire with splice connector holding it all together. I re soldered all the connectors and soldered the splice connector with my smaller pencil solder, re assembled the gun and all was well. When it came time to start on the connectors for the battery i was tinning the plug when i heard a sharp pop and saw spark fly from the side case vents, the gun started smoking and I quickly stepped outside and set it down where it wouldn't burn anything if it did catch fire. When it stopped smoking a disassembled it to examine what had happened. The coil had fused together and the spark came from that as well as the tiny 1 coil wire connected directly to the AC line. It had blown off.
This gun is powerful and is able to heat up in a few seconds and quickly handle 10 AWG, RC connections being no problem. despite other reviews I actuality like the trigger mechanism which should allow you to easily stop the gu form overheating. It only needed between 5-10 sec per wire. I still don't know why it just quit. When it blew i wasn't doing anything different and the case didn't feel especially warm either.",2.0

"I bought this because my friend uses a Weller soldering gun at work, and he said it's a solid company in this market. But again he probably uses there something that costs $500 to $1K+.

As for this product I am not sure why there are so many positive reviews about this thing. The design is weak, the higher temperature/higher power level is not easy to hold as it's half way between the ""off"" and fully depressed (lower temperature) position ... so it's not obvios how you would hold on to this position with you finger, esp. when your attention is on the soldering/the wire, etc. They could have had some small side spring button that would help to fix it there and then just the entire thing could go off if you let the handle go (because it's only for the intermittent power consumption, which I inderstand).

Another bummer - the tips seem to be made from some ""peanut-butter"" - based material, the soldering tip is already broke in half and I was only on the second 24 AWG wire. The tips seem to get bend from the mere action of fixng them in place with those side nuts.

I am really thinking how I can return this thing after it broke in my hands during the first session (and I have been soldering since I was a teen)

One positive thing - the tips get to the target tempearure very fast indeed (although I was mostly successful with the lower tempreture setting - again see above about the inconvenience of the intermediate ""higher"" position).

But again in retrospect I should have gone to the local store and tried to get some sldering gun for electic/electronic works there.",2.0
"The bottom part is what I wrote thinking and looking at the photo Just knowing that I was getting what has been Weller's mainstay for 50 years.

LIE LIE LIE LIKE A RUG!  Which is another way to say a ""BEAR FACED LIE"" Or LAY as in getting hmmmmmm I can not say that word on hear as this is not TV. Nothing about this pistol style soldering gun reflects the older ones. Normally it is new and improved right? Not in this case. Speaking of CASE that is the only new part that is worth a dang, Blow molded cases are really nice, Too bad the handle piece of the gun isn't at least made of that grade of plastic. I would have settled for the old handle rather than the new style which is ba terrible grade of reused recycled caca. The posts that hold the copper tip they screwed up with as well. Come one set screws for a joint that has constant heat and cool cycle. The old style with the nuts over the tip metal worked just fine. If it ain't broke you do not have to go out and break it dummy. WHAT YOU CAN'T even get the product labels on straight. Hey there us a sot cast into the handle for them to fit inside the handle. I hope to find a way to take photos and show how bad this stuff is.

Tell you what Weller send me the old style Handle you can send the lables with the backing on them I can at least get them put on straight. Send me new posts that have the nuts that screw onto and hold the tip to them. also a new tip with the nuts to hold them on. The proper type of trigger switch that lets the light dim when you do the one stage two stage type. that has a focus lens in the bulb/ I have not wanted to take it apart to see how bad it is in side so let us leave it at that OK Weller Or at least send me the parts list for the old style guns so I can build one from scratch. If you do that I can find a few illegal aliens  to start assembling them I could sell them much fast than you can The word will get out in a heart beat,

""""""""""My Mom got me one of these so I could solder some little things I needed to solder together. Hey we lived out a ways and she got them with S&H Green Stamps. Yes I did learn to solder much better with other types later on still Every time I see one I think back to then. Back in the 70's I taught soldering classes at both Litton Ind and JPL in LA. One of my demo's was to show folks how to write their name with 22ga rosin multi core solder using one of these guns on low power and with a special home made tip I built out of solid copper wire.

To this day they still make these guns the same as they always have and I hope they always will. It is funny these guns cost $26 back then,,,, Let us say almost 50 years ago. and the still cost the same to this day. Course minimum wage was only 90 cents an hour back then. Hey I drove a tractor and got a dollar an hour plus room and board in the bunk house. After dinner we would get together some of us and walk the three miles to the general store use the pay phone their. A local call cost a dime.

A few days ago (October 2015), about a week after the Intermatic timer on our water heater died at the ripe young age of a year and a half, the wall switch timer failed too.  Not a ""hard failure"", but the knob cracked in half - in spite of not receiving any abuse whatsoever - I'm the only one who uses it, and I try to treat things with care.

It's a small failure, but renders the timer useless as the knob now can't develop enough torque to move the shaft on the timer.

"Technology is a marvelous thing. I remember when the Pentium 4 processors were the end-all be-all of personal computing power. I remember when six megapixels in a camera was a ""whooooooaaaa"" moment.

Things change, and this is especially true of electronics.

We've had LEDs for years, but until the past few years they had been destined to serve their place as tiny indicator lights. Well, that has changed. Big time.

LED technology is now advancing at a pace comparable to the PC boom of the early 2000s. LEDs are getting brighter, more efficient, and much cheaper to produce.

The history:

I have a 1977 Eveready ""Little Commander"" flashlight that runs on a single AA battery and puts out what I guess to be about .5 lumen. I bet you that was great back then. The Maglite Solitaire puts out a recorded 2.3 lumens, which can be focused or spread out.

The product:

The Maglite was the standard of excellence for years, both with law enforcement and in the home. They're tough, bright, and dependable. The same is true of the Solitaire (although on a much smaller scale).

My Solitaire is about seven years old, still on the original bulb (the exception, not the rule judging by the other reviews), is still water resistant, still has great connections, and is still solid as a rock.

It has, however, gotten a bad rap due to newer, brighter, and more efficient lights which have come out recently.

The competition:

Fenix- E01, L0D, LD01; 4Sevens- Preon I; etc.

These are lights that operate on a single AAA battery just like the Solitaire, but offer much higher lumen counts (10~90), much longer runtimes, and a much more robust light source (LED vs. incandescent).

My Fenix E01 throws 10 lumens for 10 hours, with an additional 10 hours on a low-power mode. The Solitaire throws 2.3 lumens for about... well, 2.3 hours.

Maglite as a company has rested on their laurels for too long and have become complacent in the ever-growing marketplace. They have a few LED adaptations of their classic lights, but it seems like they're considering this whole LED revolution a ""fad"" that people will grow out of.

""They'll get tired of the cool-hued, cold and sterile look of the LEDs...""

Not gonna happen.

This is not to say that incancesdents don't still have a place.

I still use my Solitaire to read at night so as to not disturb my wife.

It is a bit overpriced for what it is compared to others in the marketplace, but it is still a quality light that will be dependable.

--------UPDATE (6/4/11)--------

The original title of my review was ""4 stars 5 years ago, 3 stars today"". Well, I can say that it's dropped down a star. There are a plethora of single AAA that outshine the Solitaire in all areas, including output, runtime, versatility, and durability.

"The Mag-Lite Solitaire is well designed and well made but simply isn't bright enough.  However, if all you use a flashlight for is looking for your keys under the seat of your car or assisting with reading menus, it may be OK.  It has a sleek design, and it's appeareance won't draw attention on a keychain.  It functions like any other (large) mini mag light, by twisting the end where the light comes out to turn it on and off.  Change the battery by unscrewing the other end.  A spare bulb is concealed within the end cap.

Pros:

-It's small.

-it's well made, with all components fitting together smoothly, and a clean simple appearence.

Cons:

-it's just not that bright.  Some of the newer LED flashlights are of a similar size but much brighter.

Overall, I'd have to give this one a pass, unless I developed a fetish for small, well designed gadgets (like watches, watches are SOOO cool! and miniature sextents, those things are SOOO neat!).  OK, so I have this fetish, and this would explain why I have a Solitaire in my toolbox.",2.0

"Really this thing is just ok. I wanted a mechanical timer for our bathroom fan because I didn't want to spend the extra money for a digital timer just to have it break a year later.  While this timer does do the trick in regards to shutting off the fan after the set time, I have a few gripes:

1.) It's loud, obnoxiously loud in fact. With the bathroom door closed in our bedroom you can hear this thing ticking away loud and clear.
2.) For the price, it's really cheaply made.
3.) The knob was extremely difficult to get on the switch after it was installed. Also, when installed, the knob is about 1/4"" away from the switch plate leaving the fastener behind it exposed.

Two stars because it's currently functioning as expected.

The Hunter fans we bought are wonderful, but these remotes are awful!!!!

If you are truly desperate for a remote, these should do okay. If you mostly want to avoid dangling chains, then don't get this thing!!!

Instead, I recommend installing a separate fan control and a separate light control. That's what we did.

"I'm sure I'll get some ""not helpful"" clicks for complaining about an item breaking in 5 years but let me explain.  I realize 5-7 years is a while, but believe me, time flies by and you'll be digging into your electrical box to replace these.  I had 4 of these in 4 different bathrooms and every single one needed replacing in that 5-7 year window.  Not all were purchased at the same time either, so it isn't like  I received a bad lot.  The spring wears out and it won't turn off.  I'd find bath fan has been running for hours (or days) without my knowledge.  Now I'm also replacing a few worn out bathroom fan motors too.  Thanks Intermatic.  Not in the next house.

What is interesting is I had both this 60 minute version right next to a 15 minute version.  The 15 minute version runs an electric heater in the bath, the 60 minute is the exhaust fan.  The 15 minute versions all still work fine with its different spring mechanism so it spins faster.  It is only the 60 minute version that died on me.

Installation:
Somewhat a pain, since the fan cover in which the receiver needs to be 'tucked in' leaves very little wiggle room. This likely varies from fan to fan, but my Hunter provided a very tight squeeze. While the fan hangs from the hook on the ceiling, it takes 2 sets of hands to maneuver the fan/shroud/receiver to the point at which it 'tucks in'.
After getting the receiver installed into the fan cover, and securing the fan to the ceiling housing, it becomes clear that having to correct any wiring errors or make adjustments to the receiver will be a pain to say the least.
I became faced with this reality, when an hour or so after the installation of this remote, the fan light picked up a rogue R/F signal, and switched on. At first I thought it was the kids playing with the new remote. I turned off the light, but 1/2 hour later, it was on again. I hid the remote to make sure the kids weren't messing with me, and the light and fan came on by themselves. There is no doubt that this receiver is picking up signals from other R/F devices nearby. Since I haven't opened up the cover to reset the remote code (I dread doing this), we've been living with the light and/or fan coming on/going off randomly. It doesn't bother us immensely, but I can see how it would be very unwelcome in a bedroom or nursery.
My guess is that this receiver is very sensitive - too sensitive and picks up all kinds of R/F signals from the many, many signal-emitting devices that all households now have. Simply shortsighted design. I can't even begin to guess what's causing it. The choices are numerous.
In order to correct this issue, according to Hunter, you change the code on the receiver and remote. Easier said than done. I dread opening up that cover, pulling out the receiver and playing with various codes while it hangs.
In hindsight, this is what I suggest: Before tucking the receiver into the cover, with the fan switch off, test the pre-set code to see if the receiver picks up rogue signals by monitoring the fan light. If it comes on unprompted, change the codes and wait some more.
Somebody suggested trimming the receiver antenna down to a few inches if the remote is to be used within proximity of the fan. This makes sense, but I haven't tried it.
All in all, the unprompted behavior of this device puts it in the 'needs a design revision' category in my eyes, and therefore it only gets 2 stars from me.",2.0
"Like many others who have reviewed this product, I found issues with random changes of state for both the fan and light unit.  I have installed this with a Hunter 25578 The Studio Series 52-Inch Five Walnut/ Medium Oak-Blades-Ceiling Fan, Antique Brass.  My first codes, out-of-the-box and a first code change, resulted in the fan coming on when it wanted to.  The second change resulted in the light fixture coming on when it wanted to (generally at times when I was sound asleep).  The third change, now in effect for two weeks, has been quiet so far.  These changes wouldn't be so bad, but it is a royal pain to drop the canopy to change codes.  I cannot recommend this product, but I do not have a suitable replacement yet either.  It is a good idea. It is just done poorly.",2.0

The remote was easy to install; however it had many dead spots. The dimmer on the light was almost impossible to control. Last but not least- it stopped working entirely after 8 months. I definately would not buy this remote again. We have two other ceiling fans in the house with remotes(different brand) and they have been working fine.,2.0
"I have replaced the receiver twice because of lights blowing out. Each time a light goes the receiver stops functioning correctly. The first time the unit wouldn't operate at all so I spent $32 and 2 hours of my time replacing it. The second time the unit still controls the fan, but now the light is either on or half-way dim--won't go off and the gradual dim function doesn't work at all. Hunter's suggestion is a new unit. No way. I am looking for a better product.",2.0

"Gripe #1: Poor Product Reliability. My first unit had been installed by the previous homeowner. Within a year of our moving in, the fan/light stopped working. I assumed it was a random failure and bought an exact replacement #27185. Using the new remote, I confirmed that it was the old receiver that had died.

After installing the new receiver (not easy on a cathedral ceiling), everything worked as before. Thankfully, I did not need to toy with the DIP switches. As an added bonus, we now had an extra remote. Nevertheless, a few months later, the new receiver stopped working too. At this point I had two working remotes, two dead receivers, and zero interest in installing another #27185. I did complain to the company, and their solution (of course) was to offer me another receiver. No thanks.

Gripe #2: Inconvenient/Archaic Design. I also experienced 'unattended' turn-ons with the #27185. The light would *always* turn on following any power interruption; this behavior was so consistent that I assumed it was a design 'feature'. I rarely had problems with RF interference. However, the mechanism provided for solving such problems (flipping DIP switches on both the transmitter and *highly-inaccessible* receiver) is archaic and extremely inconvenient. Nowadays, even the cheapest consumer products (consider a typical cordless phone or baby monitor) have provisions for selecting alternate frequencies without resorting to DIP switches.

Alternative Product: I considered buying the similarly-priced Hampton Bay remote, but poor reviews convinced me that it would probably be no better than the Hunter. I have now settled on the more expensive Lutron Maestro. If it saves me the aggravation of ever replacing another canopy module, it will have been worth it. The Maestro is not susceptible to RF interference and has no DIP switches. The IR remote (strictly line-of-sight) communicates with a sensor integrated into the wallplate. The wallplate module communicates with the control unit through the existing wiring (probably similar to X10). As with the Hunter and Hampton Bay controls, the control unit needs to be wired into the canopy enclosure. This placement seems unavoidable in two-wire installations.",2.0
"Extinguisher lasted 18 months from receipt.  Seems to me that it should last longer, maybe several years.  Still...it worked out to a dollar a month for fire protection.",2.0
The timer works ok but the design of the control knob is bad .  The first time that I set the timer the knob split.  The timer has a d shaped metal shaft which fits in the plastic knob.  The part of the knob that fits over the shaft should have a metal band around the inner plastic cylinder of the knob. I phoned the company and they said that they would send me a new knob.,2.0

"As a countdown timer, it's functional, somewhat easy to install, and of decent build quality. But there are three things I don't like about it:
1) Once you set the timer, you can't force it backwards to turn it off instantly; if you change your mind, it will still be on for as long as you set it for initially. Other timers have this feature, and I think this is the biggest drawback and a reason to look elsewhere. Edit: Not true, I just had to be more forceful to turn it backwards.
2) In the final install step, you push hard on the knob to stick it on. It's a bit awkward and hard to push this on. But more importantly, I know if I ever need to remove it or change it out or take out the socket panel for any reason (paint? change the adjacent switch? needs to replaced?), it's going to be super tough to pull off the knob.
3) Hold feature didn't really work for me. I'm not sure how it can work since you can't forcefully reverse it out of the hold state. If you really want the Intermatic, get the cheaper version with no hold feature. Too bad at the time of looking for a timer switch, Amazon didn't have many other options..

So in summary, the timer is OK; I use it for a bathroom fan and it works, but there's much to be desired.",2.0
"I haven't had any problems after several years with this timer however a problem with my exhaust fan it's controlling has caused concern.  You cannot manually turn this switch off.

Fortunately the fan slowly started turning and did not burn up but I will be replacing the timer asap.",2.0
"It doesn't fit inside a decorator switch cover, despite the photo.  The face plate is slightly too large.

not what I expected.,2.0
"While it is true, that the switch works ok, it is poorly engineered. The electrical installation is very simple, as mentioned by others. Strip wires, insert in holes, and tighten screws. It is odd that first you have to put these in - they are packaged in an envelope instead of in the switch itself.

This switch has two major engineering flaws and a minor one. The panel with the time does NOT fit a Decora style plate. It is just barely too large to fit in the rectangular hole of a standard switch cover. Are you kidding me? This is probably why you won't find them in Lowes or Home Depot - too likely to get returned. Secondly, it seems that the threads for the screws from the switch plate are non-standard - and of course, whatever they are, the switch does NOT come with screws to match the threading.

Finally the knob itself is 100% plastic and the fit is severely tight making putting it on and taking it off a pain. It should probably have a standard little metal spring to manage this friction fit problem.

To install, you could either grind down the timer faceplate to the correct size, or you are forced to put the switch cover on before fastening the faceplate, since you will be installing the faceplate OUTSIDE the cover.",2.0
"Although the photo shows a faceplate, it does not come with one. The instructions note that if you order the ""silver"" color it comes with a faceplate, but not the white or ivory. So you still need to order a faceplate or make a trip to the hardware store.

There is also no place to hookup the ground wire, something most houses built in the last 50 years would require.

Instructions are virtually not existent as far as wiring. It's simple, unless you're trying to figure out where the third (ground) wire should go. But reading the poor instructions is a waste of time.

Once installed, it seems to work fine. It's a very stiff spring, so those with arthritic fingers may want to avoid this.
I tucked the ground wire under the metal tab. Hopefully, there won't be a short that tests out if this is the best place.

What should I expect, cheap product, cheap results.

If you review the Korky Quietfill Valve here on Amazon, you'll find numerous Fluidmaster 400A being tossed for them. Much better construction and overall dependable function. Also, if you don't have a water descaler like found at [...] then you will get scum build-up on the 400A in a couple years sufficient to require another replacement of the Fluidmaster.

After only 4yrs service I have two American Standard toilets that sing out at a high frequency (guessing about 8 to10Khz) tone - Yes it's very annoying.

My only real complaint about the instructions is the use of the shank washer. The washer comes with a piece in the center that prevents it from fitting over the threads of the shank as described in the instructions. I cut this part out with a utility knife, but mutilating a part makes me uncomfortable, as you might imagine. Also, it does not look like it is intended to be waste since it is shaped into a dome. However, there is no mention of any kind for what to do with this.

Eventually it all works fine, but I will probably choose a different brand in the future because of the amount of water it wastes.",2.0

The one I got leaked.,2.0
"This fill valve was purchased to replace a 15 year old Fluidmaster valve that was leaking between the upper & lower portion of the stem. This new one is still doing the same thing. only to a much lesser degree. When flushed, it shuts the water off cleanly at a level 1"" from the top of the overflow. But then the water level slowly creeps up until it is overflowing, ever so slowly.
  My other toilet has a Fluidmaster (age unknown), & it shuts off clean & the water level STAYS THERE.",2.0
"After only a few cycles of flushing, this fill valve malfunctioned and started turning on and off rapidly while shaking the plumbing pipes with such violence and loud banging it actually caused my pressure regulator to start leaking at the connection.  Also, it's a good thing I was at home when my son flushed the toilet because at first we thought it was the washing machine out of balance, but my wife said she wasn't doing laundry.  Then, my son said it started after he flushed the toilet.  Since I was not sure if that was the problem, I shut off the entire incoming water supply.  Fortunately, the main shutoff valve is located in the bathroom closet near the toilet and is quicker to access than the toilet shutoff valve.  I then proceeded to test it by turning off the toilet shutoff valve and turning the main water supply back on.  There was no more banging. When I turned the water supply back on to the toilet the banging started again.  No doubt that it was this new Fluidmaster 400A Fill Valve.  Good thing I have solid copper pipes or else I fear it might have easily snapped plastic pipes which would have caused a major water disaster.  I have never liked even the old Fluidmaster fill valves because they required constant repair of the rubber washer, but at least they worked.  All this new Anti-Siphon code regulation for toilet valves is probably the reason this unit failed.  SINCE THIS IS NOT THE REASON, I THOUGHT I WOULD POST A FOLLOW UP FOR THIS PRODUCT.  My research and talk with a plumber with over 40 years of experience said he likes the Fluidmaster valve and preferred them over other brands.  I found it harder to adjust the height and much easier to install the Korky, Model 528MP.  The Korky was very easy to install, but plumbers probably prefer the Fluidmaster because it is tamper proof after installation and maybe easier to repair. The Korky is also tamper proof if you place the provided plastic piece in the column after installation.  However, I have no reason to change the unit's level, but this is not the case with rental apartments.  In all fairness to the Fluidmaster valve it was not directly the cause of the pipes banging, because the Korky model did the same thing.  It turned out to be a worn out older type incoming water shutoff valve causing the pressure to flutter.  I temporarily fixed it by closing it all the way and then just opening it one and a half turns to restrict the flow, until I can install the newer type ""one quarter"" turn valve.  I may even buy the one that has a Water Hammer Arrestor installed directly on the valve, which you can view at Precision Plumbing Products, [...] Model MM500 ASTH 1/2"" FMIP.

"Bought a 6 pack of these when we painted the house. Within 18 months, we were having false alarms that always seemed to happen at 3:00 AM. A couple of the alarms are on vaulted ceilings and are a pain to get to. Bought individual ones to replace the bad ones and so far so good.  Religiously replacing the batteries every October. Also had the reset problem but figured it out. Bottom line, these are cheap smoke detectors and operate that way,",2.0
"From reading some of the other reviews of this product, I can see I'm not alone!  And of course whoever installed this alarm did not leave the manual, and I couldn't find it on line either!
  Of course the low battery chirping started early morning - and I tried till my fingers went numb to disconnect the A/C clip to get at the battery compartment - and couldn't get it out -so it chirped all day till I returned from work, and spent more time with it - finally had to dig out my pliers to grab ahold of the clip and was finally able to get it out and changed the battery - what a POOR design!
  So - keep your pliers handy for the next time you need to change the battery!",2.0
"We have 3 of these, one for each level, interconnected in our home.  I guess we should consider ourselves lucky since we've had no 3 AM false alarms in 11 years.  The chirping signals that the battery needs to be replaced.  To do so, pull the white plastic pin which allows the unit to rotate and hang from its AC wires.  Press both sides of the AC plug and disconnect the AC from the unit.  Open the battery door and insert a new 9V battery.  Reassemble the unit by reversing the above steps.  The unit will then aggravate you by chirping for 5 to 15 minutes until it clears itself and then you'll hear silence until the next battery replacement.  My wife has tested our main floor unit a few times by burning something in the kitchen.  They do work quite well when there is actual smoke.  I haven't cleaned any of my 3 units in 11 years but after reading the reviews, I think I'll hit them with some compressed air.  I came to this site because I need to replace one of the 3 as it's siren has failed.  Best of luck to everyone, and let me know if you find anything on the market which is of better design.",2.0
This stupid thing went off this morning and I couldn't get it to turn off...I waved a towel in front of it several times...turned on the AC. It finally turned off when it hit the concrete floor of my kitchen at about 85 mph. good news is that Kidde will take care of the unit for you...no return of original unit is required.,2.0
"Good service from this vendor, but I later discovered this exact product at a big chain home improvement center for about half the price.  The smoke alarm works well (sometimes too well), but the design of the plug is weak.  It is difficult to plug into (and unplug from) the ceiling.  The plastic plug can easily break in the struggle.  I chose this model only because it replaces a damaged one that came with the house.  If possible, try another brand or model, and do a little price comparison with the local home improvement center.",2.0
"this product is the obsolute worst and it took me six years to discover this. we bought our house brand new and it was already equipped with this smoke alarm system. when the chirping started about several months ago we didn't have a clue (and still don't) on how to stop it. there was no manual or instruction left. its electric and I don't know how to get to the battery. i can't believe they put these smoke alarms in new houses without a manual. after viewing all the negative reviews and seeing that the product is discontinued, we will probably have to replace all of smoke alarms in our house. there's one in every room. how can a company provide a product with no instrutions to service it.",2.0
Bottle arrived borderline empty/full.,2.0
"same as everyone else, I'm afraid.  These things stink!  I think the designer spends too much time sitting around in plaid pajamas with his thumb in inappropriate places.  These things go off periodically for absolutely no reason.  The wiring harness is too hard to take off the blasted thing, and shut it up.  I really don't have a yearning to wake up in the night to its shrieks and shrill cries.",2.0
Moved into our home a year ago and it had the Kidde 1275 alarms - no manuals left for us.  Have had no problem with it chirping (even in the kitchen) but when I went to change the battery learned I would have to disconnect the AC wiring tab to access the battery compartment.  The AC wiring has locking tabs that prying with a screewdriver will not release - and no instructions on how to disconnect are on the unit.  The manufacturer should provide online documentation considering this a is a safety device.  I am concerned that I will break the tab/wiring harness and have to wire in a new unit.  I am handy enough to replace it but if people are to service these regularly there should be better support. Given todays internet capabilities I no longer think there is a reason for a manufacturer not to have online documentation.  2 stars for poor support.,2.0
"From my personal experience and the other reviews here, it would seem this alarm might be more likely to have false alarms; in the manual they're called ""Nuisance Alarms""  ([...] is an Acrobat/PDF file).

Like others commenting here, I suspected some sort of defect (okay, so I was muttering that they were crap alarms, but it *was* 3 a.m.) or that they had some sort of magical internal clock to allow them to go off in the middle of the night.

It seems clear that (at least for me) the problem isn't a low battery ""chirp"", since I am very conscientious about changing the batteries (every 6 months; I even use my Dymo LetraTag to label them with the date), the ""alarm condition"" indicator is on, and all the units are bleeping thanks to the interconnect.

We had four years of trouble-free protection, but have had Nuisance Alarms at least once per year for the past three years.  This time around, when I took down the last alarm, I found an ant crawling on it.  It makes sense that early morning Nuisance Alarms would be insect-triggered.  On the other hand, it was a single ant- there is no nest, and this is hardly an infestation.

On the plus side:

The alarms can be interconnected.  This can be a liability, too, especially in the case of Nuisance Alarms.  It does demonstrably wake you up inside a closed bedroom if there's a problem elsewhere in the house.

The alarms are powered by AC, with the battery as a backup.  Sort of ""belt and suspenders"" plan, but the more failsafes in a safety product, the better.  It also seems a little louder than strictly battery units, although this might be due to the interconnected alarms going off together.

On the minus side:

Nuisance alarms appear to be more common than average.  It is unclear whether this is due to a specific flaw, the type of detector, or some other factor.  I believe it might be insects (particularly scout ants) finding the units as a result of the wiring, which could be another reason to avoid the AC power/interconnect feature.

The way they have configured the indicator lights is confusing.  A flashing red light indicates normal operation; the flashing green light is used to show you which unit triggered the alarm.  This is the reason that the problem alarm was the last one I took down- the other four had flashing red lights so I checked them first.

The AC connection is difficult to unclip.  I would have preferred a connector integrated into the mounting base, as you see on digital thermostats.  Instead, the wiring comes through the base, and ends in a connector that attaches to the back of the unit with two clips.  This connector also covers the battery door, so you have to unclip the wire each time you change the battery.",2.0
"Really not impressed. I bought several of these at once (3x). They have all exhibited the same behavior. #1. - Timer gets messed up and will not come on, or it sends just enough juice through the circuit to see a extremely low voltage device flicker. This can only be fixed by 1. Switching to OFF. 2. Unplugging the unit. 3. Wait 2x minutes. Re-insert into electrical receptacle and reselect the timing option you want. Several said here, moisture is getting into the unit.  Not sure on that. I bought ""Woods"" over the other brand, as Woods in the past has been a quality product for me. Not so with this item. I have it set on Dusk to Dawn for a low power LED for landscaping. Just about once or so a month, it screws up and will not come on... initiating the hard reset by myself. There is very limited choices out there, for this type of a device, I am quite disappointed in Woods. Unit might also be sensitive to power spikes on low-power conditions.",2.0
"Now let me preface this by saying: I've never been taught or used a fire extinguisher before, yea I know, I know...Anyway, I bought 2 of these for the house, I read the instructions and even watched a video just to make sure I was doing it right. So just to make sure, I decided to sacrifice on of these, and when I did, it shot one quick burst and that's it, after that it woulnt shoot anymore, even though the gauge is still in green. I left the other one in the kitchen, but I'm nervous...Hopefully we won't ever need it because I'm worried it'll fail in an emergency like my test one did.",2.0
"Arrived in a partially opened box that was too small. Included a copy of my sale sheet as well as a sale sheet for another customer.

"I thought bigger would be better when I ordered the FatMax.  You would think a blade almost 1 1/4"" wide would be quite stiff.  However I found when the blade is in a vertical position, as for example measuring a line on a wall, the blade will collapse past 24"" of extension.  I find this incredibly annoying. I have an older tape measure with a blade only 7/8"" wide and it can be extended almost 4' before it collapses. The length of the case is not indicated on the FatMax. This is helpful to know when measuring between two walls.",2.0

"I live in an apartment and needed a paint stripper that was non toxic since I have to do my handy work in the livingroom.  I needed to strip the paint from a 60"" wide windowsill, and two flat panels of my radiator cover (30"" x 25"").  I did everything according to directions, covered the applied stripper with plastic and waited overnight.  The stripper took off one layer of latex paint.  So I applied a second coat and wrapped the panels in plastic and waited 18 hours.  The stripper took off another layer of latex paint, but the 3 layers of oil-based paint underneath was intact.  I had to repeat this process 4 more times and used 3 quarts of the stripper before the paint was completely removed.  This was quite costly, made a tremendous mess that I had to live with for almost a week, and during the process I regretted having started the project.

If you are taking off one layer of latex paint this stripper is fine.  For anything else, I think another poduct is needed.",2.0

I don't normally do reviews cause they are mostly opinions. However I've been a contractor for 25 yrs and have only used Stanley tapes.

"I agree with some of the other posts as far as quality with This newer version of fat max. I am a concrete carpenter and I've been using the 35' fat max since it came out. just until recently I purchased a replacement And noticed the tape itself had turned into a flimsy, less curved, tape that bends more often when extending the tape, especially when you try to hook your tape vertically as with columns or walls. That and the fact that the tape extends 11' before breaking was the reason I went with Fatmax. The exterior of the tape remains the same 5* quality but the tape itself has turned into your basic tape. Hopefully the company notices and returns back to the original version, no improvement has been made with this version NONE.
On these pictures you can see the curve difference on the tape has changed making it flimsy when I extend the tape at a slight angle it breaks within a foot or so as apose to the original version which extends a lot further before breaking.",2.0

This has a weak recoil & fairly weak break-over point. I use a tape every day & fought this one all day the first day out & at 4:00 pm it went sailing in a pond.

"I've had mine for seven years, originally purchased at a brick-and-mortar store that rhymes with ""Lome Keep-Oh"". When I read this is likely the best tape measure, my hopes for a frustration-free measuring experience died.

On with it!

The lock is too loose and has been since day one. Sometimes it will stay put, most times it won't. The curses that've left my mouth because of the craptastic locking mechanism would make sailors blush.

 Additionally, the tape starts to resemble one of those car dealer inflatables with the waving arms after 6'. It drives me BONKERS! trying to measure anything across the room because the stupid thing won't stay put.  And because of that, the tape has started to warp a bit so now it won't even lay flat.

 The case is fantastic. It can take a beating and will barely get a ding.

As for the spring and recoil, it's crazy smooth even with the warped tape going through.

 In summary: I wish I had as big a love affair with the FATMAX as everyone else but I have been hate using it since the day I purchased it.

Very heavy.  Measurements are only on one side.  There could have been numbers that read vertically on the other side. Calling out 1/2 or 7/8 would have been nice. Stanley went cheap on this one. It's rugged and grippy. That's about it's only redeeming quality.,2.0

"Well technically this isn't the same Fat Max tape that Stanley used to make a few years ago. I used to be able to get 3 months out of the older versions. With these ones I can get about 3 weeks to 2 months of use out of them. It depends on if I'm working inside, the time of the year, etc. Out here in Seattle the jobsites are usually sandy and wet. In those conditions I can get about a month out of this dummied down version. Look, I know they want to save money or raise the price of the tape but Stanley should have thought this through a little better.

10 years ago I could get about 3 months out of these tapes. Back then, I had to throw them out because the rust would wear off the paint on the blade. These days the blade usually tears somewhere before the 2' mark. I do have a little more trouble with the blade getting dirty and not retracting all the way.

Would be an awesome tape if the spring was strong enough to pull it back in.  I have owned both 35' and the 40' with both having the same issue with the spring.  I would recommend the 25' it will stand out the 11' and will recoil without having to be physically pushed back in.,2.0

Unless mine is super sticky, it's not easy to operate like on my old standard Powerlock. Also, the whole body is fatter than standard, which might be good if you have gigantic hands, but it doesn't fit in my pouch tape pocket without a lot of pushing and tugging.

"I'm a professional contractor who has been using Stanley tapes for over 20 years. The stiffness of the thumb-button renders this tool virtually useless (shouldn't need 2 hands to lock it). BAD design. This has been pointed out in some of the other reviews. And the stand-out length isn't dependable every time. In a very short time it weakened and the steel cracked at the 10 ft. mark. I was going to buy another (thinking it might be a one-time thing), but every one I picked up in the display had the same stiff-button issue! I bought the equivalent Dewalt tape instead, and I'm happy with it so far. Stay away from the Stanley!",2.0
"Nice tape, but cannot be removed from packaging.  I cut the plastic and cardboard where indicated, cut off all excess around ruler, cut the two tabs where indicated, tore all the plastic, cut my finger and gave up?  It's not worth it.

"Thankfully, I have never had to use this fire extinguisher - or any other one - in my home. After doing a decent amount of reading, I purchased this fire extinguisher for a specific area of the house. It was chosen for its ABC rating and also its relatively small size.

Approximately two or so months after receiving the item from Amazon, I received an email - also from Amazon - notifying me that there had been a recall for this brand and model. I want to point out that while other people may have thought about recalls, that was something I had never really considered, so I was extremely happy to see that Amazon had been watching for recalls on products that I had purchased. Very cool.

The recall email from Amazon directed me to Kidde's website, where I had to fill out a form in order to have a new unit mailed to me. It took NINE WEEKS for Kidde to finally get the new extinguisher to me. Very not cool.",2.0
"Must be just mine as I haven't see another review that mentions this.  The thumb locking button is a real pain to push to get the tape measure to lock in place.  I have a tough time doing it with 1 thumb.

I never thought of this before, maybe my expectation for this well known tape measure had my hopes up, but I'd love it if this tape measure didn't buckle when holding it sideways.  You can only read the tape if you are holding it below head level.  Sometimes you have to take a reading overhead and need to hold the tape sideways so you can read it.  Does anyone make a tape measure that is sturdy somewhat when it's being used sideways?",2.0
"while it works on my DeWalt portable vac, the fit is not quite perfect. I don't recommend it. Given it's plastic and has some flexibility, one would expect the fit to be better. Poor design",2.0
"I bought one of these a couple of years ago and the blade recently developed a split and has now become a $20 paperweight, since Stanley does not sell replacement blades. I think the whole FatMax line of tools is just a lot of advertising hype. Its creation was solely for marketing purposes, and had nothing to do  with improving existing tools.",2.0
THERES A RECALL ON THESE.,2.0
"I presume this will work on a fire, but it arrived with the 'fill dial' right on the line between 'full' and 'empty'. I presume it has enough pressure to work, but that doesn't seem great.",2.0
"I bought 3 of these units. They were fully charged and properly boxed. Fire extinguishers are one of those items you should always have but never want to use. Fortunately for me, I have not had a need to use one.

However, I received two notifications from Amazon saying the extinguishers may be defective. The first notice came about a month after purchase. I checked the model number involved in the recall and these were not on it. Then I received a second notice from Amazon and about a week later a box arrived in the mail with 3 new extinguishers in it. Also included was a really nasty little threatening note from Kidde saying that the old ones can't be used...you can't resell them...if you use them you are in trouble...blah, blah, blah. However what was not included in the note was an explanation. They could have easily been more civil and clear especially when they are the ones putting out a defective product. Also, it is not like you can throw a fire extinguisher in the garbage and because it is defective my local fire department won't take it. I have to wait for hazardous material day at my local recycling center to get rid of the defective units.

So, I have not used the extinguishers and hope I never have to. But before you buy this unit, make sure it is not on a recall list",2.0
"I like everything about this tape except for the poorly designed lock. The lock works fine if you're just setting the tape on a flat board, but if you need to hang it over the edge of your work piece, the lock automatically releases and the tape falls to the floor. That's a big pain especially when you're on a wall.",2.0
"The FatMax has a durable look and feel, but make no mistake, obsolescence is built-in.  After a year and a half of occasional use, the spring broke and is not replaceable.",2.0
Doesn't fit the portable DeWalt vacuum.,2.0
"I own a couple Stanley measures and now that I've had this one for a couple months I can say with some confidence that even though the extra width of the tape allows you to extend the tape further than a narrower tape, the other drawbacks exceed this benefit.

So, the cons:
1) the end of the tape is not firmly riveted to the tape, so you won't get accuracy to the 1/16, probably not to the 1/8th hooking or pushing the end to anything. You  would have to start at 1"" and go back from there.
2) The body is plastic. I don't drop stuff unintentionally often. But sometimes my hands are full and I need to drop something a foot or two. With the metal case stanleys, it's never a problem. This tape, as other reviewers have said, is not strong enough to take much typical construction wear and tear. The case, after a couple months, is already a little loose, and that's just from frequent home use.

So, all in all, not a real good buy for the frequent tape user, sorry to say.",2.0
"As a cut man my tape measure is perhaps my most important tool. It enables me to accurately make measurements to be cut. I purchased this tape due to my previous good experience with stanley products and the stand out feature sounded nice. My previous tape that I actually started my job with was a 30' stanley maxsteel, so a lot of my opinions are based in direct comparison to that.

On the good side, the fatmax tape does have an excellent standout, which is really nice when you are working alone or don't have someone near by to hold the other end and you are trying to hook a good distance away. I cant give you an exact measurement of the standout and really I wouldn't be disappointed if it was a little less then advertised as it is substantially more then the maxsteel tape. The tape case has been very durable, its survived falls off roofs, scaffolding, etc with no problems. Another feature I really like is the rubber bottom. I can place the tape extended on a board and the rubber will grip the board enough that I can take my hand off the tape to make multiple marks where the tape would be out of reach. Of course I could use the lock feature but as mentioned the lock is noticeably hard to engage, so just running the tape down and letting it sit upright has been nice.

Now the bad ""features"", as mentioned the lock is difficult to engage, but more importantly to the tape itself, there are several things I don't like. To get such a long standout the tape is wider and is curved more on each side, this creates some problems for me. One is to actually get an accurate measurement I need to twist the tape a good deal, especially on shorter measurements, for the edge of the tape to sit down on the board. This sometimes causes the hook at the end to jump off the board. Also when bowing the tape into a corner to get a measurement, some creative twisting is needed to again try to get an edge to sit flat to get a measurement. While with all tapes you will have to do this to some degree, with the fatmax it is to a level that is annoying and in a lot of cases takes more time to get a measurement then would be required with a thinner tape.

In conclusion the fatmax tape does have its advantages, its long standout can prove useful in some situations (working alone, reaching the end to a helper across an abyss). The hook is nice as it can hook on both the top and bottom sides. The extra curve will be annoying at best though. Id recommend this for framing but for finishing you are better off with a powerlock or similar standard width tape that isn't curved as much.

Originally rated **, would now rate *** after going back to a powerlock and missing some of the fatmax features when framing.",2.0

"I'm with the other 2 star  guy . I use mine many times a day . I wear them out fast. If you bend it to read the tape, its nick city, then tape tear, then new tape. I'll be getting the cheaper one myself. UPDATE
Whatever problems they had they are fixed  I tried all the other tapes (I got a pile)they are not worth the effort. At any rate I kept using my last tape and am still using it, changed the case (old broken tape) because the lock quit working, but still the same blade all this time, and I measure a lot.",2.0
"I'm a finish carpenter and unfortunetely I got addicted to the fat max too, but after going through one tape every 2 months or less I've switched back to the ""Wimpier"" 1"" rule. The problem is that the tape is so ridgid (which is great if your measuring across a room) that it gets nicks in the side of it instead of flexing then when the edge of the tape hits anything the tape starts to rip and after a few more uses the tape breaks. After dropping $25 bucks a tape every couple of months i just can't afford these tapes anymore. They are nice but you have to baby them, even so I still go through them way too fast. I use my tape hundreds of times a day and this one just doesn't stand up to the punishment. The locking mechanisim doesn't work well either, you have to push much harder than most tapes to lock the tape in place.",2.0

Now I'm supposed to go through a return process and waste more of my time for 8 bucks?  I'd prefer if they just made a better product and charged a little more.",2.0
"I've been stymied trying to find the width of the Fat Max's body to calculate the total length. I measured it with another tape (irony) at 3 1/4"" but wondered why there wasn't an indication on the housing. Finally, with my arm's-length near eyesight I found a molded legend that's almost covered by the belt clip. Pisspoor product design, but it's a Stanley tradition. Even with reading glasses its hard to read the reflective chrome plated numerals on earlier Stanley tapes I've owned. I wrote a big ""+3 1/4"" on the case with a Sharpie and vow to avoid Stanley products in the future.",2.0
"I bought this tape awhile back, I have been a Stanley tape using for years, I find that the hook on the end does not grip properly, I think that it is because the wide blade has a deeper arch in it and the hook needs to be a little longer. It pops off alot which is a real hassle. Although I have this one in my tool box, I pretty much use my 3/4"" blade Stanley most of the time.",2.0
"I really liked the Fat Max 30' tape. However, Stanley does not make replacement blades for it.  My Fat Max is a little less than a year old and has developed a hole at about the 11 foot point.  Because no replacement blades are available, the cost for  replacing it with a new one is too high.  Too bad Stanley doesn't stand behind the fat max with replacement blades like they do with some of their other less sturdy tapes.",2.0

"I got this to regulate the times my pool pump operates. For the most part, it works. However, I'm not entirely sure how well this thing works outdoors. Anytime we have a good rain, it locks up and stays in the position (on or off) it's in at the time. Because it locks up, I have to unplug it, take it in and wait for it to reset itself. Then, I can operate the buttons and change the time again. The last time, the LCD display went berserk and didn't reset for days (turns out the reset button worked in this instance and got it back to the 12:00 display). It seems to work a while during good weather. I won't need it in the winter, so I won't know how it'll hold up there. But, the locking up is an annoyance. The fact that it's supposed to work outdoors and thereby implying it can handle weather irritates me more. At least it doesn't completely fry in the rain. I'm sure it'll work fine indoors if you want it to turn your lights on and off, but I'd pass on it if you want it for outdoor use.",2.0

I didn't open it right away and sat it on the kitchen table to deal with later. When I opened it I noticed how dusty everything was. Somehow the pin had come loose. Not sure if in packaging or shipping, but the extinguisher discharged inside of the box. I had to clean the thing and get rid of the box (and change my clothes!) because the stuff was EVERYWHERE!

Some engineer at Woods got way too carried away.  Who will EVER use 20 individual, programmable timers?? Take the time to understand how your customers - or at least 99.5% of your customers - will use this thing and put the engineering time into making it simple to use!!!!

This thing does NOT need to be that complex.  C'mon engineers...quit designing things with so many arcane features and just design something that is so simple to use that a 4 year old can use it.  Didn't we learn anything from programming VCR's for crying out loud???  Hello???",2.0
"one of them just quit working after 3 months. The light that you plug into this will not stay connected on the inside - if you jiggle the plug, it will connect briefly, but it will not stay on.  Cheap",2.0
Worked great for the first year and I went to use it for my above ground pool for year two and the buttons do not work. Unit turns on and I also hit the reset button. Anyone also have these problems? And if so can it be resolved?,2.0
"I purchased this Woods 50013 Outdoor 24-Hour Digital Outlet and used it for two nights. I thought it was easy to program, had it set too long one night and just changed it yesterday to adjust the hours. But, last night we had rain roll through here and the lights came back on and stayed on all night. I checked this morning to see why the lights were back on. It was waterlogged. I dried it out and now the power will come on but you can't program it. I know they are made for the outdoors so I don't see how it could get waterlogged.",2.0
"I bought 2 of these 2 months ago.  One of them is broken already, it makes a horrible noise :-(",2.0
"Now it serves as a 10 inch extension cord. (How's that for making lemonade out of lemons!)
It (sort-of) worked long enough that I never returned it. Now it just sits outside.",2.0
"This product on lasted 3 months and then would not work for our outside pump. Replaced with another brand from Home Depot and it is still working in the rain, cold.",2.0
It worked fine for a while but after a month or so it just stopped.  Just past the return date...,2.0
Does not operate simply.,2.0
I returned it,2.0
"Has little, delicate buttons you need to push down between the times you want it to come on and turn off.  I think  the little buttons are pretty fragile, as they held for a couple of days, and then it just began to stay on all night.  Only used it for a week so far, and will reset today to see if it can be re-set and/or still works at all.",2.0
Hard to set the time on this and it didn't seem to work consistently,2.0
"I use this timer to control the misting system on a reptile habitat.  I liked it because I could run the water several times a day at 1 to 5 min at a time instead of having to turn it on for 15 min at a time like some if the other timers I saw.

Problem is it will reset itself.  I will go check the timer and 12:00 will be displayed on the screen.  You then have to push the tiny reset button and re program the whole thing.  If you don't check the timer everyday then it could fail to go off and then I am left wondering how long my animals have gone without water?!

When it works , it works great ..but unreliable if you are depending on this timer to work every time",2.0
"This turns on at dusk, so that's great.  However, it switches on and off.  On for about 5 seconds, then off for about 5 seconds.  I don't want my Christmas lights going on and off, and I don't see anything about this in the description, package or paperwork.",2.0
This didn't work. Sent it back !,2.0
"LCD display became defective after less than two months. And I cannot return it after more than 30 days. I like the design, but worthless when you can't even read the LCD display.",2.0
2 - Photocell timers were purchased and received in a timely fashion.  After a week or so of operation ??? One (1) of the timers a STOPPED working and apparently has NO warranty and NOT able to return for replacement ??? Not acceptable at all.,2.0
"I have had this timer for a little over 4 months and it has stopped working.  Timer was securely mounted to a wall and when it stopped working I removed it from the wall, unplugged it and discovered the internal battery is not working and something is rattling inside.  Not sure how something mounted to a wall, plugged into a GFCI outlet, in a protected area disintegrates internally.

The timer isn't the easiest to program, but while it was working, it did it's job.",2.0
Stopped working.  On the power work now on and off back to wear I started....,2.0
"Unit failed after a year and a half. The reset button resets the timer, but the keypad keys no longer function.",2.0
I used this to control 120 volts to a 24 volt transformer for a small garden sprinkler. It tripped out several times during the year. After 13 months it tripped out and could never be reset. Had to trash it.,2.0
Bought two and one failed to work after two weeks,2.0
Stopped working after four months due to water intrusion from normal rain.,2.0
"Had one exposed to a weekend of heavy rain while I was away.  It definitely was not in any standing water or anything, but when I returned, it had started to short out and run intermittently (highly suspicious to the neighbors).  Ordering another to replace it and I am going to shelter it a bit more this time.",2.0
Stopped working after one month.,2.0
Worked for about 5 weeks then couldn't set the time which it keep running slow then it just stoped,2.0
"well it works.... it turns stuff on and off, the pins work. however the timer work slower than regular clocks and constantly loses time; so it doesn't do its job of turning on/off at specified time and intervals (intervals always longer due to slowing timer). also a lesser problem pins represent approximate on /off times, the timer will turn on/off at the approximate time indicated on the dial. in order to get the timer to turn on/off at approximate time intervals that match my needs i have to reset the timer every morning.",2.0
"The timer keeps flashing ""C"" even though it has not been unplugged. You have to keep reprogramming it every so often.",2.0
Description of item is not clear enough to know that you cannot set time to your own standards.,2.0
"This thing is NOT dew, moisture, or rain proof.

If you need to time an outdoor circuit you need to find a different solution than this.",2.0
"Bought to control outdoor holiday lights for dawn-to-dusk usage. Was plugged into GFCI-controlled outlet (as specified in manual) on front porch under the porch roof, but during windy rainy days, it would get some rain spray and trip the GFCI circuit. Removed the Woods 2001, no triggering of GFCI. Add Woods 2001 back and GFCI triggered. I took Woods unit inside when GFCI just triggered, and disassembled. Did not see water within the Woods unit on circuit board, but obviously had issues with the rain spray or humidity. So it's not very weather resistant. Or I just had a defective single unit, but thought I should report it here.",2.0
"the light sensor is not very reactive to ambient light. I use it for Christmas light in my foyer. Although it is day and has enough ambient light, it thinks it is dusk.",2.0
It stop working when its rain.,2.0
"This timer worked perfectly for the first season I used it (last year). This year, it worked perfectly for a week then died last night during a heavy rainfall.  A substantial amount of water collected inside the unit and the LCD screen and all timer/clock timer functions failed.  It still passes power to the outlets, leaving me with a $20 outlet duplex adapter...",2.0
This initially worked for several weeks but now is simply a glorified on/off switch.  The light sensor does not work so it no longer senses when it becomes dark to turn on.  I just went on line to return  this and see that I am now a day beyond the 30 day return period.  I have used this type of sensor previously and for several years without problem so I might look for another brand and test my luck.  Fingers crossed....,2.0
"ONLY LASTED A COUPLE MONTHS, HAD TO BUY A NEW ONE LOCALLY.",2.0
He told me he said it ok but some it not work but it work on and off.,2.0
I have had this timer for 1 month and two days. It was great while it lasted. It just died and of course it is not eligible for return at this point. Annoyed...,2.0
Don't last too much,2.0
"Too time consuming to program, company could do better.",2.0
I should have returned this item because the timer does not work.  The lights stay on way past the setting.  I installed it and then went out of town for 2 months so did not contact the seller.  Most Woods products are very good quality so I was surprised.,2.0
"arrived on time and as advertised, pain in the ass to use.",2.0
"I returned this item after trying to re-program it several times. I think it had a problem with A.M. and P.M. but it either caused what was plugged into it to stay on or not come on after it went off.  Of course, mine just could have been defective. I did appreciate Amazon's return policy.",2.0
"This was plugged into an outdoor power outlet. The outlet also had a bug-zapper with an outdoor remote control. Anytime I turned the bug-zapper on or off, this unit would reset. I'd read other reviews about similar issues and saw a response from the manufacturer with possible solutions. A power strip isn't an option for me and I don't have time to fool with it so this went back. I ordered an analog timer that is doing the job fine. Two stars for the manufacturer trying to offer solutions.",2.0
"I've purchased three of these units in the past year. The first two worked well for a few months before the problems started. I set them up to run a sump-pump to water my garden three times a day from a greywater collection tank fed by my showers and hand sinks in the bathrooms here. After a few months, the first unit started randomly resetting. As in, I would notice that the garden was not watered in the morning and when I checked the unit, it had reset itself to 12:00 AM and lost all of the programmed settings. I replaced it with the second unit and it started doing this within a week or so. Finally I purchased a brand new one from Amazon and found that it did it within the first week! I am not sure if they are receiving too much direct sunlight or what, but despite the covers being down and no rain, they are unable to work without regular intervention.",2.0
"My existing timer used for my fountain lights finally failed after 4 years and I ordered this as a replacement. However, the plug receptacle is unnecessarily recessed so that the adapter on the fountain light set couldn't plug into this timer all the way. Accordingly, it was unusable. Found the exact Intermatic one that burned out and ordered one as I know the receptacle will accommodate the small AC adapter.",2.0
I bought this to control a 1300 Watt instant hot water at my kitchen sink. Looking for energy savings.  No need to heat water in the middle of the night.  I have no complaints with the product except that I bought it January 9 and it died somewhere around February  11th.  I am going to contact the manufacturer.  I will update my rating depending on their response.,2.0
It is what it is I guess. It's a light sensitive timer but I ended buying what I wanted which is an actual time timer for heat lamps for my chickens so that I can set them to come on intermittently or only at the coldest times of night; this is more correct for path lights etc,2.0
The on off switch failed after three days. The rubber insert does not function as it is not well designed.,2.0
"I am about ready to stop ever purchasing auto timers.  Outdoor use?  Hah!  Stopped working in 2 weeks, hard to turn the wheel.",2.0
"This works great after I figured out how to set it - FYI the directions are hidden look under the plastic...
Honestly, Im not great with these things so maybe you will be fine - just figure I tell you about were the directions are it will help !!lol",2.0
The timer settings aren't even close.  If you set it for 8hrs it cuts off within an hour.  I couldn't return it because I was using it to light an outdoor Christmas tree in our gazebo and didn't think to check the timer...I did check the sensor and it worked fine.  Disappointed to say the leastt,2.0
"Bought this 2 years ago to control turning my bug zapper on at dusk and off at dawn.  Has sat out in the weather along with my zapper for 2 seasons now, still works great.

My only complaint is that it does not remember the last setting if you unplug it.  We have momentary power outages pretty frequently, so I always have to remember to reset it after any outage so it still comes on/off at the correct time.  It's a minor inconvenience, I still highly recommend.

*Update*
After four years this finally gave out on me, so I replaced it in spring 2015.  The new model sucks and stopped working within just a few weeks.  Went back to a cheap mechanical timer.",2.0
"This device gains one to two hours a day.  Since I frequently adjust the on / off settings, I can correct the time.  But if you are away and expect this device to control anything accurately, forget it!",2.0
The product is not working probably. It won't shut of or start on when the the timer is set. I have to plug it and in plug it to use it.,2.0
"As far as I can tell, since I obviously don't sit outside all night, the timer only works for 2-3 hours before turning off on the dusk to dawn setting.  Entirely possible I have a bad unit, but didn't notice until I was past return, and it seems odd that it would work every night for a couple of hours before shutting off.  Using for an electric bug zapper.  Could be not rated for as much juice as I'm using?",2.0
"It works for about a week then it keeps tripping gfic, have to reset the unit to work correctly not worth owinig",2.0
I had to return the unit as it would not complete a cycle. Not very reliable. I purchased a digital timer instead.,2.0
"This timer was easy to program and worked great on my pool pump for about one month, then it just stopped.  I will return and replace it, but at this point, I am not sure that I will select this same timer again.",2.0
"This is ok. Sometimes it shuts off and turns back on by itself. I bought it for a bug zapper. If I set it on the ""Dusk to Dawn"" setting, which is the entire reason I bought it, it continuously shuts on and off. So, now the only thing it's good for is an on/off switch. I would NOT recommend it. At all.",2.0
"It will only turn on 2,4,6,or 8 hours after dusk.  No way to adjust to for pre-dawn. I'm not using anymore.",2.0
The cord is far too short. On my outside outlet it ends up hanging upside down allowing rain to get into the plugs that should be facing down...is this making sense?,2.0
"I purchased this at a local hardware store to operate the Christmas lights outside. Followed instructions to a T. Would turn the lights off at set time but not on. Played with it several times over the course of several days. Found out that if I pushed down lightly in the center of the dial, it would turn the light on (if actual time was within the range set on dial for the lights to be on). Poor quality control. Was going to return it but after the 4th day messing around it started to work properly. It did work properly for the next several weeks around this past Chrsitmas.
I would get a digital one next time. Decided to keep only because the place I bought it was an hour away and it decided to start working. You get what you pay for. I think it was $6 on sale.  One other note: The plastic cover over the dial looks like a weak spot. Would not be surprised if it breaks off or deteriorates and falls apart in a year or two.

*** Update 1 year later (12-7-2013)*** Junk! Well, I pulled it out the other day to hook up the outdoor Christmas lights. Does not work. Same issue as before. Have to tap on it to get the lights to go on or off. If it's on and I let the lid snap shut, the lights go off.  I brought it in the house, set it to go off and on every half hour on a lamp as a test. Dial turns as time passes but does not turn lights on or off. Junk. I retract above statement that you get what you pay for. I did not even get that!
Of course it was 2 days past the one year warranty when I tried it again. In defense of the manufacturer, they did offer to replace if I return old one. It will cost me $3.60 in postage to get a $12 item replaced. I could not get through on phone to mfg. after multiple tries but they did return my email message within 2 days.",2.0
"I am on my second Woods 50013 Outdoor 24-Hour timer and both units ""reset to F every 3-4 days. No power outages and nothing unusual to cause this to happen"" as reported by another customer review. I am returning and will not ask for a replacement from Amazon. Called CCI Woods (1-800-561-4321) and had to leave a message. Called twice and never talked with a customer service rep.

Update: Received a call from CCI Woods customer service and the issue with my defective Woods 50013 Outdoor 24-hour timer was not resolved nor was a replacement offered. In all fairness to CCI Woods, I also purchased two Yard Master Outdoor 6-Outlet Yard Stake with Built-in Timer and both work flawlessly. They get a five star rating as well as my recommendation to purchase. I don't recommend the Woods 50013 Outdoor timer.",2.0
"Giving two stars only because the item is sturdy and weather resistant.

"It works, but is a little bit of a pain.  I went the cheaper route and am wishing I spent the few extra dollars to get one with a knob to hold with the other hand.

As a side note, my primary use for the product has been to trim down doors that stick when opening/closing.  Again it works, but one with a knob would have been much easier and faster to use.",2.0
quality was fair. Just not sharp enough for a small job. I had to push very hard on some pine wood and ended up with sore fingers and wrist. No good. It is very cheap so OK. Just another toy for me to do some exercises.,2.0
"Purchased this to try to shave the top of a door down a bit to get it to fit better. Didn't really work very well and I don't think I'd buy this plane again. There's not really a good way to grip it whatsoever, so you're limited with what you can do with it.",2.0
This planer  is was too small.  It's for toddlers to be honest.  I had to return mine.  So disappointed.  I wanted it to plane the paint off the door side where the lock is.  I definitely need a larger one,2.0
"It is so small, like a toy. I guess it is only for tiny works. Did not work for me.",2.0
"Looks larger than picture seems. Pretty useless for any type of trimming. Blade doesn't lock in place well, no directions how adjust correctly. Waste of money sadly.",2.0
Impossible to set the blade evenly.,2.0
Miniscule,2.0
"The tool does the job. It's not poorly constructed, but cheaply constructed.",2.0
Has a tendency to get the blade stuck and no amount of trying to move the thumb lever will get it to budge. Then you have to take it apart. It's a re-occurring theme. We've since switched to other manufactures.,2.0

Not to mention, I had no idea how to even put it together!  Being someone new at this, it would have been nice to get even a little thing of instructions.",2.0
"Maybe I should have known better. I was trying to plane a guitar neck base down with this and it was much too slim. Also, very difficult to use. I imagine if someone is using this on the edges of a solid wood door it would be doable but not ideal.",2.0
"I'm not sure what it would be good for, but planing wood is not one of those things.  It's just too small.  There's nothing wrong with the build quality, though.",2.0
I bought this plane to shave some cabinet doors down (they were only rubbing a bit).  This was hard to use because it was small making it hard to hold and awkward/impossible to apply even force.  A dud for my job.,2.0
"I bought one of these when I installed Pergo in my house to do the trim.  It was very frustrating to use.  First off, it's very hard to use if you are just placing it on the ground.  Although it's hard to tell from the picture, it's got an L shaped base that's meant to mount on a bench.  If you use it on the floor, the cutting surface is at an angle.  Also, I found I frequently ended up cutting into the plastic of the box. The wallbase I was using was too tall to fit in the box upright, so I had to do the 45 degree cuts using face cuts.  The saw would really squeek on these cuts.  I ended up buying a better Craftsman miter saw, and only wish I'd done so sooner.
This miter box might be alright if you just have to do a few cuts and want to save money, but if you have to do any significant amount of money, save yourself the frustration and spend your money on something better.",2.0

"Image and description do not Match. Image shows Stanley on Blade. Received has none.
Image and description say holes for pencils, etc. ITEM does not have these slots.
Not matching what they say and show",2.0
Bought this at Lowes because I needed it immediately. The saw itself is fine but the plastic mitre box is junk. The guides for the saw move around so if you are cutting a larger piece there is too much play in the box. Works okay for cuts on small pieces.,2.0
"this box is not very sturdy, which makes it hard to use. It just doesn't work worth a darn!",2.0
"As previously stated, it's too small to use for tall baseboard or crown molding. It will take a 3"" tall or 4.5"" laying flat piece of wood. The plastic frame is not rigid so it bends during sawing and causes the saw to bind. The saw is cheap, I have an old rusty mitre saw that still cuts better. May be useful in a pinch if you have a few cuts in a thin piece of quarter round, but otherwise not worth the headache. I'm returning mine.",2.0
"The miter box itself may be okay, but I did not enjoy the provided saw.  The plastic eccentric posts didn't line up nicely with the sizes of trim I was cutting.",2.0
"I bought this knife (and paid exorbitant shipping) only because it was listed as high visibility green, and I couldn't find anything but gray in my local stores.  It's not high visibility green, it's standard gray, just like the picture.  The seller offered to refund my money if I sent it back, thanks but no thanks given the item price vs shipping!

Trying to load the knife was difficult, I couldn't understand the tiny picture that was the only instruction given.  Perhaps I did it wrong, perhaps not, but the sliding gizmo that retracts and extends the blade does not move smoothly at all.",2.0
It's made of lightweight plastic and the saw is ineffective.  I ended up using a saw that I already owned.  Using the Stanley saw would have taken me much longer to cut the cedar boards.  I agree with other reviewers who said this mitre box is only for very small jobs.  You're better off buying something else.,2.0
"It works but seems to ""clog"" up with the shavings rather that let me continuously use it I have to stop and clean it out every few minutes this is lame also the blade had a chip on the one edge so I spent like 30 minutes sharpening and finishing the blade. Almost looked like a factory convex grind and not a chisel grind don't know for sure. Would not buy this again would just buy a better one and save the trouble.",2.0
I bought this to aid me in a DIY project. I bought some bamboo blinds for my new place and figured I could save some $$ and cut them myself to size. Saw this and though its just what I needed! Well the saw SUCKS. I must of gone at it for 15-20 minutes before I realized my kitchen scissors were faster. I'm giving the box another chance and buying a different saw.,2.0
"I like the guide for cutting, but you might as well use a butter knife to cut with.  Saw does not cut thru wood at all, would not cut thru much.  Saw is basically useless.",2.0
"The box is good. It does what it needs to do. However, the saw is utter garbage. I started cutting and after 1 piece of wood, the saw was extremely dull. I couldn't finish my project. What goods is a saw if it is too dull to cut my finger?",2.0
"Did NOT get a blade with it. Cheap plastic too. Looks Like the metal grey ones they
used to sell back when but quality is not there. Not worth purchasing, imo.",2.0
"This does not come with directions!!  I had to wait for my husband to come home to put it together.

Works great when you can put it together",2.0
"This is a weak example of a box cutter. Just so you know, it doesn't come with even 1...not even 1, blade.",2.0
no blades,2.0
"The box cutter itself does the job it needs to do without any problem.  But the fact that the cutter comes with ZERO instructions or diagrams makes it useless for those who, like me, don't use items like this very much.  If not for the user questions and answers below, I would never have figured out how to get the cutter to work.  You need to unscrew the large screw on the side and very carefully remove the black holder and the blade (which is actually hard to see: silver against silver).  Then you need to position the black holder and very carefully place the blade over the holder.  Then screw it back together.  How was I supposed to know this without a diagram?

The packaging for this item needs to be completely redesigned.",2.0
"bought this to do one bathroom.....did not get but one piece of trim done.  The blades on the saw are soooooo big that it looks more like you could go out and whack down a tree with it!  You spend more time cutting parts of the mitre box for some reason, as I had yellow shavings everywhere.  Needless going to go get a much better one that does not ruin my trim.",2.0
Item came broken.  I had to fix it.  It works well now.,2.0
Piece of crap and apparently doesn't come with blade?,2.0
Not made like they used to. Fit is loose and had to resharpen and level it out.,2.0
"I picked up this mitre box and saw at the local home-improvement store over the weekend. It's a cheap product and it shows when using it. The plastic body of the mitre box is quite mediocre and flimsy. The saw is serviceable, but I've had mitre saws in the past that worked much better than this. The clamps are pretty worthless. I recommend paying more for a better combo. I'm surprised at the drop in quality of these Stanley tools, but they are being manufactured in Asia these days.",2.0
Rated based on feedback from my friend who did a small upholstery job for me & insisted I order it. It's mine now!,2.0
You have to screw and unscrew from the handle in order to have the blade exposed or sheathed. Super annoying and quite unsafe to leave it sticking out. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra cash to get one with a retractable blade.,2.0
"I was very happy to find this combo since it was exactly what I needed. However, it is almost unusable since the thin plastic moves around so much while sawing. Saw does not seem to bite well either. Took surprising effort to saw through quarter round stock. A lot of thoughtful touches went into this which makes it all the more disappointing that the execution is so bad. Returning for something of better quality.",2.0
"This works ok once you put it together, though all the parts except the blade itself are plastic so I don't have a lot of faith in its durability, however what I had an issue with was putting the darn thing together. There are no instructions and honestly it's ridiculous to have to spend half an hour trying to put something together that could have been shipped intact.",2.0
"Just about junk.  It is possible, with the investment of a lot of time, to make this tool usable, but it is probably impossible to make most of these work truly well.  I bought two, figuring I might need to mix and match parts.  The blade comes from England, and is not terrible, but it is not very flat on either side.  The blade can be sharpened with usual stones or other sharpening system.  You will need to lap both sides flat and then take the waves out of the bevel and hone and polish it.  However, the rest of this tool very bad, and very time consuming to get into a working condition. The sole is not flat, the bed is not flat, and the cap iron is not flat.  While the sole is ground, the other bearing surfaces are thick paint, obscuring pitted castings that will take a lot of work to get into usable condition.  You must remove the paint from the cap iron so that the iron supports the blade properly and will allow the bade to be adjusted.  That is possible, starting with a fairly coarse side of a grinding wheel and working through the stone grades.  It took a good 40 minutes to get it flat.

The bed for the blade is all but hopeless.  I was able to get it filed down close to flat in about an hour.  The problem is that the bed angle does not match the angle needed for the blade, so you have to remove a lot of paint and metal with a file.  The throat opening is narrow, and most files are too thick, so you are reduced to using a small file.  In the end, it sort of works, but nothing like a good tool should. The bed should be milled by the manufacturer instead of concealing the ill fitting parts with thick glossy paint.

After 4 hours I am able to get a reasonable shaving on edges for rounding off corners, but I still have a lot of work to do to get the tool into proper condition for my intended use, which is to remove bandsaw marks from a slightly curved chair back.  The current setup is prone to chatter and chips jam between the plane and bed due to a mediocre fit of the blade to the bed.  I finally finished the chair back with a cabinet scraper.

If you love to fiddle with poor quality, then this is the tool for you.  You would probably have better luck with one of the older Stanley 151 before the manufacturer thought that paint was the same as proper machining and casting.",2.0
blade is too short to fit in my honing device.  hard to sharpen,2.0
"This knife comes with no instructions, so you get a screwdriver and there is a plastic piece inside and I've tried putting the blade in and screwing it back together and the blade keeps falling out, which is dangerous. it is cheaply made and mine will not hold the blade securely. I won't recommend this!!!",2.0
"poor fit, warped castings",2.0
It dissassemebles with regular use,2.0
"The plastic button to extend the blade is not very strong. I barely got one use out of it before the plastic wore out and the blade retracts.

I was using it to cut drywall, I'm sure it would be fine for boxes or something softer but it did not work for the use which I ordered it for. I had to go to Lowes and get the FatMax version which has been great.",2.0

"I am a carpenter by trade, and unlike the previous 2 star reviews, I am well aware that this tool isn't meant to cut clean through drywall, rather it is meant to score the paper face of the drywall to make the final cut nice and clean.

My complaint about this product is what I can only assume comes from a lack of product quality control.  The adjustment knob that locks the pin is incredibly stiff (to the point that I had to use a set of vice grips to loosen it).  Additionally, the adjustment knob is shaped similar to a flying saucer and the edge of the 'saucer' is very sharp.  On other circle cutters I have used, the outside edge of the knob is similar to the edge of a quarter, and the ribbed edge seems to make it significantly easier to make quick adjustments.",2.0
"I am a do it yourself person and usually ends up with tools for every project.  The project for which this was purchased was putting in 30 can lights throughout our house.  Looking back at it, I should have gone with something that can cut holes quickly and without creating a mess....anyway....this tool is good for marking a circle in the drywall but it doesn't have the ability to cut all the way through.  I ended up using a drywall saw on every hole.  Useless tool in my opinion.",2.0
I liked the idea of using this to cut holes in my ceiling to install in-ceiling speakers.  But this tool is very hard to us and it barely cuts through the sheet rock.  You really have to push up on it hard and it still hardly cuts through.  I do not recommend this.  I had much better luck using a roto-zip tool and bit.,2.0
I was disappointed with the adjustment knob.  It is made of rubber and very hard to turn.  The directions that came with the plane were very poor and almost useless.,2.0
The magnetic properties are very weak. Would not recommend it.,2.0
It works but I just am not impressed with this spoke shave I feel like it dulls easily.,2.0
"The hole for the screw that holds the thing together was not centered, and the cover plate (whatever the name) did not touch the holds at the bottom no matter how I adjusted it. The result was that the thing skipped like crazy, even when sharpened and ""tuned up"" to deal with all the inconsistencies in the tool. Glad it slipped out of my hand afterwards and snapped when it hit the floor, cause I'd rather just buy something better than spend another minute trying to make it work.",2.0

"Low quality but what do you expect for the price (and Stanley tools).  I've spent 2 hours with 320, then 400 grit wet/dry sand paper and my jointer table bed trying to polish out the bottom of this plane flat and smooth.  The surface, as delivered, was very rough; can't see this going over wood very easily. The bottom appears to be flat, but the edges polished out before the middle.  The blade is delivered at 25 deg bevel, with instructions to hone to 30 deg before use, so you must have honing stones and a holder.  Haven't honed yet (or used it) so not sure how the blade will hold up or how well it planes.",2.0
"I guess you get what you pay for.

The sole was ridden with machine marks and it took me a couple of days to sand it down until the marks were gone and the sole was truly flat. So, while it can be done, it has to be done.

As someone mentioned, the knob controlling the blade is made of plastic and it is all but smooth. For some reason it gets stuck now and then.

The blade is a standard blade for a Stanley #4, so nothing to complain about there,",2.0
"1. The sole is not flat. It is curved in every direction possible and is absolutely out of square to both side faces.

2. Something is simply wrong with the design of the adjustment knob. Its very hard to control the thickness of the shavings.

3. No adjustable mouth.

4. I tried to flatten and square the edge of a very short piece of pine (joint) and just couldn't do it. I am no super expert so I cant really put my finger on what exactly was wrong but I just couldn't do it. Also, I know this plane is not meant for this job, but honestly, I am 100% sure a good number 4 could handle the job.
I ended up taking my block plane and it took me exactly 30 seconds to get the board dead flat and square to the face.

Dont buy it.",2.0
"I read review after review about what a wonderful tool this is.  But I don't see the value.  I've used old-fashioned draw-knives  and they do a better job, more reliably and quickly.

This is basically a plane with handlebars.  It can shave quite a bit of wood (the wood will have to be clamped) but it does so very roughly rather than smoothly.  The blade will require adjusting prior to use; it doesn't look like the factory spent any time getting it to working level before shoving it out the door.  It works best when the blade is just below the plane bottom; in this position it removes wood fairly well.

PROS:
* Well-built and sturdy
* Good-quality blade
* It works... kinda

CONS:
* Adjustment system is cumbersome and difficult to use
* Blade does not come properly adjusted from the factory
* Handles are narrow and uncomfortable to use
* A standard plane does a better job for fine work
* A standard old-fashioned draw-knife does a far better job for stripping and wood removal

In short, this is an unnecessary tool that tries to replace a draw knife and a plane with one low-cost tool... and fails in both aspects.

If you're looking for a tool like this to shave wood (ie, a ""spokeshave"") I recommend a regular double-handle 10"" draw knife.  They'll cost more than double what this tool costs, but will do the job better.",2.0
"I own numerous stanley planes and the ones but decided to go against my better judgement and order this one. The blade was chipped as hell. Like someone was planing a nail! There was a good 1/32 inch gouge along the blade... Not sure if I want a replacement or should I spend the time to take off 1/32"" off the length of the blade.",2.0

"A chronic problem with microplane cutters is that if they use metal thin enough to cut quickly, there is a substantial risk that the user will press down too hard with both hands and terminally deform the planer.  I have done this many times myself.  Stanley protects against this by making planers that are very tough (thick metal) and by opening each hole only a tiny amount, limiting the depth of the bite one can take with each stroke.  There is a time and place for that, and if you are a rough user, this might be your best bet.  However, with a little more experience with these tools you will find that the pressure should be exerted along the cutting axis, not downward (against the wood or plastic you are shaping).  If you push along the cutting axis and carefully limit the pressure against the material, you will find that Stanley surform planers cut at only a small fraction of the rate obtainable with other brands (e.g., Microplane).  The high rate of material removal possible with the other brands is very satisfying, especially if you are set on doing a lot of shaping.  If, however, you just need an occasional chafe, and are prone to ruining tools with excess pressure, Stanley surform planers are a better choice.  I have both types, but rarely use the Stanley.",2.0

"Out of the box, it wasn't even close to ready-to-go. I couldn't get it to move across my boards at all. After honing the blade, all it could do was take small chunks out of the wood.

I get it, planes require tuning and honing before use... but why? In my opinion, if it doesn't work, it shouldn't be sold.

I noticed that the plane is made in England. Although that sounds great on the surface, I've found a lot of mass-produced English products to feature strong, high quality materials but relatively crude craftsmanship. No offense intended, it's just a trend I've noticed occasionally (I used to live in England). In any case, that seems to be true here.",2.0

"Weak. The bottom is so not flat that it's useless without hours of grinding and prep work.

The left / right adjustment is very imprecise and poorly designed.  Also, the wood chips take the paint off. I know it is affordable, but it at least has to be able to do the job. I probably wouldn't buy another Stanley plane, even a higher end one, because I am suspicious of the quality control. Steel seems decent.

"Better than the nearly useless home depot brand, but quality is barely passable.  The blade started to chip and round over when I hit small knots in pine as soon as I started using hit and the locking mechanism on the bade iron looks like it will only last a few sessions of hard use.  I had high hopes for this.

Incidentally, I was sharpening the blade for this and my dad's old smoothing plane.  The steel on this is just whatever was cheapest on hand in China, while my dad's antique smoothing plane blade is made out of some really hard and tough steel.  My dad's smoother blade was difficult to sharpen, while it ate knots for breakfast.

Finally, the sloppy lockup on the blade makes it annoying to square the blade to the plane every-time I adjust the cut depth.  I suppose you get what you pay, but I was hoping that this would be the exception to the rule.

Unless you're only going to use this once or twice and throw away, I'd buy something that is better quality.",2.0
"This plane looks sharp and you might be tempted to think it's a good buy, perhaps better than what you might get directly from Homedepot for $30.  You'd be wrong.

"I know this plane was inexpensive, but I was hoping for a little better. I ordered this Stanley Block Plane as well as the Stanley Sweetheart Low Profile Block Plane.

This plane is roughly machined, not even close to flat, the blade is heavily burred, and there is slight rust on the sole plate. I know, you get what you pay for. I started trying to flatten the sole plate last night; I spent over an hour sanding it with 100 grit on top of my cast iron table saw table.  After an hour, I have it nearly flat, but decided to quit for the night. I will continue working on this, sanding the base and filing the throat as needed. Sharpening the blade shouldn't be too big of a deal (I generally expect to do that on a new tool) though it was quite jagged. My guess is that I will probably end up investing at least 3 to 4 hours ""tuning"" this tool before it is ready to use. Don't expect to pull this plane out of the box and put it to use.",2.0

"This product does what a good rasp does, remove material in a rapid but controlled manner.  However, having read the reviews before purchasing, I was conscious of the possibility I would have a problem with the handle, and sure enough on my first hickory stick (bow making) the handle has started to wobble even before I had it floor tillered.  I unscrewed it and yes, the plastic screw hole is beginning to split and probably won't last another hour.  I went online looking for a replacement metal handle, looks like I will have to make my own out of wood or more likely, just look for another product.",2.0

"I like giving good reviews but I honestly can't do that here. Firstly, it was very hard to setup. I had to bend the frame with all of my weight to get the blade to fit, and then the blade broke after a few cuts. I put one of the replacement blades on and that one cracked within a few weeks. I gave it two stars because it comes with 4 blades and got me through some tricky projects, but this is definitely a cheap saw. You get what you pay for in this case.",2.0

This saw is not a good choice for wood working. the blade move around constantly unless you tape each side down. I probably won't use this saw again and will most likely buy a different one.,2.0
I picked through several tape measures in this price range.  With little else to separate the competition I elected to purchase this one due to its being made in the USA.  At least that is what the product description said.  I discovered upon delivery that it was in fact made in Thailand.  I have been an avid woodworker for 20 years and have worn out a few tape measures in that time.  I wanted one made in USA because they are typically higher quality and will last longer.  Upon inspection this item does not measure up to the quality of the Stanley models I have owned in the past.,2.0
"Basically, this tape measure will do its job.  It will help you measure things.  But the lock does not work well.  It does not hold the tape steady, so do not use it for important jobs.  Or for jobs that require you to measure long distances alone.  If someone else is holding the end, then you won't make a mistake.  Otherwise, this tape measure is a shameful product.

I remember having a strong, well-made tape measure by Stanley.  I guess they only make cheap junk now.  I wish I had gone to the Depot of Homes to actually handle the thing.

DON'T BUY.",2.0

"The printing on the tape is very poor quality.  I will not comment on the rest of the product since it is entirely worthless without good rule markings.  I'm sorry I bought this product.  I would have purchased a different brand had I found one that had an english scale on top and bottom.  Unfortunately, the other brands tend to be english and metric, which I do not want.",2.0
"I won't buy any of the Stanley tapes that have the kind of packaging this one has. Obviously it's an attempt to reduce theft at the store, but the degree they zipped it up with the back paper glued to the plastic is totally unnecessary. Good luck getting the paper backing off. Then to make matters worse, they totally encased it, all around the tape casing and then added more plastic that was inserted into the belt clip was locked onto the plastic. Even using scissors all around didn't help much.",2.0
"I concur with the other review about an inaccurate description of this product. It is not a metal case just plastic made to look like metal, had I known this beforehand I would not have ordered it.

"I had used one of these tapes for quite a few years, and was very satisfied. But recently, when I was extending it fully to measure a deck, ""sproing!"" the tape fell off, and when I took it apart, it seemed the spring had failed as well.

So I went out and bought another one, thinking the first had just exceeded its lifetime.  The second time I used the new one, fully extending it, the tape fell off. Taking this one apart, it looks as though the  metal piece that is supposed to lock with the tape end had broken off, although the spring still appears to be functional.  Other reviewers report similar problems. So now I don't know whether to try again with this tape or try another brand.",2.0

"I am a construction superintendant for a pool company.  I use my tape for quick measurements maybe 5-10 times a day.  This tape was great for about a week, then is started to get sticky.  After another week it split lengthwise and caused a pretty nice cut on my finger when it was retracting.

I thought this was a good deal, I learned my lesson and will be going back to the more expensive tapes.",2.0
Button does not hold tape measure in place...it still wants to retract with button pushed down. Otherwise works well.,2.0
"The tape measure snapped after a year of use. Worked perfectly fine as a tape measure, until it didn't. I was retracting the tape one day after taking a measurement in the attic and the tape broke off near the end. It looks like the manufacturer's warranty requires mailing it back, so it's not worth the trouble or expense. Recommend either buying from a manufacturer with a useful warranty or from a store that allows returns for warranties.",2.0
"I could not imagine what could be wrong with such a simple device as this tape.  But it happened that you cannot measure something without help if you try to hook one end - it does not remain hooked. Also, the lock barely holds the tape in place. A poor workmanship.

"Short Version- It works, but I wouldn't buy another.

PROS- It's good and bright, and stands out of the shelf.  My tired old eyes sometimes have trouble seeing the thin black MagLight laying around, but, even in the dark, can always spot the bright yellow trim on the DeWalt.  Its held up well (purchased 2013.  Finally,  stands well (stable), using the heavy battery as it's base  ***HOWEVER *** see my Con below.

CONS-  Swivel head will only rotate to raise the beam, not lower it.  This means if you have the light, and a 2 item on the same plane.  The main beam will pass OVER the item, unless you lay the light on its side. Now aim adjustments are a real pita.  Ive run into this problem so many time, Im downgrading it to 3 stars.

BULB ISSUES- I bought this mainly to exercise my DeWalt batteries, so I have no comparisons with other similar lights. I've had none of the problems (2 star reviews) with bulbs or quality.

USING WITH 14V BATT-  The smaller batt will latch in (sort of) but I don't recommend it. It must be carefully latched (wiggled in, and 'pull' checked). Otherwise it can fall out, in accordance with the 595 th corollary of Murphy's Law, which states  ""A poorly latched battery will fall out at the highest height above the concrete garage floor"" <g>",3.0
I think this is on of the neatest saw Porter-Cable ever come out with.  I have the chrome model and think it's really slick.  I really think it's a shame that Porter-Cable discontinued the manufacturing of the saw.  The size is convenient for the work that I usually do.  And it lends itself to small places.  I'm buying up extra blades just to make sure that I continue to have ample supply.,3.0

"If you are reading this then read it through. Toby's Tool Shed did everything that they could to make my purchase and refund go OK. Delivery was great, refund was great as well. Normally I swear by Dewalt tools, however, this particular one was broken inside of the factory box. No damage to the shipping box and no damage to the factory box as well. Probably an anomaly, but that's why I gave an average score, not for the seller but for the product.",3.0
"Does what the product says but there's no speed control, just hight speed only. A REAL wrist breaker using any bit size over 1/2""",3.0
"The ergonomics of the tool are pretty decent and the keyed chuck is quite solid. However, the variable speed feature could use some improvement. At lower speeds, there is almost no torque and when the trigger is pressed a little more to compensate, it revs to full speed. There is very little working range to the variable speed feature. There is also a little more vibration than I would have expected.
I'd often wonder why other folks on construction sites (who were using DeWalt drills) either pulsed the drilling or ran the drill at full speed. Now I know. I also know why they would prefer using my Bosch and Milwaukee drills.
This tool was a gift and will be a backup for my other drills. If you are doing delicate work or need to drill at a steady speed, I would not recommend this drill. Both Bosch and Milwaukee have superior variable-speed switches and run more smoothly (although they cost a little more).",3.0
"There are a few saws in this class that essentially do the same thing. There may be a slight difference in weight, a brake or not a brake, and this model has a case. This saw has good power and a nice case to keep things neat and tidy. There are a couple of caveats. Adjusting the depth of cut is a little tricky and a bit difficult to get to just where you want it. And the depth of cut has to be at the max in order to fit in the case. Lastly, the brake doesn't appear to do a whole heck of a lot. As a saw it is perfectly fine and the case is worth the extra dollars.",3.0
Not a bad drill for the price. One downside is lack of adjutment to not drive screw thru sheet rock.,3.0
I use 2 of these as worklights. They could really use a magnet or at least some kind of hook to keep them in place. They tend to move around too easily. They are bright and excellent when hanheld but they are heavy due to the 18V battery.,3.0
"After a great deal of research, I decided the DW364 offered the best design (greatest adjustment flexibility, good power, sturdy materials, and best reviews of the top-rated saws) for a price that is within budget.  However, my new, unused saw is at the Dewalt repair store having a few parts replaced. The saw I received couldn't be adjusted to make a 90 degree cut. After briefly reviewing the trouble, the repairman's first comment was (paraphrased): ""badly designed part; will have to replace it."" I also asked him to replace the shoe, which wasn't flat. Everything else looked OK. All of my other Dewalt tools worked correctly out-of-the-box. I hope to have a great saw after the repairs. Why should a new saw need repairs?",3.0

"A year ago I purchased a very cheap ($50.00) scroll saw to see if I would like scroll sawing as a hobby. I did, so this year I decided to upgrade. Prior to purchasing my new scroll saw, as my Christmas present, I thoroughly read all the reviews I could get. After careful review it looked like the hands down winner in my price range was the DeWalt DW788. A number of the reviews indicated that the saw had minimal vibration compared to other saws, along with a number of other good features. Some reviews indicated you could balance a coin on its side. Contrary to the reviews, my saw definitely has vibration. Even more that my cheap $50.00 saw. I went to the Baltimore Woodworking show in January and discussed my concern with a DeWalt Service rep. He recommended I bring the saw into his service shop, but he was from Pennsylvania, so he recommended I take my saw to the DeWalt service shop in Baltimore, which I did. Unfortunately the service rep that looked at my saw was obviously not familiar with scroll saws. He didn't even tension the blade while he was trying it out! When I did tension it he kind of gave me a dumb look. Anyway he said there was nothing wrong with my saw. Other than the vibration, which I can live with reluctantly, I do like the saw, and it's other nice features. Especially, the ability to swing the arm up to thread the blade into large pieces.",3.0

"This saw came to me in good condition. No complaints there.  However when I assembled the saw, which was quick and easy, I found that the blade doesn't line up with the center of the cutout in the table.  In fact it is touching the side of the hole.  I attempted to adjust the table by loosening the 2 mounting screws and was able to very slightly adjust it so that the blade was not actually touching, but it is barely clearing the throat opening in the table.  I personally belive that is poor workmanship.  The saw operates but the workmanship leaves something to be desired.",3.0
"I received this saw recently.  Unfortunately, the table was machined poorly, and the blade would not center in the hole in the table.  I returned the saw for a replacement.  The second one had the table machined correctly.  I see this complaint on the scroll saw forums.  It is a shame that Dewalt is having quality control issues with this saw.",3.0

"I ordered this saw online and was sooo excited when it was delivered.  I read all the great reviews and had a bunch of projects ready to go.  I have been using the $150 or less saws for years and was ready to move up to a 'real' machine.  All I would have to do is bolt on the table, insert the blade and I would be ready to create...right...  WRONG!  Read Jay's review written on Nov 6th.  Same problem.  When I bolted on the table, the slot in the table for the saw blade was off center and the blade rubbed against the table.  The problem is a result of the bolt placement under the table is off set and impossible to adjust.  I also read in Jay's review that he returned the saw 2 times only to have the same problem with all 3 saws.  I didn't bother trying to return the saw and modified the holes in the bracket, I don't recommend this as I was barely able to make significant improvement because of the limited room for this adjustment.  The blade no longer rubs but I could only get it about 1/8th on an inch away from the table.  Any side to side movement still causes the blade to rub, decreasing the life of the blade.

I had the 'pleasure' of an additional manufacturing problem.  My saw was delivered without a dust blower!  Again, my impatience pushed me to modify this $400+ saw and use a blower from one of my old non-working saws.

Over an hour and a half after pulling it out of the box, and after much extreme aggravation, I was finally able to use it.

Go ahead and read the good reviews about the blade changing ease, minimal vibration, accuracy of cut, and quietness.  I do agree for the most part...but...anticipate that if you make this purchase online you will have problems out of the box.  If you're not willing to make the necessary modifications you may have serious problems getting a working model.  If you're going to purchase this saw, buy it from a store you physically enter and have it assembled before you get it home!  I have a feeling they (Dewalt) know which saws are defective but instead of recalling them, they are selling them to the online retailers.",3.0

"This is a bum saw to change blades.  Apparently, there was a misdesign in a ""wedge"" inside that keeps the arms too far apart and therefore, the blade is ""too short"".  There is about 1/8 of an inch on each end to fasten to.  There should be 3/8's or so.  The earlier model Type 1 is very good in this regard.  But this later model, the Type 2, is no good.  DeWalt admits there is a ""slight problem"" with blade change but so far, no cure.  We are stuck with it.
Other than the blade change problem, I really like the machine and it runs circles around all other scroll saws I have had or still have.... once the blade is changed.  It takes quite a bit of time and patience to change a blade.",3.0

"I think the DeWalt DW788 is a very nice saw for light hobby work. The cutting is very smooth, all the controls are up front and easy to access.

The only problem I have with the saw is the hold down bar. It is designed in a such a way that if you change thickness of woods a lot, you have to readjust it and this seems rather difficult at times. When you reapply pressure to the holding screw the bar moves down tighter. It takes a few corrections to keep it from pressing to hard on the wood or not enough.

Overall I think it runs very smooth and can be a great addition to any hobbiest looking for a reasonably priced scroll saw.",3.0

I bought this to have a working light that also used the 18v power packs from my various DeWalt 18v tools. So far so good. But it really burns some power, it gets quite warm and the light doesn't last as long and isn't as bright as you would hope.

I also have the DeWalt DC527 fluorescent light, it provides a much better working light, lasts longer and is easier to use to get light on your work. By comparison to the DC527 this is an uneven and yellowish light.

It might as well be said that if you are at the skill level where you are using a router you are at the skill level where you can make this yourself.

Also, there are some mistakes in the assembly instructions - the instructions say to drill 7/16"" holes for the bolts, but if you drill the holes accurately you only need 5/16"" holes. 7/16"" will give you 1/8"" wiggle room, but I think that could cause the connections between the wood and the brackets to easily sag. Another gripe I have is that the mechanism to put the caster wheel on the floor barely lifts the rubber feet off the floor, so if you have any unevenness in your floor the rubber feet might rub on the floor while moving the unit around. My last gripe is that the threaded rods that get used to install the rubber feet are too short - they're about 2"" long, and after putting them thru a 1.5"" piece of wood and putting on the 2 bolts and 2 washers that are used to adjust them, there are barely any threads left to adjust the height with. Overall I like it because I can build it to the exact size I want, but unfortunately it's made in China and there is some room for improvement in quality control and in the design of a few components.",3.0

"I'm a fan of DeWalt, and I own quite a few of their tools and they've performed, and performed well.
This radio has its merits. Tough construction, easy knobs, and charges really well. I also use it to drain my NiCds (just leave the radio on) so they don't develop a ""memory""  for which they are notorious. As well as produces music.
Sometimes. The reception and the analog dial has some room for improvement, okay a lot of improvement. The speakers? Well, how picky can you be when the wind is blowing, planes flying over head, or the ""concert hall resonance"" of new drywall?
All things aside, I would buy this again, not unless a seasoned vet (Sony, JVC, etc) came out with an armor-clad box.

"A friend of mine has one on a hybrid table saw (not as light as a little job-site saw, but not a honkin' cabinet saw either), and it worked great with just Lowe's hardwood (they're oak and sold as 2x2 turning blanks, I think). When I got a used saw, I got this base at the same time, but found that it didn't work as well -- the adjustable levelling feet weren't lifting up enough, and I could see the corner brackets flexing. I knew my saw was a little bigger than my friend's but I wasn't sure how much. I looked up the manual and it says it's 350 lbs. So, I would say that's on the heavy side. The base still works, but I have to push the pedal down hard to get the feet to lift up enough to move it, which I don't really recommend. I would say nothing more than 300 lbs for it to work, and probably 250 lbs max for it to work well.",3.0
I am very pleased with the limited use so far. I purchased a RIDID MS-UV utility vehicle to mount the saw on and the combination is superb for mobility. I am looking forward to installing engineered hardwood flooring and using the saw for the project.,3.0

"Ok, it matches the rest of the saw and it comes from DeWalt.  It is just a light and frankly any light would work on a stand next to the saw.  The earlier comments are correct that it drops too close to the table and won't stay upright.  The gooseneck on it is very tightly sprung and wants to keep straightening out on you so the way it is designed makes it drop toward the table.  It came with my saw as part of package but personnally I don't use it much since it casts a shadow on the work that is very distracting.  My shop is well lit so don't need it and if I did would probably go with florescent to eliminate the shadow problem.",3.0

"I had this saw for 5 years now and I am somewhat satisfied with it.  I cuts very smoothly and I I love the indents and the wide cutting range of the saw.  That said, the dust bag doesn't really work which everyone knows.  But the thing that really bothered me was the guard.  It uses a ballbearing/cam mechanism in a awkward way and if you use the saw alot, the screw which hold the ballbearing strips out.  I had brought it in for repairs once but it didn't last.  I had to alter the guard mechanism to get it to work properly.  If I had my money back, I would buy a makita 12"" sliding compound.  (I used and love that saw)",3.0
"After using this saw for 3 1/2 years I definetly have mixed feelings. the split fence on the left was not in line with the right side and in one piece with no easy fix, a constant nagging problem. But it had a good motor, and adjustability was acceptable. If you notice all my referances are in the past tense, because as of this afternoon the thing is laying in two pieces in my work van. The casting broke at the turntable.  I take great care of my tools, I buy the best and expect them to work very well for a long time as have the many other Bosch tools I own. I will not buy another Bosch chop saw unless they give a pro rated discount on a new one. This saw should not have broken so easily. If you work out of a van or truck,like every other carpenter on this planet does, I can't recomend this saw, it can't stand up to normal handling. If you want absolute accuracy from the fence don't buy this saw it may be hard to fix the split fence. I hope others who have this saw have better luck than me.",3.0
"I purchased the Bosch 3915 several months ago.  It sat unpacked for a couple of months before I was able to get around to using it.  My experience with it thus far has been less than stellar, contrary to most of the other reviews in this forum.  My particular saw will NOT cut square - I've tried adjusting the fence and the bevel zero stop but cannot get the blade square to the table or fence for the full length of stroke.  The blade twists right to left just slightly as it travels through its stroke (slide).  This indicates to me that there may be a misalignment problem with the slide rails, something that cannot be adjusted by the user.  Not only that, the fence casting is crooked - you can lay a straight edge on the table against the fence and there is a small gap on the left side.  I've contacted Bosch about this but have not heard back from them yet.  Since the saw isn't cutting square, you can imagine what sort of problems that presents when trying to do finish work such as mitering crown molding.  I looked at several other saws in addition to the Bosch and selected the Bosch mainly on the strength of its user reviews and the electric brake feature.  At this point, I'm disappointed with the overall performance.  Don't get me wrong, I do like the saw but for the money I paid, it should at least cut square.  I'm hopeful that Bosch will have some suggestions for me about how to get the saw either adjusted properly or repaired so that it will cut like it should.  Otherwise, I'll probably talk to Amazon about returning the saw and exchanging it for something else.  It looks as though I may have gotten a ""lemon"".",3.0

"It is a great base but: 1. they short you on parts ( I had to buy $5.00 worth of bolts). Unfortunately this is the best of the lot  in mobile stand so I have bought three of them and in every one I have been shorted on nuts and bolts. In fact the list of parts says there should be 18 bolts and there are in fact 18 bolts, however, there are 24 places you need bolts. I don't mind the extra $5 for nuts and bolts it is the aggravation of having to stop putting it together and go to the hardware store that is bothersome, 2 the directions are terrible. They tell you to do things that you have to undo later ( for instance don't put the wheels on as they say because you only have to remove them at a later time which they don't tell you;3 Even using a drill press it is virtually impossible to get all the holes to line up. I have been woodworking for years but I only get 15 or 16 of the 20 holes to line up no matter how careful I am. The mobility is good and the thing is strong.

"Did not fit my new DWS780. saw is not threaded and I chose not to drill and tap a hole on the side of my saw. I would have used a Helicoil but I didn't have a M8 handy so I think I'll just send it back. I guess I'll just go back to clamping a board on the saw for crown. Drilling and tapping the base wouldn't be too hard but I shouldn't have to. Well maybe I can overcome my stubbornness and just tap a new hole. A bit and tap would cost more than the crown stops.

"From the moment I pulled this saw from the box my heart sank a little bit. With a street price in the $120 range, I guess I expected a bit more than the average $40 DIY type circular saws offer, but that's what my first impression was.  Other than the ball bearing construction in the gear housing, it's built like a average saw, has the features of a basic average saw, and basically sells from the virtues of it's small size.  It does offer an interesting design that fills a niche though.  Having the blade on the left side makes the cut line very visible, and it's light enough to easily handle with one hand most of the time, which is a good thing because there's no designated knob or handle to safely place the left hand on the saw.

The motor is somewhat underpowered...you squeeze the trigger and instead of springing to life, the blade ramps up to speed a second or two later.  The same lack of power also leads to easy slow down of the blade when it encounters challenging materials.  I didn't expect it to react like a 15 amp motor, but I hadn't expected it to give such an impression that it's weak.  It'll do a reasonable job with plywood and even hardwoods if you give it ample time, but if you push it moderately hard, it'll bog down fairly easily.  It's more comparable to an average consumer grade battery powered cordless saw than a 120v corded model.

The stock blade is as cheap as they come.  Motor power and saw blade quality pretty much determine the performance of any circular saw, and this blade doesn't even have carbide teeth.  To add to the woes of the HD5510, the selection of aftermarket blades that will fit this saw is severely limited.  Features and accessories are just about non-existent.  It seems as though this saw hasn't been updated in over 20 years, which would be ok if it didn't still fetch a premium. It's time that Skil added some new features to this saw...possibly some dust collection options, an 8 or 9 amp motor, a laser guide, edge guide, composite shoe plate, and/or possibly a nice carrying case to make it more competitive with the PC345, PC314, Makita 5005 and 4200, and the Ridgid Fuego.

The HD5510 is a mixed bag for me.  Compared to a 7-1/4"" 15 amp saw, it's nice and light, easy to control, and can make most cuts if not pushed too hard, but it's fairly weak and offers little in the way of convenience features.  I managed to squeeze a decent quality 6"" Freud Diablo 40T blade in by removing the blade guard...definitely not a move I'd recommend, but it's what I felt I needed to do to make it function to my satisfaction. Another 25%-30% more power would be welcome too. I bought this saw sight unseen based on many positive reviews, but other than the benefits of it's lightweight, I don't feel that it offers anything to merit its $120 price tag. If I'd had the opportunity to scope this out in person, I think I would have passed and opted for the PC345 or the Ridgid 3400...both more expensive (though not by much), but both offer quite a bit more saw than the Skil. It's not a bad saw, it's just fairly expensive for what you get, and I'm disappointed about the value.",3.0
"The saw is rough with blade installed (no matter who's blade or bushings).  This says bearing problems to me. I contacted Skil and we went through the paces. Skil said it was a bad saw, so don't accept this saw if it runs rough with a blade. It is not supposed to do this.
The 30 day return policy is great, and the process with Amazon is very easy.
My only problem now, is do I try this saw again, go for another brand, or just keep using my 7-1/4.........not a good spot to be in when you get a lemon.

Addendum one:
Was looking for another trim saw and came up with the Porter-Cable 345 SawBoss but it turns out it is having the same bearing problem, so don't get your hopes up for this one either.
I just may have to spend the big bucks and go with a Makita!!!!!!!!!!!

Addendum two:
Took a chance and ordered another HD5510 and it runs true.
Craftsman used to make a corded 5-1/2"", but does not any more, so you are
very limited in your choice options unless you want to pay $300.00 for the Makita.
I have upgraded by one star to three, but due to the initial bad saw, can give no
higher rating.

"The saw itself is a wonderful addition to anyone's arsenal. It is powerful and light enough to use all day without getting fatigued. The adjustments work smoothly and the controls all seem to be in the right place. But...(and it's a huge but), you will really have a hard time finding the right blade for it. In fact you will have a hard time finding any blade for it. It uses a 5 1/2"" blade with 1/2"" arbor and while finding 5 1/2"" blades is difficult enough...finding one with a 1/2"" arbor hole is downright impossible!  Even Skill seems to have forgotten about this saw and it's loyal group of followers. They only carry a cheap steel plywood blade and an 18 tooth version of carbide as far as I can tell. You will be able to find blades with 10 millimeters and 3/8"" holes or you will find 5 3/8"" blades but trying to find a 5 1/2"" quality blade 24 tooth (or more) with a 1/2"" arbor hole will make you pull your hair out. In the end it's a nice saw but none of that matters when it comes time for your next blade so I'd have to recommend going to Porter Cable and their 6"" Saw Boss or down to a cordless 5 3/8"" if you don't want to waste days trying to justify your purchase.",3.0

"I got this for my delta shopmaster table saw which has a base diameter of 26x28.  The base once constructed is solid and stable with the hardwood (used Oak).  Remember - the price does not include the wood - which is about $20 more.  Mine was missing 6 lag bolts from the HW bag.  Shotty QA before shipping I guess.  Frustrating - I had to run out and buy them in the middle of construction (I wasn't about to return the thing for that).  This is a good base, but not the best one in my opinion.  With only the one wheel it is a bit clumsy.  I got the HTC2000 for my grizz bs which moves around a lot better.  Plus the construction time was half since I didn't need to drill 20 holes with the drill press.  My HTC2000 has a much smaller footprint though with the bs so not sure how that would hold up on something as big as what I am using this delta base for.  Total cost is cheaper for the HTC though ($60 for the HTC, versus this one which is total cost of about $85 - base is $60 here, wood is $20, and extra bolts are $2  ;-)",3.0
"Should copy the one offered by Rockler.  It has an easily removable jack wheel that can be removed in about 10-15 seconds to get it out of the way and/or used on another mobile base.  This could reduce the overall cost if one needs more than one base.  There could be a little more attention paid to the manufacture so that the holes line up better, and there is a small problem with the bends not allowing it to all be at 90 degrees to the bottom and consequently the when the lumber is inserted, it is not square and plumb to the adjacent piece.  The instructions SUCK, but they shouldn't be needed for any intelligent person.  If you can't put it together without the instructions, you probably should not plug in any of your power tools.",3.0

"Really there are two problems with this unit both associated with the instructions.. The angled corners accept slightly larger than 1 1/2"" stock in one dimension only!  Must be sloppy if you cut to 1 1/2"" sq per the instructions.  Also if like me you followed the instructions without unpacking the parts you drilled the holes too large at 7/16"" and then you're told that the levellers need 5/16"" but then they go on to talk about all holes being 7/16. I've stopped my assembly now tht I have exrtra large holes and will complain to Delta.  Really expect better than this from them of all people.",3.0
"I bought this base because I could cut the wood to fit, and because it was available locally. The biggest thing is that unless you have a drill press to cut perfect holes, you may end up doing a lot of trial and error. Even with a level on my drill, I couldn't quite get them perfect, and had to widen the holes to compensate. I imagine a drill press would have made short work of this problem. As a result, my frame was a bit crooked, but it worked. The other problem is the caster. The whole thing rolls fine if you're pulling it towards you, but when you have to push, the wheel spins around, which decreases the ground clearance and made the feet rub the floor, even with the feet retracted as far as they could go. My saw weighs 200 lbs. The base says it holds 300 lbs, but I wouldn't recommend it. Get an all steel base for really heavy items and use this base for lighter items.",3.0
"The directions are pretty bad, the photos almost useless.  Leveling feet will probably need to be counterbored (not mentioned in the directions).  For my contractor style table saw it works pretty well, but for my 6"" jointer it doesn't stay up in the rolling position when you try to move it.  The milling of parts (stamping, actually) is pretty weak too.  The holes in the wood needed to be reamed out several times to get the bolts through, because the holes in the metal brackets don't line up square.  They're useable now, but they took much more time to assemble than I had anticipated.  A few simple fixes and a new set of directions are all that are needed drastically improve the quality of this product.  I'm disappointed.",3.0
"The is a great idea and basically serves the purpose I needed out of it.  But I must say that I am disappointed.  The caster wheel only lifts the rubber feet up about half an inch.  This is fine if your shop floor is perfectly flat.  But mine is not - it has a sloped curvature that leads into a drain.  So the rubber feet drag a little whenever I roll the machine near the drain.  Sometimes I feel like I'm dragging the whole thing with the ""mobile base"" providing minimal assistance.  Again, this is probably not a problem if your shop floor is perfectly flat.  I can probably jury rig it somehow with a little thought, although I am busy on so many other shop projects at the moment.

Oh yeah - assembly was quite an ordeal.  The product itself is simple enough and the instructions are fine, but keep in mind that you are probably dealing with a heavy piece of equipment.  The instructions have you lifting and moving your equipment on and off the base several times for measurement and fitting, which is not fun if you're working alone.  I suggest you either have a few friends around, or think intelligently about how to tilt your equipment on and off the base without hurting your back.",3.0
"I did not see the reviews when I bought this as it was an accessory I saw next to the Delta table saws when I bought my 10"" Delta TS at Lowe's on sale a couple weeks ago. I did not find buying exact dimensioned wood hard other than stomaching the cost of four-square surfaced oak at Home Depot prices. For my saw base which measured about 28"" by 26"" at the feet I appeared to need four  2x2 ~30"" length pieces and decided to use oak for strength/stability. They sell these for about $10 a piece at the local Home Depot by me, so the net cost of the base doubled to nearly $100. Still, it's a very solid thing and should hold up fine. I also happened to buy a 2nd base a Shop Fox G7314 which costs about $70 and requires no additional wood when I bought my Grizzly 14"" band saw a week or so later at the Bellingham, WA store, so I can compare those two products. The Shop Fox doesn't require additional wood or marking or drilling. It's all pre-drilled and metal and takes maybe an hour to assemble - the Delta base took me 2-3 hours to completely assemble, including some hard tamping with a hammer to get the carriage bolts threaded through my not totally precisely aligned 5/16"" holes in the wood (by the way the directions tell you to drill 7/16"" holes but the included hardware make it obvious that they must mean 5/16"") and a 2nd trip to Home Depot for wood. If you have 1-1/2"" x 1-1/2"" squared wood close at hand and need a really odd or custom table, this base for $50 is a good deal. But this base doesn't come with lock washers like the Shop Fox does and I wonder how long before I need to do something about the hex nuts through the rails starting to loosen and come off (if they do maybe I'll just slip a little epoxy in the threads and reseat them - ain't enough space on the bolt to space a lock washer anyway.) The Shop Fox is heavier duty and it accomodates the dimensions of the tool stand/table you are mounting on it and need the heavy duty (400 lbs - 600 lbs load), it's IMHO a better fit for most large tools/cabinet stands and comes with lock washers space for them on the bolts. The one thing I like here is the convenience of the foot pivot brake release. The Shop Fox uses a dual adjusting knob on each of front swivel casters that you have to bend down and loosen /tighten each time you want to lock / unlock it from fixed base position. I might check out the HTC2000 or possibly the one that General if I can find it somewhere else as those seem like kind a ""best of both worlds"" hybrid possibilities for what I liked best about this one (the foot brake) and the Shop Fox (fast assembly, flip lock brake, all metal pieces included, no additional wood or drilling time needed).",3.0
"I have to say that this product works great now that I have it all put together. I'm giving this product three stars for two reasons. One is that it was missing the leveling feet. Not a big deal since I can still use the thing while I'm waiting for the missing pieces from Delta. Based on other reviews, missing parts seems to be a conistent problem with this product. The other bigger issue I had was size requirements. I bought this for my jointer which has a base that's 12.5""x17.5"". Unfortunately, the minimum width (the dimension where the foot lever resides) for the mobile base is 16"" and nowhere in the documentation or on the box does it say anything about minimum size requirements. I had the wood cut and ready to assemble when I realized this.",3.0
Perfect,3.0
"I have to say that this product actually works fine once you get it together, but boy what a lot of difficulty. The pieces  are bent steel, but the bends aren't ninety degrees, really, and this complicates assembly needlessly. I had to grind sloppy welds in a couple places just to get the pieces of wood in place. I bought them because I feel the three wheel design is the best for ease of use, but I wouldn't buy them again. Hopefully, some other company will make a three wheeled base (one foot operation and easier pivoting) without the necessity of drilling so much (20 holes per base and a lot of marking etc.)",3.0
"The sander went together easily and all the parts were included in the package.  My sander sits on a sealed concrete floor, and the vibration when running caused it to slide around the floor.  I placed the legs on a foam sanding pad and that put a stop to the sliding around.  The sander itself works well and seems to have plenty of power.  The dust collection works well enough to keep the dust out of my shop, so overall I'm quite pleased.",3.0
"To start....I have to commend Amazon for the quick shipping and ease of transaction. My first disappointment was that the package it was shipped in was almost destroyed. The box was crushed, interior foam crating was broken up, and the box was coming apart at it's seams. I was worried about the unit escaping damage. It seems I was lucky. A unit as heavey as this needs a better container for shipping. Set up of the machine went fine...but the instructions were a bit ambiguious. The reference letters from picture to picture differed, so you had to pay attention in assembling the stand. I realized that the pricing of this unit meant that quality was going to be lower than some of the other more expensive models.....but I did expect it to work. After putting it together, I test ran it. I was troubled buy the motor sound. It seemed to struggle to get up to speed when first switched on....then as if by magic, it clicked, and ran smoothly. I didn't get much chance to investigate any further because the belt drive pulley on the motor shed it's outer guide flange, causing the belt to derail. I was bummed. I knew I had to repair the shipping container in addition to taking the unit apart and sending it back for replacement. After jumping through all the hoops....Amazon had a new unit at my door. (Kudos to Amazon's painless process, by the way) Well, upon testing the replacement, I noticed the same strain on the motor, (unable to come up to operating speed), that the former unit had. How could I get two units with the same problem?? I knew something was not right in the start-up mode of the motor's electrics, and put in a call to Delta's tech line. After the tech heard my description, she came to the same conclusion as I. Either the Capacitor or the relay was not working properly. She sent out new relay and cap, I installed them and the motor now works the way it is supposed to. Starts smooth, and reaches proper rpm. (No more weird elec smell either) Another issue I had was the sanding table was not flat, making square edges nearly impossible. After some time sanding it on a surface plate, I managed to get a flat table, and some square edges.....but I feel that a person should not have to go through these efforts. (Again....an aspect of a cheaper product.) Only time will tell how well this product performs. Were I not an ""able"" tinkerer, I would be completely disappointed. The average person should not have to deal with this stuff. But, alas....this is today's market.  I will say...Delta's tech support, and Amazon's return procedure deserve praise.",3.0
"I do not have experience with the other universal unit but it certainly has to be a better deal. First,Delta did not supply enough nuts and bolts. Disappointing because ... they certainly could afford it! Second, adding the ... cost of the oak for the rails this is a very expensive unit! Quality is fine. But quality control i.e. missing bolts is poor.",3.0

Dewalt is good but why does Amazon have to bait us and mislead by its claim of a higher retail price of 189.00. It sells everywhere at no more than 99.00,3.0
"The Purchase/Shipping:  Amazon made this easy and efficient.  The price was discounted from retail and they offered a shipping incentive. The sander was shipped immediately and I received it within a few days.  It was carefully packaged.

Assembly:  Fairly simple.  The parts list on the first page of the manual incorrectly describes stand parts, so look carefully at the pictures in the manual, and follow the instructions.  The sander itself is partially assembled and simple to complete.

Quality:  The attachments are acceptable, but some of the plastic parts are not well molded and don't fit snugly.  This is not a particularly big deal, because the plastic parts aren't under stress.  The stand is adequate.  The rest of the machine is well-made.  One caveat: there is a fairly large gap between the pressure plate and the rollers, and this allows the sanding belt to bow, which can cause ripples on the surface you are sanding.  Practice with old 2x4's or other scrap to get a feel for the machine.  Also, the sander I received came with one incorrectly-sized metric bolt, which held up the assembly until I found the correct bolt at a local hardware store.

Function: A powerful machine.  It comes with an 80 grit belt and disk, and it's a good idea to pick up some finer-grit belts/disks.  The sander cuts fast, puts out a lot of wood dust, and is loud.  If you use it in a closed area, hearing protectors are recommended for work that takes more than a moment to complete.

Summary:  Overall a good performer.  The attachments, manual and stand are only adequate, but once you turn on the sander, you're too busy to worry about its details.",3.0
"I always had a picture in my mind of Delta tools being the ones to buy if you could afford them. As my first Delta tool purchase this one just didn't live up to my internal hype.
On page 10 of the manual, it says the screw for changing the position of the sanding arm can be adjusted with the supplied hex wrench, but I found that the screw was the wrong size. I called Delta and they sent the correct part (part #1346365).
I also ran into the problem mentioned by another reviewer where the parts for the stand are labelled differently from picture to picture. Too bad I didn't read that review before I assembled the unit. It would have saved me a lot of time.
All-in-all it seems like it will function well, but it's not as perfect as I'd hoped it would be.",3.0
"I needed a stationary sander, and Delta's 31-695 was the unit that was in my price range.  It went together well, and sands satisfactorily, but just seems to lack something.  I didn't want to spend the nearly $800 for the Delta sanding center, but in the long run..., I probably should've held out.  The cast aluminum table for the disc sander is flimsy, and does not adjust well to angled sanding.  I've already stripped out one of the retention knobs and have noticed a little difficulty with belt tracking.  Other than those issues, it's OK, I wouldn't purchase another one though.",3.0
"I bought mine on the retail market because it was immediately available (no wait for shipping). After assembly it ran about 10 seconds before all the smoke came out. Two months later I got it back from the Delta warranty repair shop, and it seems to work fine. Hard to believe that Delta could not get a motor in less than two months. Removes stock quickly, and can do the same to an unguarded knuckle, but overall a good tool if you need to get a flat surface on any kind of wood in a hurry.",3.0

"My review will mirror some of the thoughts in other reviews.

These are quality clamps, very well-built and easy to use.  They provide the safety you'd want while working with the saw.  They do seem a bit pricey considering the size and simplicity but it's easily worth it.

The only real ""cons"" I have is that I expected to be able to clamp items closer to the blade, rather than 4 or more inches away.  Now for anything over 6 inches away from the blade I'm comfortable using my hands anyways, so I was buying these clamps with the hopes of getting them in fairly close.  I also expected the clamps to ""get out of the way"" so that when I'm making complex cuts I don't have to work around the blade or motor hitting the clamps.",3.0
Well built and would be great on most crown. Was unable to use it on 7 1/4 inch crown because it would not adjust away from the 12 inch double bevel miter saw far enough.,3.0

"This appears to be a v. good driver, except the manual is very poorly written and the illustration insufficiently informative. In addition, the plastic sleeve that adjusts the depth of the screw was so tightly screwed on that I has to mount the driver in my vise and use a wrench to unscrew it. Once this was accomplished the driver works as expected. The manual would not even be required, except the overly foreceful assembly as indicated above made me doubt if I understand the function of the parts.",3.0
"I have owned and heavily used over 5 miter saws in the last 10 years. This is my first power tool that is made in China. Quality is a little below my expectations for Makita. The angle dentent lever flexes, which allows play. The blade guard is thin and unreinforced. The angle indicator arrow is sloppily painted. Angle lock screw handle is cheap feeling. Alignment out of the box is lacking. I only will put up these issues because it is super light weight and I have a wrecked back. Some positive aspects are very high motor quality and nice machining on the base/ table and fence. The best power tools that I own are Makita. Those are all made in Japan, USA, and Taiwan. I have tried all of the German brands with lackluster results. Now I usually buy Dewalt due to their return to US manufacturing.",3.0

Good tool but its too heavy n bulky,3.0
"The product is great! strong and sturdy.
However it is small. if you are making small corner cuts you have to use large pieces anything smaller than two feet will become scrap. also for large molding it does not extend far enough out. the max size molding is 6.25 inches tall which is a space of around 4.75 which is max distance the stop reaches. my molding is right at this distance and i am not getting a clean cut. i debated just making a jig for it but decided to just work with what i had.

end result - it works and is strong aluminum bracket just not great for all applications",3.0
"After reading some of the reviews I decided to buy a Milwaukee 0234-6 Magnum Drill to replace my ancient Craftsman.  It arrived from Amazon in only two days after ordering.  It looked solid and heavy, the kind of drill that would last me the rest of my life.  But upon further inspection I found the product label read, ""Made In China.""  Now, I'm not going to stand on my patriotic soap box and start screaming about companies outsourcing their products to other countries.  Its happening more and more and if a company chooses to do this, it is their legal right to do so, even at the risk of disappointing thier customers.  However, I do believe Milwaukee Co. and any company selling their foriegn made tools are obligated to make their customers aware of this.  Nowhere on the box or Amazon description page does it say that this drill is ""Made In China.""  And the fact that the ""Made In China"" lettering was so small on the label (I had to use my reading glasses to confirm) further suggests that Milwaukee is concerned about losing customers over their once American made product(s).

Is there a difference between the two drills?  Maybe, probably not, who knows.  But I couldn't in good conscience keep this drill. I felt duped.  I sent it back to Amazon and found another seller who bought a bunch of US made Milwaukee 0234-6 Magnums just before they began manufacturing them in China.  This may seem like a waste of time to some, but I just couldn't handle the idea of keeping this drill for the rest of my life knowing it was outsourced.  I want this to be my go-to drill and I knew that if I kept it, every time I picked it up I would think...Milwaukee sold out and I rewarded them for it.

So, I am taking off 1 star for Milwaukee's less than full disclosure, and 1 star from Amazon for the same reason.",3.0
"When my imported drill died, I remembered the excellent Milwaukee hole shooter I used to use at a job long ago. I remembered the excellent service I've got out of a USA made Milwaukee circular saw and USA made Milwaukee Sawzall. My local big box store didn't carry the Milwaukee drill I thought I wanted, so I ordered it from Amazon thinking that I was going to get another fine product from Milwaukee. Well, right beside the line that says Milwaukee Brookfield IL is a line that says Made in China. I'm not at all happy that this renowned professional tool supplier has chosen to outsource product. It would be one thing if they were offering a lower cost line that was outsourced, but this 1/2"" drill cost significantly more than the similar competition, and I bought it specifically believing that it was a quality USA made product. It's an import with a plastic housing not terribly dissimilar from other more obvious imported drills offering more features at lower prices available locally.

That said, it does seem to be well made and has already proved capable of easily running a 2 1/2"" hole saw, a 3/4"" ship's auger bit, and a 1 1/4"" wood boring bit all through 2""x4""s and 2""x6""s, as well as plywood. It's also run a 1/2"" metal bit through 1/4"" mild steel without a hitch (though that did take awhile). Overall, I like the drill, but I wish that a company named after an American city, who built their reputation on American union labor wouldn't outsource to countries where their external costs are completely hidden or would at least be honest enough to put that in bold print on the external advertising. For me, this is the last Milwaukee anything, since even though I like the products, I don't trust the company any more. That's indicative of just how far we've fallen as a country, if even the brands named for our cities aren't made here anymore. Good buy Milwaukee. You were once a fine brand.",3.0
"This review is based on having used this saw, a Makita 13 Amp Sidewinder Circular Saw 5007NBKX4 and the Dewalt 364K 7 1/4 ""Sidewinder"" Circular saw.

The Skil saw, as all the other reviewers have attested, is powerful and, because of its power, rewarding to use. However, it still has its limits. For example, I tried out all three circular saws on very, very GREEN hemlock 1x10 stock. Where there was ""reaction wood"", the wood tended to clamp closed as quickly as the cut was made. The Makita came to a complete standstill as the wood clamped down on the blade. The dewalt continued to spin, being among the most powerful of the sidewinders, but still could not be pushed through. With the Skil, on the first try, the blade came to a standstill as the engine continued to spin.

We tightened the blade.

On the next try, the blade squealed like a stuck pig, spinning with more authority than the Dewalt, but still could not produce enough moxy to finish the cut (maybe if the board had been clamped, two of us could have forced the Skil through). All machines have their limits. Despite the other reviews, don't think that this saw will make you invincible.

That said, the three stars is for the shoddy shoe on the Skil saw. This is not a quality tool. Until Skil puts some serious thought into improving the shoe, save this saw for the butchering of 2X stock in big crews where production is paramount. The depth is difficult and inexact and the bevel gage is a joke. Worse yet, the shoe tends to warp on these tools (as was the case with the Skil saw I tried). It could not be relied on to make square cuts in our 4x stock.

Buy the Dewalt if you are only going to have one saw and can live without the testosterone rush of the Skil saw. The Dewalt has an excellent shoe. It's depth adjustment is easy, accurate and without rival. It's bevel gage is also unrivaled and easy to set and reset. (Accurately setting the bevel on the Skil saw will require a separate tool or jig.) The Dewalt has power *and* refinement.

If you are going to have two saws, however, then make the Skil saw your second. You will find a place for both.",3.0
No fence?  Why does it say 1/3 hp motor in one place and 1/2 hp in another?  What is the maximum space between the uper guide and the table top?  What range of blade sizes will it carry?  I hope everyone has answers  to those questions before they buy.  Thanks,3.0

"I purchased the Makita 7 inch hook and loop polisher primarily for use on my car. The product arrived quickly and was well packaged. I attached the handle easily and purchased three different buffers for use with this product.

Unfortunately, after only two uses, a strong melting plastic smell was emitted and the buffer started to spark. I was extremely disappointed that the product failed so quickly. Both times I used it were extremely light use (once to buff out a scratch on my car, and the second was to polish a glass cooktop).

I am lucky enough to live within a 30 minute drive to a local Makita repair center. I brought the buffer in and they explained that the motor would have to be replaced because of a defect in the original one (a loose part that caused the previous motor to fry). They were extremely helpful with the repair and they had the refurbished buffer ready for me within 2 days.

Overall I am still disappointed that I purchased a top quality product only to have it fail almost immediately. I had to take the time to make two trips to a repair location (about 2 hours of driving), but I do feel lucky that I had this option. If a repair center was not nearby I would have been out of luck.

Now that I have a defect free unit the buffer works great. It is extremely powerful and solid when used, and I love the variable speed. I have used it to buff my car, refinish my granite counters and stove top, and even clean and buff an old tub. Next time I make a purchase for a tool like this I will definitely check to make sure they have a repair location nearby.",3.0

"This clamp is a very clever idea - Holds the piece upright while you cut it.  However, as it came from the factory, the right clamp was not properly aligned.

I still use it.  Just need to put a piece of spline in when cutting aluminum and heavier items.

Oh well - Maybe I'll find another one at a yard sale.",3.0
"I'd love for this to be a better review, but it isn't.  This saw is not up to Makita's usual level of quality.  Several things are apparent:
1. The vertical hold down does not extend far enough to clamp 4/4 stock.  This is a problem that makes the hold down all but useless for me.
2. The work support extensions are not supplied with the say, they are a $40 optional accessory.
3. The saw is cheaply made, way too much plastic and not much adjustability of angles for any but the presets.
4. The casting finish and paint are sloppy.

I have owned several miter saws over the years and this is the poorest of them all.  My $99 Ryobi lasted 15 years and was twice the saw that this one is.  I may keep it as a traveling worksite saw but It it won't see any use in my shop.

My advice is to spend just a little more and get something of higher quality.",3.0
"I purchased two of these for our business. One broke when used and started to smoke.

"I bought this to mount a Delta drill press. It really is too low for this purpose. It is designed for a shorter person I think. If you are 5'7"" then the height might be perfect for you, but for a taller person, it will seem way too low. It may be a good height for other things like a band saw. Hard to tell. Anyway, this is the same complaint I had with the Delta Grinder stand that came with the package deal. These products seem to be sized for short people and have no adjustment built in to make them acceptable for taller people. I will probably build a floor platform to raise it up.

The next bad surprise was that although the top is loaded with numerous bolt holes for different tools to be mounted to it, there was no set of holes for my Delta benchtop drill press. Very strange! I wound up having to drill my own holes. If it is not compatible with one of their most popular products, then I wouldn't expect it to be compatible with anything. This way you are on notice to expect to have to drill some holes, and if not, then you lucked out.

I'm giving this 1 star more than the Delta grinder stand because here I could simply drill more holes, but with the grinder stand, the top plate is way too small for the Delta grinder and I have to fabricate an adaptor plate.

The price is too high for what you get, but this was the same complaint I had as well for the grinder stand. I think that Delta makes these for a few dollars (it is only sheet metal and angle iron with some bolts) and the rest is markup so they make a nice profit off the accessories they sell. Nothing wrong with that, but keep it in mind that when you are shopping for a stand, that there may be less expensive options that work just as well if not better than this stand.",3.0
"I used to attach a piece of wood to my mitre saw table with hot melt then gut the middle.  I decided to buy the real deal.  I like that you can remove them mid-job for the occassional flat cut, but I had trouble with one of them slipping away from the back fence if I applied too much pressure.

"I ordered this recently and just opened it up today.  Based on a very minimal amount of usage so far (A few minutes at most,) it seems to be a decent and solidly built product.

Also, it doesn't come with any accessories (pads, etc) right out of the box, so it's pretty much useless as it comes.  It would have been nice to be able to use it right away.  I think the description should have been a little clearer about that, I was expecting to be able to use it without spending more money on additional parts.",3.0
"I own several Delta tools, including the 12 1/2"" Portable Planer and 6"" Professional Jointer. I plan on buying a Unisaw this weekend.  These tools are well built and work well so I thought the Delta Mortiser would be a good choice.  I bought mine after Christmas and received it in a few days.  When I opened the box I found the 3/8"" chisel was missing.  Also, when I put it together, I found that when I tightened down the set screw that holds the fence in place, one end of the fence is about 3/8"" higher on one end than the other.  I called the help number and left a message to call me.  In a few minutes, my local rep called and sent a new chisel (Austrian Made no less!) and a new fence...  But, the new fence does the same thing.  It looks like the flat milled on the shaft is square to the bottom edge of the fence, so the hole for the set screw must not be square to the upright post.  I agree that the set screws are of poor quality also.  I figured they were metric, but the sockets are so sloppy that some of them fit S.A.E. Allen wrenches better than metric wrenches. I hope Delta takes notice of these messages.",3.0
"The Delta is very quiet and has plenty of power. The hold down is solid, and the fence is too. Plan on buying a wide-stance stand or bolting the unit to a table since it has a tendency to tip forward when substantial  force is applied to the arm.

Other dealers offer a  ""P"" package for about $10 more that includes 1/4"" and  1/2"" sets of Delta's Austrian-made Chisel/Bits. The difference is  really remarkable. 5 stars for the ""P"" package. 3 Stars for the  ""X"" package. Watch out - the Austrian-made sets are about $40 per  size. Clico's and Multico's are almost twice that. You can easily spend  nearly as much on Chisel/Bits as you spend on the unit.

There is no on-tool bit storage (really dumb). Power is adequate (2.4 v) at best. Plus you would think that for this kind of money for such a small tool, it would be made in USA. Nope, made in Japan.

The blade gruard, nut etc. prevents the blade from penetrating all the way through the wood. Otherwise it is a light weight and durable machine.

"We bought this saw to do some occasional veneer matching when building one-up pieces of furniture.  It was often too time consuming to set up our main resaw (A Stenner) for veneer cuts. We had hoped that the reduced setup  times would pay back the relatively high price for this saw.  The frame of  this saw seems strong enough to use a motor that is larger than what it  arrived with and it needs it.  The saw is under powered to do resaw work on  oak, teak or maple.  In thinking about it later we decided that when a 3""  blade is mounted on these small diameter wheels the sheer power of bending  the blade around two tires must take up a large portion of the available  horsepower.  This is horsepower that is not applied to the cut.  Additionally the blades thin kerf tended to bind on all but the dryest of  woods.  We set the blade wider but then controlling the stock as it was fed  was worse and the new set robbed even more power.  If the saw had cut  better we probably would have found a happy medium but we soon found  ourselves going back to the arduous setups on the 20 horsepower Stenner.  While the details of the guides, fence, table adjustment mechanisms and  dust chute were pure Hitachi quality I cannot recommend this saw for resaw  work. It is a pleasure to use for standard pattern work.  However that can  be said of some bandsaws that cost less than half as much.",3.0

"I bought a ridgid 3x18 belt sander, it was all plastic and got way hot when using.  But it did remove a lot of material and quickly.  That's why I bought a belt sander after all.

It was within the 90 day trial written on the box.

This PC is heavier and more solidly built.  The housing is aluminum which I like.  The dust bag didn't work at all for me, at all.

"After reading reviews about this collector I decided to purchase one. When it arrived I thought the package was run over by the delivery truck! The styrofoam packing was in shattered pieces and there were bent parts everywhere! The round metal down tube pressed so hard against the metal bag holder that it caved in the side throwing it out of round ( it was actually oval!)Also the mounts were severely bent upwards!! I returned it for a replacement and when that one arrived guess what?...The same thing!! The packing material was again shattered and the identical parts were damaged!! This time I just took the pliers with a cloth and rebent the bag holder to round and bent the down tube mounts back. Is it my bad luck with this or does Jet pack certain items in the worst possible way?? I can understand maybe once but TWICE!!!

"I bought this Dust Collector just about a year ago. First, I found it almost inpossible to get the standard 30 micron filters to snap in place. On advice from another owner on this forum I purchased a set of 5 micron bags from Penn State Industries to cut down on dust escaping through the filter bags. These bags although they were advertised to fit the DC 650, by the time you got them in place and sealed with the spring loaded 20"" retaining clips you end up with bunched up pleats which allow dust to escape through. The DC 650 does work well to collect the saw dust produced while sanding on my Powermatic 2442 lathe but I think there are better designed collectors out there that for a few more dollars wouldn't have these design deficiencies.",3.0
"I bought this for a one person shop.  My original intent was to have one hose and pull it to the tool I was using.
1st, If you plan to use cheaper hose in a one tool per time system, the fact that the in-feed is on top of the unit, the weight of the hose will crimp thinner hoses.
2nd, this sucker does not roll for beans. it has 4 wheels two are fixed and to rotate, if you happen to be pulling in the direction that the rear wheels are pointing (Rarely are you pulling to where you already are) you're good, if not your in trouble.
I ran a more permanent system and with blast gates it has plenty of power to run jointers, planers router tables.  Just my
observations.",3.0
"I have decided to take the really small trouble to move the hose from tool to tool, since it is just me there and I have organized the major tools (table saw, planer, jointer) so they have their rear ends facing the same direction. This seems to work fine. The 4"" hose is easy to move and slip onto each tool when I am going to use it, even for a few cuts.
I have added a garbage can pre-collector, so it is a 2-stage system. It is imperfect, even with lots of duct tape, but I am satisfied with the system so far. Maybe because I have been around a while and know things never work as well as illustrated in the catalogs and magazines. It is a GREAT improvement over what I had before (broom and shop vac). I got a Shaker 1 micron bag (on sale at Rockler in January) for the Jet and that seems to be a major improvement. Also I am adding a small Lee Valley air cleaner to snarf up the ambient fine  stuff.",3.0
"Makita power tools have an excellent reputation, and I own Makita's 14.4V cordless drill and random orbit sander, both of which are terrific tools.  However, I think they need to do some design updates on their 3x18 belt sander to make it competitive with similar models offered by other companies.
I purchased this sander, but eventually exchanged it for the Porter+Cable 3x21.  There are several resaons why the Porter+ Cable is better (see my review of that sander).  Here is my assessment of the Makita.
It has pretty good power.  For a belt sander, I found I needed to go back over spots repeatedly where a more powerful belt sander took off more in one pass.  The whole reason you buy a belt sander is to remove material FAST.  However, it doesn't bog down too badly and it does remove material pretty well.
BUT it is made of plastic, giving it less heft and authority, which is an important factor with a belt sander.  The loading feature is awkward on this sander -- you put the sanding belt in place and then it is difficult to lock down just right.
The most problematic feature of this sander, however, is the tracking function.  I loaded the belt, turned the sander on, flipped the sander upside down (as you're supposed to do), and adjusted the tracking until there was no ""sway.""  Then I started to use the sander, and within five to seven minutes the belt was tracking off center.  Now, all belt sanders will eventually track off center, but this one does it too often.  Every time the sander tracks off center, you have to stop working and adjust the belt, so you want to get a belt sander that goes longer before needing adjustment.  This one, I believe, needs it too often.
The tracking problem is even worse with a plastic-body sander like this one.  If the belt tracks off center enough, it can actually dig off a significant part of the sander body.
The handle could be b etter.  With this sander, holding the handle gives you a slight out-of-balance feeling, compared with the Porter + Cable.  Also, the handle is not as prominent and easy to grab during sanding operations.
Makita is is selling this sander for a lower price, which makes up for some of these problems I mentioned.  So it's a choice: are you willing to compromise on some of the nicer features?  If so, you get a sander that has decent enough power to get the job done, but could be better.",3.0
"My Bosch belt sander finally died after many, many planks and they discontinued that model. So I was in the market for a new sander. I looked at the Makita, DeWalt, and the PC one. On the recommendation of a trusted woodworking magazine as well as my thin wallet, I got this. All I can say is it's OK. The PC brand is not what it was, thanks to Black & Decker trying to compete with the Tool Shop brands. This might be my last PC purchase.

Few issues with it:

* Pushing the sander against the board will cause it to slow because it simply feels under powered.
* Sparks will fly if the belt is not perfectly aligned with the wheels (didn't happen with the Bosch).
* Dust collection is PC specific and does not fit regular vacuum adapters.

The last point is the one that grates on me most. To fix it, I sanded down the little ridge that is meant to hold the bag clip in place and was able to use my normal vacuum hose adapter. It made a big difference. I sand epoxy, oil-based wood, and paint, and the last thing I need is this stuff flying around my shop. Yes, I wear full protection but it's not perfect and I still have to wipe all the dust down.

The good news is it feels good in the hands. It's sturdy, made of metal, and doesn't feel like the cheap stuff that PC has become over the last few years as assembly's moved offshore into cheap components. It sands straight and parallel with the work surface and doesn't run off when the button's hit unlike my other sander. I am not sure I would buy this again but it's difficult to justify the extra $70 - $100 for the other models. I'd probably look at the DeWalt if I could have a do over.",3.0
"""Star"" rating is really not meaningful in this review, as I could not even turn on the light to check it out.

"I have had the Porter-Cable 352VS for a couple of weeks now.  I bought this sander to supplement and eventually replace an ancient Porter-Cable 503. The 503 is a great sander and hard to find fault with, except for it's boat anchor weight. The Porter-Cable 503/504 is the standard by which all belt sanders should be judged.

Thus far, I have used the 352VS for sanding some tough Red Oak, probably for a couple of hours total.  Unlike other reviewers, I have had no problems  with balance.  I love the variable speed feature.  Belt changing is a snap.  Belt tracking is adjust-once-and-forget.  Porter-Cable quality is apparent.

Others have criticized the cord exiting the machine on top.  For me, that's where it should be.  The sander cord should be draped over your shoulders to keep it out of the way.  If you don't develop this habit, the sander cord is always going to be a problem, no matter where it comes out of the sander.

Although far from perfect, the 352VS is a capable mid-size sander that performs well.  My most negative impression of the sander is with dust collection, which is poor.  It puts more dust into the shop atmosphere than it does in the bag.  This is a major shortcoming and a health issue.  My old 503 is like a shop vacuum in this respect and leaves very little dust behind, and it's 30+ years old.  I see no reason why the 352VS shouldn't perform just as well or better in this respect, but it doesn't.  There is an up-side, though.  It may be weeks before I have to empty the bag.",3.0
"The good news is that I owned a PC352VS for 14 years and it served me well.  I bought another one last week after the bearings on the front pulley failed on old faithful...not bad after 14 years.  The bad news is that the new model DOES NOT provide a connection to a shop vacuum as did the old model.  The dust collection bag is absolutely worthless.  My shop and lungs were rife with dust after 10 minutes of use.  The port happens to be exactly the same size 1 3/8"" OD as your typical shop vac...1 3/8"" OD.  This is, in my opinion, a terrible design flaw by PC.  I did find a solution however that I will share with you.  I bought a 1 1/2"" PVC pipe coupling which has an inside diameter just shy of the 1 3/8"" OD of the PC and my 1 1/2"" shop Fein shop vac.  I used a Forstner 1 3/8"" bit on my drill press and bored the ID a bit bigger on the PVC coupling.  Voila, a nice connection which cost about 73 cents.  I gave the new model only three stars for two reasons...first, this real design flaw and second because my PC Customer Service email asking for a recommended solution or adaptor went unanswered...never have heard back from Porter Cable.",3.0
"I replaced my old Craftsman belt sander after 15 years (wasn't broken, just wanted something newer and ""better"" before the old one broke at an inconvenient time) and thought P-C was the way to go without breaking the bank.  Dust collection sounded cool, too, since my old unit spewed sawdust everywhere.  The P-C is nice in that belt changes are easier, the variable speed control is handy, and the unit has a solid feel.  It is a bit quieter than the old Craftsman.  While the bag does catch some dust it's still a messy tool (I haven't hooked it up to my shop vacuum yet--I'm hoping for dramatic improvement and will update my review to 4 stars if that works well).  I've been spoiled by other old tool upgrades where the new outperforms the old by soooo much, so I was underwhelmed in this case.  Doesn't mean it's a bad tool, but just don't expect miracles.",3.0
"Having had this sander for five years, its greater usage this year brought about its near demise. Used only for what it is designed to do (planar sanding of individual pieces for paint removal and/or finishing), frequent usage highlights its shortcomings.

1. The sander is difficult to lubricate and runs hot. After 15 minutes of running time, it starts to smoke when, no way, can the housing be touched.

2. The open drum is problematic; the user has to be constantly mindful of the cord so it doesn't get caught up in the housing.

3. The tracking wheel is easy to adjust; nonetheless, the belt is apt to track continually from side to side.

4. The machine is somewhat heavy, not well balanced, and tends to wander toward the motor-side, requiring firm two-handed control and more downward pressure than advisable.

5. The bag, despite the fact that it swivels, interferes with sight-lines. This, plus the tool's weight, makes sanding the undersides of an attached planar edge impossible.

For me, the solution to these problems will be the Bosch 1274DVS 3"" x 21"" Dustless Variable Speed Belt Sander.",3.0

"I have a lot of Porter-Cable tools, my dad has them too. Therefore I thought this would be a good inexpensive sander.
It's heavy which is good, it tracks well which is good, I like variable speed... BUT!
It's not balanced well. Left unto it's own weight it will favor one side over the other and sand unevenly unless you get a feel for which side needs a little more pressure. Use finer paper and take it easy. I started to develope a feel for it but never really enjoyed using it.
I now use a very old Porter-Cable 504 given to me by my dad. It's been a joy to use! $500+ new gulp! Mine's old, has been serviced and will live on.
If I were looking for a belt sander and didn't want the 504 due to preference, price, or going the used route, and I were trying to get something good within reason, I'd try a higher end PC or check another brand. I think DeWalt, or Bosch have settled those balance issues. You can feel it in your hands and hold it gently on a flat surface get an idea as to what may stay flat when the power is on.",3.0
"Needs reengineering, caster wheel and bracket to flimsy buckled and bent under load on second time I moved the saw. (They should have used a stronger caster wheel and bracket assembly.

"The mobile base construction in general is OK but unfortunately the China crap fabrication left the table extension part of the mobile base resting at an upward angle from the saw mobile base when assembled together with no means to make an adjustment. This causes the wheel mechanism used to raise the entire mobile base unit not to have enough travel to lift the mobile base off of the pads to make it mobile, which is the whole point of a mobile base in the first place.  I called Delta and tech support said they don't deal with accessories, what the heck???  They said to get a replacement from wherever I purchased the item.  So I am getting a replacement from Amazon.  It shipped out today, the same day I submitted the claim, to Amazon's credit.  I will have to wait and see if the replacement is any better.

Received the replacement last night.  UPS mangled the box it was shipped in and some parts were missing, I presume they fell out of one of the holes in the box.  I will use the missing parts, bolts and a wheel assembly, from the original unit to get the replacement in operation. The mobile base was a little better as far as upward angle of the extension to the saw base.  I guess I will buy some shims and try to get the mobile base extension level with the saw mobile base.  I would prefer not to do this because the weight of the whole saw is on this joint when the mobile base is raised to move the unit but I need to get the saw set up and operating.",3.0

"Got this tool yesterday from Lowes. Just ordered the Makita from Amazon. Needless to say I am not thrilled with the DeWalt and will return it tomorrow.

I had a Milwaukee close quarter for almost 25 years and loved it. The switch broke and the unit would not reverse anymore. All Lowes had was the DeWalt so I took it. I am installing cabinets and needed something for tight spaces.

The unit has a decent ergonomic feel to it, though very different from the Milwaukee I am used to. Has some weight in the hand, but the power seems less than even an 18v cordless, though it did drive some 3.5"" screws fairly well. It just sounds like an inexpensive, low end drill.

The two main problems? The switch is a strange bird. It is rather impossible to get used to. Change hands or turn the drill and the switch is completely different to grab. The VSR works well, but the switch makes it difficult to find a sweet spot time after time driving small screws from different angles. Plus, put the drill down wrong and off it goes! I tend to always hold a right angle drill upside down to change bits, so no problem in hitting the trigger accidentally. But picking it up wrong, or when changing hands it is very easy to engage to paddle.

The second thing is the chuck access for the key. 3 notches cut out of a shroud that surrounds the chuck. You have to line up the key hole with a notch or you cannot put the key in. But trying to turn the chuck by hand to line up the nothces is rather ridiculous because it's hard to get at. A very odd design.

Just reading reviews I am sure I will like the Makita better, if nothing else to have a centrally located paddle switch. If the Milwaukee was still made, I would get that hands down. The new Milwaukee has a very large paddle switch that looks like it just has too big a footprint for changing hands and picking up without accidentally engaging it.",3.0
"I have used this tool for several years, and bought it instead of the Milwaukee close-quarter drill because the DeWalt seemed to measure a little less in depth, which I preferred for access to tighter spaces.  I generally like the DeWalt, but the reason I only give it three stars instead of four or five is from what I perceive to be a safety issue.  The DeWalt has a large switch trigger (the large silver colored thing in the photo) which is helpful when working in close quarters, but you have to watch what you are doing when you go to pick the drill up.  There does not appear to be an interlock on the trigger, and I have had several occasions where just picking up the drill caused it to start because I inadvertently activated the switch when picking up the drill.  Luckily there were no serious consequences.  It seems to me that this tool should have an interlock (at least I didn't see one)  such as on some right angle air tools, that require a lever or similar to be flipped before the paddle switch can be engaged.",3.0
"All the saw blade companies offer stabilizers. Some users swear by them, others think it is just a profitable little extra to sell.

We all know they cut down on the depth of cut. Another thing to consider is that on some brands of saws you may have to remove spacers to accommodate the extra thickness and this effects other attachments on the saw as well. Switching back and forth from using the stabilizer is not always that easy.

My own tests, done on both a table saw and an old radial arm saw,  are inconclusive. It made no difference on my one expensive 1/8"" wide blade, but did cut down the noise on one of my cheaper, real noisy thin blades. On better quality thin blades the difference was less noticeable.

Are the cuts actually better? Hard to tell. Normal variations in the feed rate and accuracy in the feed seem to make more difference. The goal of a perfect cut is always somewhat elusive anyway unless you set up each cut like you are making a part for NASA.

On the other hand, some people do have the time and patience (and equipment) to make those machine-shop cuts and why not use a stabilizer as well? It can't hurt, and the noise reduction alone might be compelling for some people.

I have used mine on a few occasions, when cutting my rare piece of really special wood. It works fine and makes me feel better. Makes the sound of sawing more...sort of expensive-like. That's worth it sometimes. It just isn't absolutely necessary.",3.0
"The Freud SC-001 3-1/2-Inch Blade Stabilizer is a well manufactured, simple product. It certainly improves blade stability. The blade feels firmer once installed. However, adding these to your table saw will likely require a large amount of effort that isn't well mentioned in previous reviews, unless I missed it.

One reviewer recommends adding only a single stabilizer on the outside of the blade. I tried this, out of curiosity, and quickly discovered that this warps the blade by a significant amount, since the built-in stabilizer on the other side of the blade is likely going to be smaller in diameter (If not, I don't see how these stabilizers would serve much purpose, anyway!).

When I began to install the expected two stabilizer configuration, I had an 'uh-duh' moment, in which I realized that installation of the inside stabilizer shifts the center-point of the blade! Seemed pretty obvious a little later than I'd have hoped! This means that you will have to reposition your splitter, as well as replace any zero-clearance inserts you use, and in my case, may not be able to use your stock insert. In my case (a Jet JWTS-10), I had to shim all of the mount points for the splitter with matching washers, as the adjustment slots at these points were not wide enough to compensate for the stabilizer. Adding the washers and lining the splitter up with the newly positioned blade was an intricate affair.

There is also a small element of danger added when using these stabilizers, in that when bringing the blade up while spinning, which is called for, once in a while, the stabilizers can lift the insert, which would, of course, send it flying like a missile. Similarly, make certain that the added height obtained by the higher stabilizer when angling the blade does not bring it in contact with the insert; in some instances, the blade may have to be lowered when angling it, so that this will not occur. I believe there are adjustable stops inside the saw cabinet that can limit movement. At my next free chance, I will be looking to make such an adjustment to limit the risk, at least for the upper limit on the blade height.

I haven't yet determined whether the stabilizers affect the runout of the blade. I will look into this soon. Now that I've committed to using the stabilizers, I think this would be the only negative side effect that would prompt me to remove them. All the same, I'm not sure I would have started on this path if I could start again!",3.0
"Tried to put both of the stabilizers on my 10"" table saw and the blade rubs on the insert plate.

"This is a sharp blade that cuts fair for the price, but there is a fair amount of wobble to it. I'm a hobby woodworker and I'm always looking to find a deal on a throw-away saw blade. At the time, I was able to get this blade for under $17. I haven't hated this blade, especially at that price, but the quality of this blade is not high enough (in my opinion) for a lot of applications. Ripcuts and chamfers leave LOTS of chatter marks. When I use my zero clearance insert with this blade, it's terribly loud from all of the wobbling of the blade against the insert.
I realize I'm using a ""construction"" blade in a woodworking application, but to me, for the money, I'd spend $10 more and buy a Diablo. My diablo blade has outperformed my dewalt, hitachi, and even my Forrest WWII in terms of stability and longevity.
All that being said, if I wanted a sharp blade to throw in my miter saw and cross cut some 2x4's, this blade would do a fine job of it, it would be much cheaper than many of the other name brand saw blades out there, and it would last longer than many of the throw-away blades out there.",3.0

Anyhow, use a rust removing spray like Rust Free, and spritz both sides of the individual shims.

The chuck is cheesy (sorry) the cord seems borrowed from a cheap TV, the direction switch feels like it's gonna break each time I use it. Maybe the Milwaukee 3/8 I remember using a while back was an older model. I am sure the essential guts and geabox in this unit are still bulletproof, but the daily details have been neglected and it was this I noticed immediately and unrelentingly. So for another $30 or so I can buy a proper cord and a nice Jacobs chuck and have.. what?",3.0
"A former Dewalt owner. The Milwaukee 3/8 is good drill. I'm going to ding it because after a short time using a grinder attachment to remove rust, the front metal housing gets HOT. The drill appears to be well built. Ready to take my abuse. Small normal drilling jobs will be no problem. But like I say, my drill usually take some serious abuse.",3.0
"I was looking for a good worm drive saw made in the USA for our shop. I called  Amazon and was assured that it was and ordered it. Then I went on vacation. When i returned the saw had already been used several times and right there on the label - Made In China.... of course!

Amazon page for this product says both ""Origin: USA"" and ""Certifications: UL, CSA Assembled In: USA""

This is probably going to be a decent saw and I was hard-pressed to even find one that was mislabeled as Made in USA.

Please try to buy American Made products when you can!",3.0
"I bought this saw figuring it would be the last made in the USA Skilsaw I would buy.  The specifications on Amazon list the origin as USA and the description states assembled in the USA.  Well the package says assembled in China, with the blade from USA, China or Japan.  I'll keep the saw but i""m seriously bummed.",3.0
"I ordered this 8 1/4 skil worm drive saw with the intent of being able to cut through two 2x stock in one pass. But, it comes up short by an 1/8"". The annoying part is as advertised, will cut 3"" at 90 degrees. What they meant to say was 2 7/8"" at 90 degrees. Now I have a $200 saw that will last for 50 years that doesn't do what it was advertised to do. Did anyone at Black and Decker think to make the blades 8 1/2""? There's room. I will probably get the Big Foot attachment now to compensate for my small saw.",3.0
"The hold down rod did not fit into the fence. It seems like the hole was never milled out after casting. Otherwise everything is solidly made, heavy castings all on parts. Chisels seem sharp enough but I doubt they would have lasted very long in dense woods.

I wanted to like this very much but it just simply did not work for me. The amount of effort involved in getting this on (requires I remove the depth gauge/stop from the press before clamping on the chisel holder) negated the benefits. If I required production quantities of mortises to be made then I can see how the lengthy setup would be worth it, but if I were a production shop I would just invest in a real mortiser.",3.0
Had to do just the opposite written in the instructions to get the daylight savings feature to work.,3.0
"I've had the Jet for about a year. It's basically a good saw--plenty of power for most operations, and the blade has stayed in alignment.  However, you'll find that fence (specifically, the JETFence) is inadequate--it's easy to knock out of alignment when you're running large panels. If you buy this one, you'll be looking for a replacement fence (at a cost of $200 - $400) pretty quickly. Jet's XActa fence is much better, but of course will cost you more.  You could also look at buying a Powermatic or the latest Dewalt--both are as good or better, both have better fences, and they don't cost that much more.",3.0
"Bought one of these about 8 years ago after having had excellent experiences with American-made Delta products (eg, Unisaw, shaper, etc.)
I was a bit disappointed with this tool.  It was difficult to assemble  & the instructions were virtually incomprehensible---had to give up on  them and just use common sense/knowledge to get it together.  Fit and  finish is quite rough in comparison to US made tools----some  filing/deburring/minor machining was required to get everything to work  smoothly.
Runout was a bit more than I had hoped for, but was within the  tolerances I need for woodworking. For more precise tolerances needed in  metal working--no way.
The tool works okay, but for those into tool  aesthetics (as am I) it comes up short.",3.0
"Got this item and it had parts missing and had sawdust in the case. The parts that were there were louse and scattered. It had obviously been opened, used and returned. So sent it back to Amazon who were great with replacing it right away.

Got the second one and it was in in better shape but as has become the case with Delta nowdays the manual for it had a lot to be desired. Regardless I knew how to set it up but found that is didn't quite fit my quill on the drill press. Which could be understandable if it was some weird off brand. But my Drill Press is a pretty new Delta machine. So the Delta Mortising attachment didn't even fit a Delta Drill press. Jeez. Anyway I got it up and running but the bit doesn't seat as far up in the chuck as it should and when it runs it rubs slightly on the chisel. On top of that the Mortises are pretty sloppy and I've cut better ones using a standard drill bit and a sharp chisel in about the same amount of time with out the time killing set up.",3.0
I have used mortising tools for sometime and will get many years of use from this one. I am writing because the tool came with the housing nut completely stripped out. I am not really concerned because it is easily replaced and for the price I am happy to change it out. However the novice might want to ensure the product is completely serviceable before purchasing.,3.0
"The attachment was bought to mount on a Delta Model 17=950L.  The chisel holder fit ok but was a little tight fitting.  With a wedge to increase the
diameter it finally went on.
The Fence was a different story.  The T-nuts are too big for the table slots and the Fence is too short to span the distance between the slots by about 2 inches.
By mounting the fence in reverse and using the accessory slots the fence was secured.  A 2X4 was required to set the spacing and larger clamps were required to hold the materiel.
After the modification the mortising went well.",3.0
"Perfect, been using for ever, the best!",3.0
Good blades in a lousy paper package.  These types of cutting tools should come in a snap case instead of a paper package.,3.0
Well made but did not fit my drill press.,3.0
"Not sure it was all the original kit, but it was useable and complete",3.0
"I'm giving this blade 3 stars.  on a 0-10 scale  7 for accuracy of cut.. 8 for durability and bend resistance.  I use a bostich 3 inch blade from walmart that is less $$, and it out performs in every way.  I am still a fan of Bosch and their products, just wasn't very impressed with this blade, nothing special here!",3.0
"This blade is over priced, and while it cuts wood quite well, be careful not to hit any nails or other hard material such as concrete as this will wipe your blade out.  One would think that for the price paid for this blade, it would be carbide tipped, but it is only made from high speed steel.  I like the hint from another reviewer that used his dremel tool with a cutoff wheel to re-grind teeth in the blade to get a little more life out of the blade.  While it does not work quite as well as the original new blade, it does work marginally well -- which saves you money.  Maybe Fein will someday get a clue, and make a quality blade, or charge a more reasonable price for the inferior quality blade they produce.",3.0
"I purchased this refurbished tool for an unorthodox application:  Permanently mounted upside down, it cuts biscuit slots for drawer boxes in my professional one-person shop.

I have owned DeWalt (good; rack and pinion), Porter Cable 555 (a profound failure in design), an earlier model Freud (very good for the $) and currently use a Lamello for all my handheld work.

Out of the box, the fence would not lock parallel to the blade.  This is absolutely crucial in a BJ, because any error in parallelism is doubled on account of the way the mating slots are cut.  I had to fashion a cotter pin-shaped shim .025"" to put in one side of the fence-to-backplate joint.  It still took testing to get it to stay straight, and that was not easily repeatable.  Unless you use this tool at only one setting, and are willing to futz patiently to get it right, it will not be a practical device to have around.

The DeWalt handle section of the body is better designed than the Freud's.  When I grasp this one to use it handheld, the part of the base that comes back hits my fingers.

That said, there is ample power, the base slides nicely and is pretty snug. I would never buy one of the Harbor Fright imports, but I expected at this price point to get something a little closer to practical in terms of occasional use.  I am convinced that an amateur would become so frustrated with this tool that, after using a few biscuits, the rest would be used to make fire starters with the Cub Scouts and the tool would gather dust in a bottom drawer.",3.0
"The biscuit joiner is a good value when you compare it to models from the other manufacturers. If you are looking for a well made tool with attention to detail then this unit is not for you. The castings for the face plate are rough and unfinished with the fit and finish leaving a lot to be desired. I was able to diassemble my fence and file off some of the rough edges so that it would be more pleasant to use. There are no useable issues with the joiner and it does what you want it to do; but pretty it ain't.

I like the carrying case and the supplies that come with it (biscuits etc.) but I was expecting a little better on the finishing side. The alignment marks on the fence are nice although should be longer. The measuring gauge down the side of the fence is not exact (doesn't line up properly) but the hope is that if you don't touch it between uses for the same cut then the should align regardless.

A good, functional tool for the price.",3.0
"I bought this to upgrade from a Ryobi unit which was functional enough but which has a pretty crude fence arrangment.  I'd fairly recently bought a Freud router which compared favorably with my Porter Cable units so I tried this. The machine is an upgrade but it's got its annoying issues.  The motor's fine, the balance is good, the fence is pretty good as well although the lock on both the height and angle adjustments are easily knocked out of position unless they are very tight.  Things that are a little troublesome are the easily plugged chip chute, the sawdust catch bag which does not stay on the machine - falls off immediately.  The size of the chip chute connection doesn't fit any standard hoses I've got.  The switch on the motor can best be described as funky requiring a sliding and rocking motion.  The price is a plus the accuracy is more than adequate.  Just some rough edges.  Would spring for the PC next time but this thing does the job so I am not likely to replace it any time soon.",3.0
It is better than a kick in the shins and seems to work fairly well after I worked on the fit between the main casting and the lower stop on the quill of my drill press.  My measurement was 66 mm but their casting had a lot of paint on it.  I used a rotary sanding unit in the drill press to remove paint but also had to remove a slight amount of metal.  After applying a little silicone it now fits fine.,3.0
"Tightening lever's groves stripped out on first use; metal of the lever itself is too soft do do the job. Otherwise, the tool did what it was designed to do.",3.0
"but it shears off it's teeth too rapidly and becomes a jagged wiggling wobbly weirdo tool that disappoints.
They meant well but didn't deliver in tool steel-strength department and maybe that's why they give a 3-blade pack cause you're going to need lots of these suckers to finish the task. They don't like to strike even the smallest nails and this needs to be corrected as the Fein tool is specifically designed for blind incision work and will ultimately strike buried objects of varying  hardness.
  Keep trying guys...........I'll be patient.",3.0
"while functional and relatively easy to set up i found the quality poor.  The face you clamp your work to looks like it was finsihed with a angle grinder leaving a surface with ridges that will damage any finished surface clamped to it.  The hold down clamp is poorly designed and is unusable for any tall stock.  Essentially it is cheaply made, but with modification, time, and effort you can make a functional mortiser out of a good drill press.",3.0
"Good tool very sharp so be careful. You need a good drill press for this tool to work properly. Instructions were ok, quality was as expected for the price. Not a top end tool,but did a good job for my first project. Now i need to upgrade to a better drill press. You will need to learn how to sharpen these chisels.",3.0
I too made the mistake of buying this tool. The annoying noise and the dust collection system I can live with but the slipping fence is totally unacceptable.  I did do a quick fix to the fence which worked and the rating jumped from a 1 star to 3.  I just drilled and tapped two holes on the face of the fence opposite the existing tightening lever and put in a set screw in each and now no slippage.  One hole probably would have worked just fine but the aluminum fence is soft and doing two holes was no problem so what the heck.,3.0
"This biscuit joiner has a lot going for it. Inexpensive price tag, nice blade, fairly stable base for biscuit jointing smaller stock (NOT requiring the adjustable fence). Even with those nice features, this tool causes a LOT of aggravation. The most irritating thing about this tool is the fence! It uses a single screw on the side to create enough pressure to hold the adjustable fence in place. There is a flaw to this simple system -- IT DOESN'T WORK. If you are able to achieve a square fence adjustment and you have just about stripped the screw to get the fence to stay in place; after 2 biscuit slots being cut, it will start slipping on you. It doesn't take much pressure at all to get it to slip, either. The other irritating feature about this biscuit joiner is the sound the motor makes. I would spring for the Porter Cable or DeWalt joiners.",3.0
"I purchased the JS102 few years ago and the others cost about 50% more at the time but with more features. First there was no oil in the oiler - the plastic cap cracked and I had oil all over inside the plastic case. The plastic case is blow mold and never closed right, like my cheap Chinese tool cases. Initially the I thought the cutting blade was missed aligned or too wide since the biscuits fit very loose in the slots even with plenty of glue in it, but now, after a few years, its ok, nice and tight with the same box of 1,000 biscuits I purchased elsewhere. The stick-on angle scale came off but the factory gave me a new one - never needed it anyway, all my cuts are at 90 degrees. If you have different thickness boards, the height adjustment on the fence could be a PIA since there are no fine adjustments like the other biscuit cutters. You need to make a few test cuts to make sure the slot is in the middle of the board or where you wanted it - I don't trust the scale. I have no problems with the dust bag, just empty it every 10 cuts - yes, lots chips form those slots.

Now the most erratic part: the motor/gear box sounds like it has a bunch of loose parts inside, sounds like they forgot to grease the gear box at the factory or it has broken teeth in gear box. Sounds worse than my Craftman 4.5"" grinder. Other than that it feels solid and it does cut well after its set up. If only they would put in one dollar more for a better case, two dollars more for a fine adjustment and a little better quality control.",3.0
"I go thru a lot these blades..you just cannot beat the prices that I can find on Amazon for these blade, on my last order I placed it was for three 2 1/2"" ""Precision"" E cut when they arrived the package had two Precision and one ""regular"" it didn't bother me because I used it the next day and it performed just as well as the more expensive type blades, plus what I was working on did not demand that clean or precise of a cut, so next time I will purchase both types for my indispensible Fein tool?

"These are great for cutting softer woods and plywood. Don't use them on hard woods like maple because the teeth will deteriorate quickly. If you need to cut hardwoods use the 1"" wide blades, they are much better. Fein makes good products but they must think that we are all rich like they must be. Their prices are way too high. Soon there will be others that will interchange and the prices will come down. In the meantime we will keep making them rich.",3.0
"I recently bought this drill attachment; it works well except for the cheap chisels. It came with four units. Three fit the holder very well, but one was too tight. I ended up ruining the chisel trying to get it back out of the holder.",3.0
"The noise is aweful. There's something to be said by doing things silently with fine handtools. Then there's doing things with good power tools and smooth running motors. Then there's my sons push mower that ejects plastic balls within plastic that clicks and clatters. This motor is maybe more annoying than a plastic mower.
It does the basic job, it's cheap. If you're not doing many joints or are sticking to the basics it's fine maybe give it another star for limited use. Or get a 557 for twice as much, do more, and not be annoyed by that aweful motor.",3.0
"I bought this tool then returned it because I found it time-consuming to set up and use. Still, it's quite a bit cheaper than the Porter Cable 557 (which I would recommend), and once you get it all adjusted (and assuming you don't need to change the setup much) it does work reasonably well for the money.
The manual is plain awful. Pictures are so low-res that I can't make sense of them. Instructions on using the unit are incomplete.
The tool arrived in need of readjustment. Since I've never used bisquits before, it took me a long time to figure out how it should work properly, then I was able to get it to adjust... just barely: the adjustment screw was nearly at the end of its range when I got the depth adequately set. The manual says that this adjustment should be set properly when the tools is new. I agree! It wasn't, though.
The tool can't do many of the things that the PC557 can do. The fence in particular is not very flexible. On the other hand I expect that 45 and 90 are most of what I'll use, and this tool does those ok.
...",3.0
"Porter cable isn't what it used to be.  My circa 1996 is the older model.  I bought a second one because I am doing more jig work and don't want to mess up my settings when switching between bits in my jig.  The plastic is cheaper/softer.  This mentality runs through a lot of their sanders too.  I have an older 4x24 Belt sander, and it is heavier, better switch, better plastic than the new ones I saw in the store where the stupid orange people are that will remain nameless.  I am buying an extra base for my old router because the D-handle is much easier to grab and hold than the simple two-ball option that they also have.  After swinging a hammer for a very long time I don't mind admitting that clamping down on the old  ball style handles is getting harder to do without cramping up my fingers.",3.0
"This setup is okay for limited use.  One disappointment was the poor shape the cutting surfaces are in....I am a big fan of SHARP....these are not really too well conditioned.  But, for the limited use I plan of using this tool for, it appears as though it will perform well enough to allow me to get small projects completed.  I suggest you visit a bit sharpener or get to work with your own stones prior to beginning any work.",3.0
"Received the product and put it together in about an hour.  Agree with previous reviews that alignment is going to be an issue and without proper alignment it's useless.  My big problem was that I bought the product for a particular project (a large workbench) and the piece does not fit on the drill press (4x4 column).  Both height and depth were issues.  I tested on scrap wood and it seems to cut nice square holes, however, I'm going to have to go the old fashioned route for this project.  Looks like it will be good for small projects.",3.0
"I am limited on funds and space, so I thought this drill press mortising attachment would be great.  It's not bad.  First, I like the ease of assembly--just follow the easy to read directions, and ten minutes later you're ready to go.  Set up and adjustment is also a snap.  The problem lies, however, in the quality of the chisels.  I was cutting one inch deep mortises in hard maple.  I started to get tear out after the first five or six.  So, I'd sharpen the chisels (using a diamond cone purchased from Rockler) again and again.  My mortiing chisels hold an edge much longer.

The fence is a bit smaller than the fence on stand-alone mortisers, but since I mainly use it for small items, it hasn't become an issue.

Nevertheless, the system is easy to use and truth be told, so is sharpening.  For the price, I would purchase it again.  Perhaps as time passes, I will upgrade the chisels.",3.0
"The Austrian bits are very brittle as well as expensive.  Go with these cheap chisel/bit sets and you're much better off. I've gotten several hundred holes with the ""cheap asian"" bits and only a dozen or so with the ""fine Austrian"" bits.",3.0
"I have just circular-filed my third and final D-Handle base for the 691 Series Porter Cable router line. After 15 years of use, the motor body has unfortunately been damaged by the warping bases as well, not to mention the wear on the adjusting pins. While I understand that the 691 is the standard for basic routing, the 691 accessories I have purchased over the years make it that much harder to shop for something new. It is a good investment for a first router, but if you are looking for a serious tool that you can hand down to a son or grandson, try something else.",3.0
"I bought this tool with my drill press a couple years ago and have hardly used it.  There is nothing wrong with it, but I find that there are several things that stop me from using it more often.  The first is the setup.  It takes too long and is too awkward.  Personally I'd rather pop in a forstener bit into my drill press and make several passes to achieve a very good mortise - although this doesn't work if you are doing a through mortise.
PROS:
* Does the job it states
* Much cheaper than a dedicated mortiser
CONS:
* Much too time consuming to set up
* Has a very hard time cutting through hardwoods
* Chisels seem to dull quickly",3.0
"The spacers that come with the unit makes it a ""one size fits all"" tool.  The spacers that come with the unit did not fit my Delta Radial Drill Press.  I took the unit to local VoEd School and their machine shop class made me a shim that fits. After that, the unit seems to work fine.  I am only a hobby wood worker and it should be acceptable.  It clearly is not a production type tool, however, for the price I consider it a good deal.",3.0
The blade works great for most applications except in very hard woods where it's life expectancy is greatly reduced. Still a wonderfully useful tool.,3.0
"Almost $40, including shipping, for a little bitty blade. That is about the same as for a 10"" 40 tooth carbide tipped table saw blade. The Fein flush cut blade is a lifesaver for certain tasks, like undercutting door jambs when installing laminate flooring, but being severely price-gouged sure takes the fun out of a great tool. Hopefully someone will clone these and sell them for $10, and still make a decent profit.",3.0
"THIS BLADE IS VERY HANDY FOR FLUSH CUTTING IN SOFT TO SEMISOFT WOOD. DON'T EXPECT BLADE TO LAST VERY LONG.  WILL CUT HARD WOOD, BUT WEARS OUT VERY FAST.  NO LONGER THAN BLADE LAST WITH USE IT'S VERY PRICY.",3.0
"The Multi Master is a great time saving tool. The convex cutting attachment works great at cutting carpet with a wood floor below, if the floor is cement the blade dulls too fast to be of much use",3.0
"This blade is pretty weak and doesn't seem to compare to the original Fein blade that came with my multimaster.  I tried using it at different oscillating speeds but ended up having it overheat and warp.  Maybe its me that is using it wrong but can tell you I had no warping on the original blade.  Since the price has come way down, perhaps its a cheaper blade than before or the price now matches the performance.  I was able to finish making my cuts but probably won't use this again.",3.0
"Doesn't work as well as the metal/wood e-cut blade that came included with my Fein tool. I've tried this blade for cutting hardwoods - teak and mahogeny so far of about 7/8"" thickness by 1"" - and the blade didn't cut wood well. It was much slower going than the metal/wood blade, and the 2nd time it started burning the wood. I wasn't using too much pressure or going too fast, it just heated up a lot, which the metal/wood e-cut blade hasn't done.

So far this was a waste of money. Maybe it's only useful for soft woods?",3.0
"Sadly, I found the same insert at Sears for half the price and better made. The leveling screws on this insert are phillips, but the Sears product uses allen screws which are better. Otherwise, both inserts are identical.",3.0
"Well, this does work and it fits exactly right.  But, be very careful when cutting small parts with a thin dado blade because the workpiece can fall below the insert.

In other words, if you are cutting a 1/4"" dado there is a lot of open area where stuff can fall. If you are cutting thin dados, your workpiece should be at least three inches wide, and that still is not very stable.

If you use a your dado blades a lot, I recommend that you create inserts (using zero clearance inserts) for dados between 1/4"" and 5/8"".  I've got two inserts--3/8"" and 5/8"". The danger of parts falling below the insert is just too high.

And geez, this seems expensive.  Zero clearance inserts are about $22 and I think they work better.",3.0

"Having owned a Makita Chop Saw for approx. 15 yrs. I'm impressed with it's reliability. Now it's time to replace it.....One bit of info. that is needed is H/P not amps. Horse power can give the buyer an idea of the power available/how tough a cutting job may be attempted.  I have tried the DeWalt 871 - 5.3 HP and found it unreliable. I have experienced multiple armature failures and while DeWalt cheerfully fixed it under warrantee, it does not have the reliability a tool of this class should have. Note: While DeWalt has not admitted to me that there is a defect in their armature design, one of their distributors finally revealed to me that they stopped handling this model for just that reason. Too bad for initially it appeared to be a great chop saw!  With the experience that I've had with Makita, (it always seemed tough and ready to go until age caught up with it) I would buy another if they offered a model with competative HP (4 to 5.3 HP) and price w/o even shopping the market. As for now, I'm still shopping.",3.0
"The metal blade chop saws such as DeWalt's sell for 2x to 2.5x the price of this one.  However, they work better, and the blade is much more reliable.  This was a bad idea from the outset...soft cutting wheels.  I  argue they are too quick to fail, possibly even dangerous when they do.  This is a saw for light aluminum work or for steel studs for drywall or  maybe electrical conduit.  Any of those applications would be better served  by an investment in a metal blade tool.",3.0

If you're on the fence about getting one of these and getting a dry-cut chop saw I'd say spend the extra money and get the dry-cut (metal blade) saw. I got one of these: Makita LC1230 12-Inch Metal Cutting Saw and it's %100 better.",3.0

"I have been through a bunch of these blades because they are cheap to buy. The blade is very thin, which is good for cutting drywall and paneling holes and such. The problem occurs when you need to cut any type of wood that isn't super thin. The blade gets HOT when cutting wood. The Blade is very thin. Guess what happens to an extremely hot and thin peice of metal? It warps. I have a collection of these blades with good teeth still on them that are warped like crazy.

I understand that cutting with these multi-tools is a balance between speed and pressure. You don't want to go to fast or push to hard because that will create heat and chew through teeth, but you also don't want to cut too slow because that can also generate unwanted heat on the blade warping it and ruining the teeth. You don't want to push so hard you here the motor on your unit start to slow its pitch.",3.0
"I believe this dewalt circular saw is a fine product. I had to file the piece of the metal frame that contacts the metal base so that I could adjust

the blade square with the base. the problem that I still have is that the left side of the base is straight but the right side is distorted (caused when they stamped the hole in the base for the blade). this will not work if I want the saw to follow a guide for cutting sheet goods. The saw has all the nessary adjustment points. I really shouldn't have to modify

I have an old Freuds 200 series set I bought years ago for under a $100 that came packaged in a case that is surprisingly far superior to the case they packaged the SD508 set.

My tool is a Bosch which I love, the Bosch brand blades are pricey, like the Fein use to be.  There is a reason.  The blades are stamped from one sheet where some of the other blades have the cutting blade (which is flat) attached to a heavier ring which then mounts to the tool.  (This is the Bosch design.)

I have yet to find and adapter that works well either so the universal adapter just pinches onto the metal with the hope friction will keep it from moving.  Thinking I was doing something wrong (and it still feels this way!) I checked around on several woodworking forums and found many others were having the same problem.

For a little over $5 per blade, it's worth three stars.  If I paid over $30 like some, I would be screaming, and then buying the Bosch blades.",3.0

Used it to cut the bottom of fir/pine door frames when installing laminate flooring.  Didn't last as long as expected - a few door frames.  Not much kerf so makes a nice skinny cut but seems to be soft steel so wears out pretty fast.  Too expensive for how long it lasts.,3.0

"This saw will cut. We have 5 of them. We cut 3/8"" aluminum plate with no problem and have yet to burn one out or break a gear box in 2 years.

 The draw backs are we have to keep a stock of the arms for the blade guard. They are plastic a keep breaking. If the saw is dropped the cast aluminum arms that hold the base on can break. To fix it the whole gear box housing has to be replaced.",3.0
"If you've ever used a B&D Super Sawcat-either 7 1/4"" or 8 1/4""-you'll understand my point of view. The Sawcat is the saw to which I judge all others. The first and most obvious comparison is the DeWalt's electric brake-the blade still turns after the saw is shut down. When you shut down a Sawcat the blade stops, and I mean now. The next item is the shoe plate. The DeWalt is wide enough, but if you look at a Sawcat's shoe plate you notice B&D turned up the edges just a skosh so when you run it down a straight edge it won't hang up in that invariable gap between the straight edge and the item you're cutting. No turned up edge on the DeWalt. In addition on the DeWalt's shoe plate where there are the marks indicating the blade path at 45 and and 0 degrees there is a bit of residual casting that makes the 0 degree line indistinct. I suppose a slight high speed modification with a file will cure the problem, but a Sawcat wouldn't require any file work. These, of course, are details, but, hey, that's what carpentry is all about. On the plus side are all the items mentioned by other reviewers-good long cord, easy depth adjustment (although the indicator on the depth gauge sits far enough away from the gauge to make exact reading questionable), external brushes, good balance, and power. Whether or not the DeWalt can stand up to years of gaff like a Sawcat, I can't say. In sum, the DeWalt is a decent saw for the price, but guys like me will keep looking for that stash of new old stock Sawcats.",3.0

"Dial-a-width.....Great concept but I was a little disappointed in a couple areas.
1. It comes standard for a right tilting saw.  Surprising these days with the popularity of left tilting saws.  Anyhow should have been easy job to change over as per instructions, but one of the three screws that had to be removed just would not budge.  Ending up stripping the head.  Had no choice but to drill out and replace the screw with another 4M C/S head.  Anyhow no biggy issue just annoying.  Freud where quick to offer to send out the screws but no need as I found some locally.
2.  With the stack mounted in the saw you need the supplied box spanner to be able to access the arbor bolt nut.  This is fine except that spanner did not fit my arbor nut.  Had to grind the nut down to fit.
3.  The cut although crisp did not leave a flat bottom, but with slight ridges.
These are not deal breakers.  The dial a width makes up for it.

"I received my Freud Super Dado blade set and had the need to use it right away.  The blades worked just fine.  I was able to stack the whole set on my Delta Contractor's saw but the outer shim had to be left off as per the saw instructions.  Nice smooth and sharp cuts, sure beats multiple passes with the single blade I was doing.  As others have mentioned the case is a flimsy light weight plastic outer case with an unsure snap latch, I carry it from underneath and not by the handle since it seems like it will come undone easily.  The inside cushioning is blow molded plastic film and will easily be cut by the blades.  For this investment I expected more than a $1.25 case.  I do not expect the case to last as long - I plan on having to build a good wooden case for this blade set.  You will not be disappointed in the blade set - just the carrying case.",3.0

It works fine for most work.  It does not leave a perfectly smooth bottom to the channel that is cut.  The blades are not perfectly matched but it does fine for creating lap joints and dado cuts where the pieces are to be glued together.  I would not use it to make dental molding like is shown in the accompanying video.,3.0
I was recently cutting some PVC pipe and after cutting the first piece with no problem when I started to cut the second piece the blade shattered. I've only used the blade 2 or 3 times when I did some home improvement projects a year ago. It is an expensive blade to replace but I love the tool. But I guess their patent has run out because now the same type of tool is available at a way lower price from Sears and Dremel and some other manufacturers. The question will be whether or not the quality will be the same. However for the average DIYer they will probably do the job. I sent an email to Fein expressing my dissatisfaction with the blade but I doubt I will get any response. I'll wait to buy another blade until I actually need it.,3.0
Same as all blades you get for this tool.  Too short of lifespan for the money.,3.0

Interesting application--I repaired old brick foundation that had very thin, rotten mortar.  I used a worn out wood blade between the bricks, the old mortar just fell out.  Totally ruined the blade, but I sailed through the mortar like butter and most of the debris fell out, so clean up was a couple of quick blasts of air and I was ready to tuckpoint.
I would recomend the tool a lot quicker if the blades were reasonable, but tool not a good choice because of operating cost.",3.0

"I had great expectations from this dado set and put out the extra bucks for it.  So far I'm disappointed and considering trying to sell it.  Didn't really get to test it in time to return it through Amazon and still need to try all the chippers.

I have done approximately 200 dado cuts which need to be very precise and in a situation where the bottom of the cut will show dramatically.  So far, the bottoms of the cuts are not flat and square.  The cuts seem only marginally better than my old Craftsman ""wobbler"" quickset dado blade.  The left end cutter seems to go deeper and at a slight angle, and there is slight variation in the depth of the chippers.  When crosscutting in hardwood, the bottom of the cut looks torn out rather than smoothly cut out.  Width of the cut seems to vary in that what was a tight friction fit with one setup is a slightly sloppy fit with the next exact same setup.  It requires extreme care when aligning the blades so the teeth don't touch, specially when tightening the blade stack on the arbor.

In a premium dado set, it is hard to believe that the chipper blades and shims are not labeled or marked for thickness.  You can measure and take a guess at the chipper blade widths--it is somewhat obvious, but you need to use a micrometer to measure the shims and then mark them yourself.  How much trouble and expense could it be for Freud to do this?

The outside blades are nicely chrome plated, but on my set, the extensive printing on one of these blades was half missing and smeared.  So much for aesthetics.

With any dado set, a case is very important to prevent damage to the carbide tips.  The supplied case is more appropriate for packaging a toy and not a heavy set of expensive blades.  The case is plastic with foam inserts, but the blades are isolated and held in place mainly by a thin vacuformed piece of plastic, thinner and more brittle than most of the ""hard to open"" packaging we usually get these days.  With normal shipping, this cracks, breaks, and the blade tips shred it into powder.  My set arrived with red plastic dust and cracked, shredded plastic.  The thin vacuformed plastic spacers used to keep the blades off of each other are easily crushed, won't last long, and are size critical (different sized spacers for outside cutters and chippers).  Even if you don't move this dado set around much, it appears that the interior of the case won't last long.

I bought this set on recommendation of a 2005 review in Fine Woodworking which favored it generally over 14 others.  Looks like quality control has suffered in the interim and makes me wonder where all the parts are actually manufactured now.",3.0
"The blade did a good job for the narrower cuts that I executed.  The problem was that my contractor saw has the ability to cut 13/16"" & 3/4"" dados, but the DIAL on the Freud dado set up blade makes all but the narrowest cuts (1/2"" & 3/8"" or less) the only ones you can cut.  The space taken up by (1) the Freud  'Dial' and (2) the arbor nut  don't give you enough room to close the arbor nut more than one thread on the arbor nut to secure the Dado blade set up...getting way TOO tight for dado operation.  My saw (Ridgid) did not have another washer on the other side of the blade which possibly could have been eliminated (like in the Bosch 4100 Contractor Saw)..I needed to cut 3/4""  dados so I simply had to execute the cut with several passes.  Its too expensive for this type of restriction.",3.0
"Just bought the 6"" stacked dado set, and have been not pleased with the unevenness of the bottom of the slot cut. Even in my zero-clearance throat plate, the slot cut is uneven - the blades apparently aren't stacking true to yield a flat bottom to the slot. Oversized holes for the arbor???? I will be further experimenting to see if this can be remedied. Other than than, the set appears to be well-made, and the shims allow exactly matching the slot to get a tight fit to the mating lumber. The carry box is handy - but the quality of the plastic used for the box is questionable, and I wonder how long the box will last before cracking and disintegrating.",3.0
"I have this set in the 6""  size,  and the less expensive 8"" in the professional series.  While the 6"" does seem to hold  ""slightly"" tighter tolerances  IT DOES NOT MAKE SMOOTHER BOTTOMS  than the 8""  set  AND  the tolerances are so tight on the shaft that sometimes it takes up to 30 mins. and lots of cussin, to get multiple  chippers off the motor shaft.

The exchange process with Amazon was seamless and the second one had none of the issues the first one did.  In addition it cuts beatiful dadoes - flat bottomed with almost no tearout.",3.0
I agree with a previous comment.  It was a disappointment to find out that my Rigid saw would not handle the dado set for larger than 1/2 cuts.  For shallow width cuts it was o.k. after lengthy set up process.  I feel like Freud could have explained the risks of not working on a lot of saws a little more up front.  Wrench would not fit arbor nut.,3.0
"I have used this saw on a limited number of occasions. It is a decent and accurate saw. BUT if you want to get more than your moneys worth look to this saws bigger brother the C10F. If you're seriously considering spending  the coin that this machine costs, you have to ask yourself. How much better  is this saw than the DeWalt 705? True, it can cut slightly wider moldings,  although they have to lay down (as with all slide compounds) It only bevels  to one side, same as the DW705.  What about really large crown moldings?  The real advantage of the C10F over the C8f is the ability to bevel left  AND right. With its larger 10"" blade, belt drive and double bevel  ability  the $100 more that it costs over the C8F is money VERY well spent.  Because when you're cutting 8"" or 10"" crown molding the last  thing you want to do is to flip around a 16' board AND make three saw  adjustments to make a miter return on the other end. You can also cut  finish stair stringers with this saw. It miters to 52 degrees!  P.S.  Buy an extra hold down clamp too.  (Tool Crib #307559) Moving the 1 clamp  from left to right all the time is a hassle.",3.0
"Unfortunately I had to return it as it did not work with the Ridgid T2424 tablesaw. The arbor bolt is too short and housing interferes with 3 small bolts on the outside dado blade (opposite of dial blade).

Also, the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it, like the Dewalt.

Yes the parts fit. Disassembly and reassembly are straight forward. Would have helped to have a friend in order to help hold and balance the upper wheel while tryig to install the retaining bolt. But they did a poor job relocating the power switch. It would no merely bolt back on as it had originally. The holes in the rizer were not located properly. I could have drilled through the switch mounting bracket and used 1 screw to secure it. I chose to add 1/4 ply to the original holes, and mount switch to that.",3.0
"I chose this dado set based on the top reviews, and I am somewhat disappointed in the product. A substantial number of the carbide tips on both the outside blades and the chippers have imperfections and chips. The brazing is not as uniform as other saw blades I own. Some of the chippers were a little rusty. The cuts are decent, though the points of the ATB outer blades leave a fine but slightly deeper groove than the chippers at the extreme edge of the dado. Additionally, the chippers cut about 1/100 of an inch shallower than the outer blades, so I have to clean up every single cut when making a box joint.",3.0
"Surrounded by glowing reviews, I hate to be the only dissenter. My set has been very dissapointing. On my Sears contractor saw each blade cuts at a distenctly different level. The resulting groove or dado can look positivly sawtooth. Are there problems with fit on Sears saws???  This is dispite considerable shiming and jiggling, and yes, I sequence them in the prescribed order (and have tried varying the order, also.)

"Just installed this today but could not get blade to track in the middle of bottom wheel. Using a straightedge I determined that the top wheel was not aligned with the bottom one. This was a new saw so had never used it without the riser block. I removed the riser block and reassembled the saw, tensioned the blade, and the blade tracked right in the center of the bottom wheel so it appears that the riser block has the alignment holes or pins in the wrong place. Amazon has already responded with a ship date and I expect to have the replacement block in a couple of days. Amazon gets an A for handling this promptly. I will post again once I install the new riser.

"I cut a dado of 1/4"" with the two blades. I turns out it's a bit narrow and I actually needed to use that 0.02"" shim to get it at 1/4"" (it might be 0.2""). Is this a normal thing for dado blades and I should expect to be adjusting this or did I get a faulty one? I sent an email to Freud but it's been about a month with no reply. I thought the reviews would say something about this if it's an issue but no one said anything about the accuracy of the cuts. I would like some input as well.  Thanks.",3.0
"The Pro Dado set seems well-constructed, but the factory apparently enclosed two blades of the same orientation.  In other words, the beveled teeth of both main blades face the same direction, so that when they are mounted, the resulting cut is too wide by about 1/16 inch.  I am in contact with Freud to see what they will do.  Otherwise the set is robust and should suffice for a 10-tooth dado.  More later",3.0
"The Makita Plate Joiner is adequate.  It cleanly cuts space for bisquits and stock can certainly be joined.  However, the switch does not permit finger control.  You turn on the machine, then position it and cut.  My old Porter Cable overcame this disadvantage and was easier and more accurate to use as a result.  I wish I had bought the Porter Cable model again (mine was stolen).",3.0
"The blade itself is good but it comes with no markings whatsoever, no or limited directions and it is nearly impossible to get off and on your saw spindle. I believe it actually scored the threads on my spindle because now it's hard to get the nut on for thinner blades. For almost $90 I'd expect the blades and chippers to be marked.
Once you do get it set it cut decent but I'd go with another brand if I had to do it over.",3.0
"Maybe I shouldn't complain; I got this product on sale. However, everytime I cut a dado I have significant tear out on the back side of the cut and the bottom is ANYTHING but smooth - so I smooth it with a float. Also, the plastic holder broke, but I suppose that is just the way plastic containers are. As the other reviewers mentioned, hang on to your instructions - they are just a small piece of cardboard. If I had it to do all over again, I would read the other product reviews and invest in a higher priced dado set and hope that the bottom of the cut is close to being smooth. There are a lot of folks that like this product, so maybe I just got a lemon.",3.0
I will preface my review with a blanket statement.  Every tool has its job.  For crude joinery I think this is top notch.  For fine woodworking I would never use this.

"This plane must have the roughest sole of any plane I've ever seen, but with a lot of work, I managed to get it flat enough for my liking. I had to start all the way at 120 grit, and work up from there. After about an hour, I still had roughness in the middle where it was slightly concave, but at least the edges were all polished and flat. It's certainly not a premium plane, but it's also less than $40, so you can't expect miracles. The hardware attached to the plane is a bit flimsy and cheap feeling, and is a bit fiddly to get set just right, but for the price, it's not too bad. It's certainly good enough for a backup.",3.0

Got the job done but the blade is not very sharp and it wants to easily move around on you.,3.0
"I purchased the ""Quality Steel, Sheffield England"" version of this plane (Stanley 1-12-060) from Lee Valley as a introduction to planes. The model here is basically identical. I now own a Lie-Nielsen 60 1/2 (about $160). The Stanley plane out-of-the-box will sort of remove with-the-grain shavings from soft wood after you sharpen the blade.

I tuned up this plane by flattening the sole on sandpaper on a granite surface plate. Given enough time, you can mirror-polish the sole with 2000 grit wet-dry sandpaper, but in my case there are still two small inclusions in the casting where I would have needed to sand another 0.010"" off the sole to remove them. Then I filed the contact points for the blade (Dykem prussian blue helps for finding where the blade is making contact) and I filed the throat/mouth to a smooth opening. I then inserted a ""E ring"" from Home Depot's hardware cabinets on the shaft of the adjustment screw to take up some of the backlash. I then flattened and sharpened the blade on sandpaper as well.

Note that you don't have to flatten/lap the entire back of a plane blade as you would with a chisel - only the edge needs flattening. A 0.010 - 0.020"" thick piece of plastic (such as from a report cover or file folder) to prop up the other end of the blade is ideal for this.

I did this work when I was a beginner on planes - I am explaining all this to show the work you will need to do to get an acceptable level of performance for cabinetmaking or furniture making. If you are a contractor who hangs solid core doors all day and can carry three sheets of 3/4"" plywood over your head, and wants something to knock off a high spot on a door, maybe this plane will work for you as you will have the arm strength to ""make it work"" for cutting with the grain. Trying to trim end grain will be futile - you will either get dust or splinters.

I then purchased an A2 steel replacement blade from Lee Valley ($30). This is a significant increase in performance. You can usually trim end grain with this blade on a plane you have tuned up. With this blade I use the plane routinely for tasks like trimming edge banding flush with plywood and it works fine for that. However, I have at least ten hours of work in this plane, plus another $30 for a real blade.

I then bought the Lie-Nielsen, took it out of the box and tried it, only setting blade depth. This is double the cutting performance of the Stanley plane with a real blade. The little cam that applies pressure to the blade on the Stanley, which always loosens in use, is replaced by a brass thumbwheel. The stamped lever to adjust the blade square to the mouth is eliminated - you just move the back of the blade on the L-N. It cuts with the grain or on end grain with reasonable effort. Why is that? Well the blade is 0.130"" thick and it sits on a large, carefully ground, 1.5"" long surface in the body of the plane. You can buy the slightly thicker LV blade for the Stanley, but you can't really change the limited contact area of its casting nor the overall looseness of how it holds the blade.

So, if you want reasonable performance from a block plane, you can either buy a L-N, or you can get halfway there by doing about 10 hours of work tuning up the Stanley. At minimum wages in the U.S., you will have invested about the same about of money either way. On the other hand, a power sander can do many block plane tasks reasonably well if you don't mind the dust. Also, keep in mind these block planes are made for trimming cuts under an inch wide. They are not a substitute for a three-pound 4 1/2 size smoothing plane you push with both hands.

I also have one of the Lee Valley block planes. It's pretty good as well if you prefer the Norris-style blade adjustment.",3.0
"Got the saw from Tool Crib.  Assembly of the saw went smoothly.  Fit and finish on it are great.  When I went to unpack the fence rails, I saw that they were smashed at one end, so I had to send for another.  When the replacement came, the rail that the fence rides on, looked like it was painted with dust still on it..a really bumpy surface, so the fence wouldn't ride very smoothly on it.  The next rail set was the same thing.  The third one sent was ok, but not what I would have expected having already seen the saw.  I accepted this set because I was tired of waiting.  After installing the rails, I started adjusting the fence.  I soon found that when I set the fence 90 degrees to the table in the front, the rear of the fence was not at 90 degrees...the fence seemed to be twisted!  Also, the right side of the fence was not parallel with the left side.  Four fences and weeks later, the fence I have is close, but not dead-on, as I would expect from Jet.  I am truly disappointed, because some Biesemeyer-owning friends of mine measured their fence's angles and found them to be dead-on!  It's too bad that such a great saw as the Xacta saw is brought down by an inferior fence system.  How can they expect to compete with Delta and Biesemeyer's reputation with less than the same fit and finish.  They have great customer service, but is that enough? By the way, the Jet mobile base is not nearly as stable as the Delta mobile base.  Jet's sits on 3 wheels, while Delta's sits on 2 wheels and 4 leveling pads.  A much more stable mobile base.  Knowing what I know now, I'd go for the Delta, with the Biesemeyer...just a little more money, but probably a lot less headache.",3.0
"In addition to this router, I also own a Porter Cable 890 router so in my evaluation of this Bosch 1618EVS I compare the Bosch router against the PC.

There's much to like with this router.  It's powerful and the soft start and variable speed works very well.  I like the control the D-handle gives me.  I feel much safer starting a router with both hands on the handles than having to let go of one handle to click a toggle switch on the top of the motor.

The two major things I don't like about this router are:

1.  It's difficult to take the motor out of the base and to put it back in again.  When I received the router, it was obvious that something about the base just doesn't work well.  And if you're like me and take the motor out to change bits, this gets to be a hassle.  If you loosen the clamp bolt sufficiently to allow the motor to come out/go in easily, the base doesn't clamp tightly enough and the depth of your cut changes as you're cutting.

After fiddling with the motor and base a while, I found that a small amount of lubrication between the motor and base works wonders - the motor becomes easy to put in and take out.  I need to see if this lubrication becomes a dust magnet and whether it holds up (how often I have to re-lubricate)

2.  The other thing I'm not happy about (but this isn't as serious as the first) is the way the fine adjustment works.  On my PC, the fine adjustment is continuous.  That is, I can crank the router completely up or down using the fine adjustment.  The PC has a lever for coarse adjustments, but using it is up to you.  The Bosch has only a limited amount of fine adjustment.  Once you use up the fine adjustment, you have to go back to the coarse adjustment and make a major adjustment up or down, then run the fine adjustment to the other end of the adjustment screw.  You don't hit this all the time, but, when you do, it's a pain in the butt.

So why did I buy this router?  The PC 890 series does not come with a D-handle with a power switch.  The PC switch can be activated either on the top of the motor or lower down on the motor so you can switch it on and off without letting go of the handles - but I just wanted a D-handle router for non-router table use.

Would I buy it again?  I can't say yet - I need some more time with the router to see if the motor/base problem comes back.

I also want to add a SAFETY pitch.  Soft start routers cost a bit more than fixed speed routers but the startup is significantly safer.  If you buy a fixed speed router (non-soft start), you'll be fighting the startup torque every time you use it.  It only takes one time - one little bit of inattention on your part - and the router will jerk out of your hands on startup.  It WILL happen to most woodworkers at least once in their careers.  And for what you spend at the emergency room, you could have bought several soft start routers.",3.0
"My original purchase intent was the Milwaukee, but I purchased the Bosch based on favorable reviews I read.  .  I find the height adjustment to be a little on the weak side.  The locking clamp will not sufficiently release the motor body for movement unless the tension is backed off with a wrench.  After setting the height, the clamping pressure does not feel secure enough so I had to re-tighten the tension with a wrench.  Maybe it would work, but I am not interested in the router bit pulling down into the work and ruining the job in order to find out.",3.0

"I purchased this maybe 7 years ago, and never really used it. I forgot why, and started playing with it again. Now I remember why: the cutting blade is not exactly parallel to the bottom plate. That is a problem; when the surfaces to be jointed are being slotted from opposite directions this deviation doubles, making it hard to get exactly flush jointed surfaces. When making things like fine hardwood tabletops out of joined planks, this matters, a lot. It is slightly better when I use the fence instead of the bottom plate. But the problem with the fence is that its adjustment is very crude; a minor touch of the adjustment knob gives a huge adjustment. Just trying to center the cut on the edge of a piece of plywood takes an enormous amount of tinkering and trying. I am happy with all my other DeWalt tools, and it came with a nice storage case. Seems powerful and durable.",3.0

"This plane was purchased for use with a Ray Iles toothing iron for smoothing out areas where a LN 62 with toothing iron won't catch due to body length.  I have a few representatives of Stanley's block planes (15, 18, 60 1/2) of vintage or antique age, and this modern plane is of decent enough quality, although the adjustment mechanism and hold-down plate for the iron seem a bit thing and cheap.  Gone is the graceful cast iron adjustment lever and it has been replaced by pressed sheet metal.  This is also true of the hold-down plate.  Luckily this one had a decent QC and I purchased it directly from Stanley, so there are no tune-up issues with it.

The original iron I use here and there, mostly to tidy up end-grain, but I have better planes for that.  With the Iles toothing iron this plane works well on knots, plunging grain and other grain that normally suffers pull-out from standard plane irons.  After that using a No. 3 or just sanding down the patch (or using a thumb plane, come to that) usually does it for those areas of grain that standard irons just don't handle well.

For what it is, it is serviceable.  The adjustment and fastening mechanisms don't have a solid feel to them, but they do work.

Pros
- Good casting and QC
- Modern steel iron does a good job on end-grain
- Accepts Ray Iles toothing iron, making this a far more versatile tool

Cons
- Sheet metal replaces cast iron parts of vintage or antique versions
- Japanning has been replaced by modern paint
- Does not have the rugged feel of vintage or antique Stanley block planes

Worth getting for the added versatility and for the price it was a toss-up between a modern or vintage version.",3.0
"I have owned this biscuit joiner for about 10 years, using it primarily for cabinet carcasses and edge joining boards to make large panels. My only other biscuit joiner experience is using a Lamello, which has unparalleled construction quality and design for a similarly hefty price.

This tool is well built, comes with a good sharp blade, is easy to adjust with a large, solid fence that stays square when locked down. The rack and pinion fence movement is nice and makes fine adjustment relatively easy. I have no need for more than number 0, 10 and 20 size biscuits, and the cut depth was fine out of the box. I also find it helpful to have centerline markings on all sides of the joiner body and fence which I use to align the tool when plunging into the middle of a board. Dust collection using a vacuum is excellent; the included dust bag fills up very quickly.

Here are some of my trade offs, from most annoying to least:
1. When plunging into the edge of a board you have two choices: either rest the tool on a flat surface against the foot plate for a fixed cutter height or adjust cut elevation with the fence at 90 degrees. When resting on the foot plate I find the cut is not quite centered on 3/4"", which becomes a problem when you then want to switch between the foot plate and using the fence at 90 degrees for each half of a joint. When resting the tool against the fence it's very easy to lift the tool up so it is not sitting flat on the board face. I tend to have one hand on the workpiece, holding the fence with my thumb and use my other hand to pull the trigger and plunge. Since the handle is so long I tend to lever it up inadvertently, resulting in a slot that isn't centered on the edge of the board. Taking greater care between cuts will prevent this, but putting the switch closer to the front of the tool would also help.
2. Getting the cut centered on a piece of 3/4"" ply takes some trial and error. There is a triangle on the fence scale at 3/8"" but I still need to fine adjust the fence to get the cut centered. Centering the cut is not always necessary if you keep track of joint orientation but I have mistakenly reversed joints in the past and had to re-work. A positive detent or setup gauge to set the fence for 1/2 and 3/4"" plywood would make this much easier.
3. The protruding pins intended to hold position during a cut are mediocre at best. The machine tends to jump when initially turned on, forcing you to position the tool while it's running that risks inadvertently starting to plunge before the machine is lined up.
4. I wish the alignment markings were a bit thinner. Not that it matters much; biscuits are pretty forgiving when it comes to axial position, but I like being able to perfectly align the tool. With the red alignment marks being ~1/16"" thick it's possible to have significant misalignment.

In all this is a solid, easy to use and reasonably precise tool that is a good value for the money. I'd like to see a few design improvements to make setup and alignment easier but with a little care and practice these deficiencies can be overcome.",3.0

"This is a nice plane for the price. It is fairly well built and will do the job. When i bought this I bought the Sealy and Shop Fox as well. The Sealy is well, a piece and should be struck from your list. The Shop Fox is far superior to either in machining, tolerances, and aesthetic beauty. The Stanley is not machined nearly as well and shows the parallel machine lines all the way down the sole and sides. Further it has more side play in the iron and is not tightly machined to fit with the other pieces. Having said all that it is a very serviceable plane. If you are on a budget or are going to through it a tool pouch with other tools and metal objects this is a great plane. If you are going to have a plane on the bench and it it has a safe place in your shop and you appreciate fine craftsmanship the Shop Fox is the one I would recommend. On the other hand, if you are buying this type of tool you probably rate craftsmanship pretty highly or you would not bother with this purchase.",3.0

"I have owned this particular Stanley plane for about three years.  I bought this tool when I first headed down the rabbit hole of hand tool woodworking.  Out of the box I was disappointed with this tool.  The blade was not sharp and the sole of the plane was very rough with several high spots. After several months of limited use I honed the blade and put a nice edge on it using wet stones up to 8000 grit, and this helped a lot but tear out was still a big issue for me and I did not trust this tool for my finer finish work.  Recently I spent about an hour honing the sole with sandpaper and a 12"" sq tile of granite.  I started with 80 grit and removed all but the worst of the low spots and then moved up through progressively higher grits up to 800 and then put a fine finish on it with a 1000 grit wet stone.  Now the sole is almost completely flat with a few exceptions in non critical areas.  You are looking for the plane to ride flat on the work surface and the area around the mouth needs to be flat and true.  I also completely dissembled the tool and cleaned the rails inside the adjustable toe and made sure the rest of the tool was clear of debris and waxed to prevent corrosion.  I also took some time to flatten the edge of the plane iron that contacts the blade.  The plane works well now and cuts a thin shaving on end grain leaving a smooth finish.  This version of the Stanley block plane is much much cheaper than many other small block planes on the market and the fit and finish does not come near rivals like lie nielsen or veritas or the boutique tool makers but with some care and elbow grease you will end up with a fine tool that will do the job you need it for and will last you a lifetime.  If you need a tool to work out of the box spend a few hundred more, if you have the time and patience or lack the cash, buy this tool and you will be happy.",3.0

While I missed a few hours of TV, I now have a plane that meets my needs and I still have a lot of money that didn't go for the more expensive model that i coveted.",3.0
"Cuts well.. for a little bit - plywood seems to eat them up pretty fast and that is all I cut with it. 1/4"" ply is fine, no chip-out. 3/4 ply seems to kill the blade. Regardless, I was thrilled to find this size blade in a plywood tooth configuration.",3.0
"Okay, you need to reverse the blade on cheaper siding, It will tear the siding up if not reversed. that surprised me that a designed  saw blade for vinyl has directional cut marked on the blades and you have to be smart enough to go against the company direction marked on the blade.",3.0
"If you have some time and skill to fine tune this plane, it has the potential to be a useful tool.  I was initially taken aback by how much refining the plane needed.  I don't mean just honing. It comes with an edge that needs work before it can be honed to the point I would call it sharp.  The other parts fit tightly, causing you to fight them just to make an adjustment. I expected better fit and finish.  I like a plane, or any other tool to work smoothly, like it was  passed down to you from your grandfather.
It isn't something that a little time and patience can't fix.  And I suppose that you could make the argument that this fine tuning will make you more familar and thus more confident with this tool.

First, as has been indicated in other reviews, the instructions are not good.  The pictures don't jibe with the product (for example, the rail sizes re quite different despite what it looks like in the picture.

Second, the rail is meant to ride on plastic pads, which would be fine but the primary level cams onto the rail and depends on that plastic pad, which fell off in shipping.  I called Jet and they suggested that I epoxy it into place,which I did but the cam is really tight...maybe the thickness that is the glue under the pad was to too much

Third, there is a knob by which you can tune the back fence height to match the height at the front.  But there isn't much about it in the directions and what's there is not helpful

Fourth, the arrow in the window is pretty far off the rail, tough to read it accurately, though if would usually hand measure anyway.

Fifth, there is not one word in the instruction about how to use the resaw capability of the fence.  The instructions simply say to attach the post with the hand knob and to center ot on the blade. Not sure why else to do with it.

"I grew tired of the awkward to align splitter/blade guard on my Delta CS and these seemed like an ideal way to get some anti-kickback protection.  The idea is that the wheels, which sit at an angle, hold your stock to the  table and against the fence.  Since they only turn one way, a work piece  that binds against the fence and the blade can't shoot back at you.  You  should also get more square cuts since the work piece can't drift away from  the fence.
They seem well made (cast aluminum bodies, large yellow  rubber-like wheels), but there are some problems.
Mounting is the main  problem.  The mounting base that comes with them has a 4"" x 2""  flat bottom that is a problem to attach to most fences.  The picture on the  packaging shows them using some kind of aluminum insert to ride in a TS  fence extrusion -- this isn't included.  Short of drilling holes in your  fence, the flat bottom bracket that comes with the Board Buddies isn't  exactly mounting friendly.
I mounted mine to my Unifence by switching it  to the ""low"" position, and mounting a plywood assembly to the mounting  extrusion used when mounting the fence in the high position.  The Board  Buddies mount to the plywood assembly.  The main problem with this (or any  Unifence mounting) is that the Unifence isn't designed to have much upward  force on the back side of it.  Unless I'm careful about the height of the  outfeed wheel in relation to my stock thickness, I can really get a lot of  lift on the fence.
The wheels are raised and lowered by turning an  eyebolt that presses on a plastic wedge that pushes the wheel arms up and  down.  This plastic wedge is very soft plastic - mine came out in the  course of mounting them, and it already had a 1/16"" ding in it from the  eyebolt. The wheel arms and body seem to have a certain amount of friction  between them, which keeps the arm motion from being completely  smooth.
All in all, I think this is a smart safety idea that actually  seems to make my cuts a little more uniform and arguably safer. However, I  think Woodstock needs to work a little harder on making their design  mechanically smoother and a lot easier to mount non-destructively on common  fences.",3.0

"I bought this to mount Board Buddies on my Dewalt-744 table saw.  The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

I need 4 or at least 3 and 7/8"" to clear for the aluminum T track, that extends off the back of the wood fence,  so I call Grizzly and they have not returned my call yet, and gave no suggestions in my first contact, but I down loaded the SHOP FOX W1624 manual, which is very close to the Grizzly G1035 unit, but one small difference, the cast fence parts have a removable ""factory hold down bracket""  (in the Grizzly manual it actually shows the SHOP FOX version of the shaper in one picture,  so I took the wood board fences back off removed the T track, and took it down to the metal shop and proceeded to saw off the ears and then I put the pieces on the mill and trued them up and squared off the back side so if I ever wanted to in the future I can bolt some thing on to work as an bracket or what ever,  I take it back up to the wood shop and cut the board fences back down to 3"" and attach the T tracks and now they are easy to adjust and appear as if they will work as advertised,

#3 THE MOUNTING BLOCKS THE WHEELS SIT/SLIDE IN CRACKED WHEN I TIGHTENED THE SPOON-LIKE HOLD-DOWN SCREWS! It took me three tries with JB-weld for it to hold since the plate is so thin there was very little surface area for the JB-weld to stick to. It finally did but I haven't used them for very long to know whether or nor the bond will last. I just don't tighten the hold-down screws as much as I would like to.

By the time I finally got it assembled and attached so it would work properly I was so frustrated, I was sure they were going back to Amazon but I tried them after a full cure of the liquid steel and they worked quite well so I decided to chance it.

If you have time to mount them properly and don't mind torn-knuckle-skin AND DON'T TIGHTEN THE SPOONSHAPED HOLD-DOWN SCREWS ON THE MOUNTING PLATES MUCH (hand-tightening them should accomplish this; use of a tool is very highly NOT recommended), then you will like this tool and in fact, I've seen nothing like this on the market.

If working with boards longer than 6'I would recommend purchasing three 2packs.",3.0
"I am writing this review in response to the negative reviews. It seems to me that if used properly, it can be very effective.

I have pictures of glued up panels to prove it.

The main purpose of the clamps are to remove crooks from the lumber.  The second function is to put a ""straight"" edge on the board.

To achieve either of the objectives, one must use a true straight edge as the guide board.  Longer stock will require more than 2 clamps.  2 clamps will be good up to about 4 feet.  Additonal clamps should be used about every foot after that (my estimation. (i.e up to 5 feet, 3 clamps).  This means you would need to get another set.  The technique I use is the make an initial pass.  Then remove the board from the clamps, place the side you just ripped against the fence and rip again.  Lastly, flipped the board over and rip the first side again.  That should give you stock that should be adequat for glue-up.

Some additional tips, invest in a good saw blade (Freud Diablo), this will help minimize vibration and give a nice cut.  Check the guide board periodically to make sure it is straight and true.  Always cut you stock over size and then trim it to fit.

The clamps are not as good as an actual jointer and require a bit more work, but it is cheaper.  Infact, I have used these in conjuction with my bench top jointer.  And a little more advice, if you are looking to get a bench top jointer, go the extra $200 dollars and get yourself a bigger one (6"" x 47"") if you have the space.",3.0
"I bought this to replace my UHMW insert, which cracked after nearly 20 years of use. While this was just about as easy to set up, after several months the blade still scrapes a little and makes more noise than I would like. I'll keep this for a spare, but will order a UHMW for everyday use.",3.0

I've been using mine for about three years, and have been pleased with its durability and stability.  I have made a bunch of shop-made inserts myself (1/2 inch Baltic birch with self-tapping machine screws to adjust the height).

"Alright, heres the story.  First one purchased was horrible.  The blade was so out of alignment with the fence that you could visually see that the cut wasn't aligned.  You could see it just by pushing the blade out and holding the fence close to the blade.  One end of the biscuit slot was about an 1/8th higher than the other side.  I went to adjust it, and could remove only some of the problem.  When it was at it's maximum adjustment it was about 1/16th out of alignment with the fence.  I sent it back to amazon.com.
I decided I was going with Porter Cable, but didn't want to wait for a shipment, so I went to Home Depot.  Ended up with a second Dewalt Joiner.  This one looked ok in the store so I thought I'd give it a second try.  It's pretty close to perfect.  I may not need to adjust it at all.  I am building a china cabinet and don't want to screw up the oak.  I think this joiner will be perfect for me.  I'm very pleased with the second joiner from Dewalt.
I think overall Dewalt makes very good stuff.  I've been very pleased with their stuff in the past, and was very suprised at the problems I had with the first one.
Overall, I'd say I give this second dewalt joiner a 4 or maybe a 4.5.  Since my first joiner was so bad, I'd have to give it a 1 or a 1.5.",3.0

The ease of the biscuit joint concept is outstanding and the DeWalt is a good tool--However--be sure the slot cutter is aligned to give parallel slots, mine is not, was not out of the box.

Now after nearly a year the slot varies 1/16 which makes it tough to get smooth joints. The problem is in the guide slot inside the body and the error can be seen by looking into the slot opening. I am waiting to see if DeWalt comes through with a fix or Porter Cable here I come.",3.0
"The reason for the 3 stars is the metal flap that the belt slides over and contacts the wood wasn't flat. It left dish marks all over the wood I was sanding. I remedied it with a 4"" wide piece of cloth back granite over the metal flap. It smoothed it nicely.",3.0
"Bought this sharpener on the recommendation of a youtube video. I tried using it right out of the box, but soon discovered that the platen on which the blade holder rests was warped about .015"". The thought of repackaging and returning prompted me to attempt to flatten said platen myself. I am a retired toolmaker but without the use of a surface grinder, it took me two days of rubbing and scraping. The machine works well now but has a steep learning curve in order to achieve desired results. That said I must admit I have never had sharper jointer and planer knives. I recommend you check the flatness of the platen right after unpacking and return it if warped because the machine won't work the way I received it",3.0
"Plate jointer is an interesting tool. The rotational axis of blade is perpendicular to the axis of motor, thus there is a gear mechanism that changes the rotational direction. For this reason, the tool is noiser than other power tools, and you get a lateral jerk when it gets started. At the same time, the precision of the tool is easily revealed by a planer joinery. It is hard to find one that meets everything.
I have compared it with Porter Cable and Makita. I like Dewalt's design that allows both one hand and two hand operation. When every part is in good condition, it works reasonably well. However, I can't understand why the cut depth is much deeper than the biscuit size. In my opinion, Makita is the best among three for its design, smooth plunge, and no lateral jerk.",3.0

"I owned this joiner for a short while.  Luckily, I purchased it at my local Home Depot so returning it was not a problem - only the tool was.  The problem with mine was that the fence was not parallel with the blade. It may be possible to adjust this, but I could not readily determine how to do this.  The fence was not set square (90 degrees) from the factory either, but that is easily adjusted.  The fence problem combined with a loud motor prompted my decision to return it.  To be fair to DeWalt, I opened every other one in stock at the store; they all had the same problem.  This may have just been a problem with the batch that my store received. On the plus side, it was light and easy to operate.  The dust collection worked well with just the bag, and the ""rack and pinion"" fence adjustment was a plus.",3.0
"I'm no pro with biscuit cutters, but unlike my other DeWalt tools, I found three problems with this right off the bat.
One, it clogs after about 5 cuts, sometimes after 3, for #20 biscuits in ash.  The shaving port has a  metal projection in the middle of it (too keep fingers out?).  I'm  contemplating removing it.
The fence angle indicator is not even close.  Not a big deal, it is too crude to use reliably anyway.
Third, when  edge joining, the cut is not parallel to the surface of the board.  If I  make two cuts side by side, the right-hand cut will be a bit higher on it's  left side, than the left-hand cut is on it's right side.  If that makes any  sense to you, it indicates that the machine is not trued to the fence as is  should be.  If this is fixable, I have yet to figure out how.  The  discrepancy is fairly minor, but I'd sure like it to be better than this.
It seems to be a good product, but not as good as a DeWalt should  be.

Makita 9403 belt sander is an excellent product but my machine arrived with a few issues that buyers should look for.

I was able to align the belt using a channel lock on the screw but I should have returned the sanders if it weren't for the fact that I need the sander for a home project that coming weekend no time to return it and get a new one in its place.

But, have always had good luck with Dewalt tools, so I decided to save 40 bucks and buy the Dewalt. Wish I had of listened to my gut feeling.  The Dewalt is heavy duty and has great power.  But, I am cutting through 2 1/2"" of foam with poly straps in it (ICF forms).  The Dewalt is heavy to use cutting horizontally on a wall.  You can't grip it very well so as to hold back the blade guard when doing a plung cut.  It just isn't ergonomically correct.  I will probably love it when cutting timbers on my next job though.  It is meant to be a beefy wood hog, not a cut out opening in ICF walls saw.  Reminds me of a Black and Decker I used framing many years ago.",3.0

If you invert the logo so that the lower trap area of the bag is down (as shown in the 2nd pic), then it does become much more effective. However at best, I've found it captures only 60-70% of the saw dust.

"I gave the Forrest WWII blade 3 stars based on the price compared to its performance.  Originally, I purchased a Freud LU83 blade for my Craftsman 1hp table saw.  I was very impressed with the performance and the cuts of the blade in pine, red oak, oak plywood, and 1 inch melamine.  The only exception was the occasional burns (in red oak) when I slowed the rate of feed to reposition my hands.

Consequently, due to all the hype about the Forrest WWII blade not burning, I bought the WWII to satisfy my curiosity.  I installed the WWII in the same position as the LU83 to make a fair comparison.  When I turned on my saw I did notice a difference between the sound of the WWII compared to the LU83; The WWII was more quiet and appeared to run smoother.

However, the difference in cutting was negligible.  I cut an 8 foot 3/4 inch piece of red oak and had a slight carmel like burn along the entire length of the cut. At that point, I was glad Forrest offered a 30 day money back guarantee because I was disappointed.  I then reviewed the table saw setup proceedures included with the WWII and followed their recomendation to raise the blade 1-2 inches above the top of the wood.  I completed a second cut without any burn but the smoothness of the cut was no better than the cut with the LU83.  I completed several cuts in pine, red oak, oak plywood, and melamine, and none of the cuts excelled the LU83.

After using both blades I have to say dollar for dollar, the Freud LU83 outperformed the Forrest WWII.  I'm quite confident if I would have raised the blade for the Freud LU83, as I did with the Forrest WWII, it would have alleviated the occasional burns. The fact is, the Forrest WWII is more than double the price of the Freud LU83 but it does not perform twice as well.

For the cost, I was very impressed with the Freud LU83 but believe the Forrest WWII blade should have performed better.  In fact, I was so impressed with Freud that I purchased a Freud 80 tooth Diablo for my Radial Arm saw and a Ridged 90 tooth (Made by Freud) for my cut off saw and I am very impressed with their performance.

The best part is that I bought all three blades for almost the same cost as the WWII blade.  Please don't get me wrong, the Forrest WWII is a great blade, I just believe the Freud LU83 is equally as good for half the cost.",3.0

"Router arrived in good shape. Overall the unit has plenty of power for most jobs. Like some other reviewers, I too have trouble with the trigger release since it is not a natural motion (maybe that's by design, I dunno). The plunge stop is easy to set. The spring is a little stiff so it does take a bit of effort to plunge the unit down. The electronic variable speed is relatively easy to set. I'm concerned, however, that dust and chips seem to build up around the variable control and work their way behind it. The first few times you use the router it seems a little odd in that the motor ""spins up"" slowly unlike a traditional fixed-speed router which runs full-tilt almost instantly. Bit changes are relatively simple. A spindle lock is provided. I didn't have any problem with the 1/4 inch collet like one of the other reviewers did. I still find myself using my old fixed-speed router for a lot of applications where I don't need the plunge capability (e.g. round overs, simple edge profiles, etc.) The PC unit accepts a variety of standard collars which is great for some applications.",3.0
"Overall I like this router, it's not too heavy, easy to move about, and it's Porter Cable so it should be tough.

I have been using this tool for better than 15 years as a master carpenter, suffered thru years of having to buy over priced Fein blades.
When looking for a sanding pad in my tool box, I came across several original velcro pads from original Fein purchase and discovered that they are far superior to to even the new Fein pads. It appears that they changed the manufacture for the newer tools. Too bad. I will be trying the Makita and other replacement pads to find a suitible replacement for my worn out ones.",3.0

"This was a tool that I didn't need, and couldn't even know for sure if it would be useful. The reviews seemed a bit mixed, but I'd had such good luck with Forest that I decided to give it a try. I'm a hobbyist woodworker and spent quite a bit of time in the shop. I have a Jet 3HP cabinet saw. I mostly use a rip blade and and an 80t cross cut/plywood blade. After using this for what ... a year now? I really can't tell a difference. I can say, though, that it dramatically decreases my capacity, as the dampener hits my ZC insert. In fact, I even allowed it to burn through the insert so that I can at least raise the blade up to where the dampener's right at the top surface of the insert. I rip a lot of thick, rough sawn lumber and also use the saw to resaw lumber (either entirely or by starting the two cuts and then bringing it to the band saw). I need all the blade I can get.",3.0

As it is, the consumer has to figure out by ordering other pieces to try to make connections.  I have a 4"" OD fitting coming out of my saw.  This 4"" fitting is exactly the same, so I, by guessing, picked a 4"" rubber connector with clamps, and it happened to be 4""ID.  Looking through Amazons selection of adapters leaves a person guessing, because few if any of the descriptions are there or accurate.",3.0
"My Fein Multimaster is a wonderful tool.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.  Having said that, the sanding pad (with loops) wears out fairly quickly and like many of the Fein accessory attachments, it's much too expensive.

"The velcro is the weak element of these pads.  But of course it's the velcro that makes the pads, which are otherwise well made, so convenient.  You can easily destroy one of these expensive things in minutes-- while thinking how cautious you're being. So resign yourself.  There's a way to avoid it, but it takes care and control:

Let the tool and unworn sandpapers do the work. Do NOT bear down.

Avoid using the tips if you can use the edges, avoid using the edges if you can use the whole surface (This is obvious, but keep repeating it to yourself).

Invest in sandpapers of the graded grits that span the needs of your projects; in use, resist skipping grades; they exist for good reason.

Rotate the tips (and yep, the edges will follow) frequently, BEFORE they are worn.  Heat build-up can damage the pad underneath long before the paper is done for. Rotating allows you to inspect the pad (and paper) while letting it cool some. If possible, use two different sides or edges by shifting your grip.

A note on the sandpaper: If you are sanding painted surfaces, especially at corners and joints, the paper will clog quickly, and more so if you are not using coarse enough grit; so, inspect several times per minute. Frequent use of a small wire brush can help unclog the paper.  And repeat, ""Rotate"".

"I cannot see any improvement in smoothness of cut using my Freud blades, which is why I bought the product.  The machining is pretty rough on this item.  The faces of the dampener are machined like a standard saw blade, which is fine, but the outside surface is so rough it looks like it was cut out by a band saw or ground with a very rough grinder.  With something that roughly cut it raises doubt in my mind about the degree of balance of the disk. It makes me wonder if this is really manufactured by Forrest, which has very high quality saw blades.  On the positive side the surfaces of the disk are very flat, I cannot see any light under my Starrett precision ruler at all, except near the hole.",3.0

This is a general weakness of blastgates of this design - it is better to use ones where the shutter extends all the way through the body of the gate, so debris gets ejected out the opposite side when the gate is closed.

You only need to either plug the hole in the bottom of the filter with a plastic plug you can get at Lowes or any car parts store or use a 3/8"" x 2.5"" carriage bolt, nylon washer, and wing nut to more securely fasten the filter.  Better filter, better price, easier wet/dry vacuuming.",3.0
"When you buy a woodworking tool, the manual doesn't warn you, but if you do a bit of research you'll discover that prolonged exposure to finer dust (smaller than 1 micron, or the size of smoke particles) can lead to sinus and lung problems; some serious. Most shop vacuums come with filters that retain dust as small as 5 microns (a piece of copier paper is about 100 microns thick). If you want to protect yourself, you need a HEPA filter, which will retain particles smaller than 1 micron.
This filter is pretty expensive, but without it, why buy the vacuum? For woodworking and sanding, a shop vacuum without a HEPA filter is probably a waste of money.
Commercial dust collectors large enough for larger power tools, that remove particles smaller than 2 microns, are not yet available at home shop prices. So even with a HEPA filter, if you're using a power saw, planer, etc., you should also wear a respirator with HEPA filters and have something to clean your shop's air before it goes into the rest of your house (and before you remove your respirator). The alternative is to shell out more than the cost of the power tool for a suitable industrial grade dust collector, or to build your own (there are instructions and parts on the Internet).",3.0

The adjustment knob does not fit tight and is not easy to get at when using this router on a router table.

"I like this router but I'm not too impressed by it when comparing it to my original 90's DeWalt, DW625
Which is considered by many to be the best router of all times. Plain and simple.
M12v is a good router for the money and you can't beat the 5-year warranty. Why I'm not too impressed?

First the negatives compared to original DW625:
Plunge depth very limited. Can't use extreme long bits.
The collet dept for bits is not deep enough as in DW625 and could create a problem vibration with longer bits.
Soft start not that soft. Especially if you increase the speed during cut, you will get kick back.
This is extremely loud router.
No  collet only reducer.
Plunge lock very crude.
The height adjustment is coarse threaded rod and requires many turns. Recommend Router Raizer if you are using it in the table.
Bit opening very small, can't swing large router bits. Will need to cut off the ears.
Plunge action not as smooth.
Looks like they've changed the base from older M12v's and most likely the motor quality? this base is so bad that the guide doesn't go through. I will be exchanging mine and hope the next one is better otherwise it's no way on this MALAYSIA made junk even for the price.
It's made in MALAYSIA and not japan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you can find a used one that's made in Japan get it otherwise?

The positives:
Dead on accurate as far as the bits being 100% perpendicular to the base from all sides.
Much better looking than the new M12v-2 which is the ugliest router in history.",3.0

"I have purchased & used 2 of these routers in the past 3 years. They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start. My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful. First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day. Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits. I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars. When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money. But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece. Then, without warning, it took off again. Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger. I use these routers under a table. Outside of needing an extension for half inch bits, which is a problem for most machines of this type. Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working. You must keep double checking depths. But, for the money it is a good machine. Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years. The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will. I am now waiting for this one to stop. For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy. For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit. If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!",3.0

If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.",3.0
"I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.  Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.  The adjustment nob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the nob.  I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.  The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.  Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.  I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
The next year when I was at the show again, I went to the CMT booth and took a closer look at how they were using the router.  I noticed they cut out the wings in the center that were preventing the use of the bigger bits.  Also, they did something to extend the lock mechanism and had a bent wrench which allowed then to tighten or loosen the collet from the top side of the table.  In fact, they were selling the wrenches they had made up.
Long story, short answer, I cut the wings off, bought the bent wrench and everything except the fine adjustment works fine.  I use a Porter Cable router when using 1/4 inch bits.  I have each router mounted on its own plate and can change them out faster than I could change collets.  It was alot less money than the other routers of its size and power and for the weekend woodworker, it is a good investment.",3.0

The second is that after a short ammount of use I found the collet lock to be a pain to work and when changing bits the collet suddenly let loose and teh wrench hit the depth adjustment turret and broke it off.  Also after just a few months of light use the plunge rods began to stick and teh router needed to be pried apart and cleaned.  I had to clean it four times in an hour on one occassion.

"A decent table, altho there is a couple things that could be improved on. first off not sure why they designed it with the router mounting plate and miter track so close to the edge. it leaves just a few inches of table left with lots of room behind the fence. now the fence can be mounted on the opposite side but that means u cant use the miter track anymore, plus that makes the door on the backside of ur work area. so if u want more room u have to sacrifice not being able to use the miter track, which isn't a huge deal to me as i don't use the track that often, but its still a bad design that could have been easily fixed. im also not a fan of the router mounting plate. there are no inserts for around the router bit and the hole is too small for a raised panel bit. i luckily had a spare plate that had inserts and i was able to cut the plate down to fit. but i shouldnt have had to do that, it would have been very easy for them to have made a larger hole and inserts made for it, even if they were just cheap plastic ones. now to be fair to this product i need to list the pros....i like the smooth melamine/mdf material the table is made out of. the fence is very well made and sturdy, i would give it 5 stars on the fence design. the cabinet is well designed and sturdy. i mounted a triton tra001 router in it and with the supplied template, it was very easy to drill the holes for mounting it. altho they didn't have it marked for drilling a hole for the height adjustment crank, but with a couple measurements it was fairly easy. but overall i was disappointed, with all the high reviews that this table had compared to the bosch ra1171 which was my second choice, altho it probably has its problems also. i should have just went with the bosch ra1181. i already have one and it has more table room, router plate inserts, feather boards, easy access power switch that can also have a shop vac plugged in so with the flip of a switch my router and shop vac both turn on, plus it was cheaper. but i didn't want an aluminum table and i wanted my router to be enclosed and i didn't go for the bosch ra1171 because it only had 3 1/2 stars. i would have sent this table back and tried it but since i was able to use a different mounting plate for this one, its working out fine",3.0
"I have had this router table for about 10 months now.  Pros first. 1) The table is solidly built, heavy enough to not move around when I am using it, but light enough to be somewhat portable. 2) The table top dust collection works fairly well once I adjust the fence (if you buy it you will see what I mean). 3) The miter gage from my Shopsmith 510 fits the miter slot on the router table.  Cons. 1) The leveling screws rattle loose and fall out no matter how much I tighten the lock nuts. Maybe lock washers will help. 2) The table has no adjustment scale for the fence, annoying but workable with practice. 3) The two pieces of MDF that come with the fence are not the same or the fence is bent, because my work pieces usually get hung up on the far side of the gap I leave in the middle of the fence for dust collection.  4) There is no dust collection port for the cabinet.  I vacuum the cabinet and blow the dust out of my router to keep things clean. 5) The screws holding the miter gage slot also come loose over time and have to be regularly checked.  6) The screws holding the table top to the sides come loose and have to be retightened (are you seeing the trend?)",3.0
"After reading all the reviews, this table seemed like the best choice for the quality/cost ratio.  First, the good.  It was very well packed and arrived in perfect condition.  The instructions were good enough to complete the assembly fairly easily if you are handy (if you are buy this, I assume you are handy) although some of the pictures were incorrectly marked.  The quality of the finishing on all the wood and metal components was very good.  The fence is easily adjustable and the top is flat.

Complaints:  first, the back cabinet piece was a little shorter than the sides (maybe 1/32"")  This caused a slight bow in the top when I screwed in the back center top bolt.  I shimmed it a bit and tightened the bolt to fix it.  Second, as noted in several other posts, the vacuum port on the fence back does not fit any standard shop vacs.  Since this is a portable table, it will likely be hooked up to one.  I finally modified a shop vac connector with my dremel tool to make it fit.  Third, and most frustrating, is the ridiculously fiddly adjustments for the router plate.  After spending about 1 1/2 hours putting the table together, I spent the next 45 minutes trying to get the plate to lie flat.  With no success, I attacked it again a couple of hours later,  both with and without the router attached.  I got it close enough to use, but it still is not 'just right'.  Maybe it's just me, but I suggest extra patience.  It should not be that difficult to level the darn thing.  I can't imagine living with this plate long term.

In retrospect, although this is a nicely made table, I would likely buy something else if I had it to do over again.  I expect my tools to work and be easy to manage.  Add in the fact that you also have to provide your own switch system (this is clearly not included so it is not a direct criticism) and I think there are much better options for your money.",3.0

So, I don't really have a complaint about this item.  It just didn't fit my saw.  It looked like it would serve the purpose it was made for, however, I found that buying a zero-clearance insert and making a zero-clearance dado plate was the best way to go for both price and performance.",3.0

Besides it not having an on / off switch on the outside there is 2 other things I don't like about it. The router plate doesn't have a scale for easier and quicker fence adjusting.

Fit and finish were very good except that I had to break out the drill and drill 2 holes in the top of the sides that were not done.  Kind of disappointing.

Also, the fence could have been better designed as to allow for easier adjustment.  Also, the instructions are difficult to interpret and the parts numbers do not correspond with the written instructions.  With a better top this could have been a winner.",3.0

"Have to say it took a little bit of time to put together but nothing too hard or too vague.  Mine didn't include hex wrenches but they were standard and I had them so no big deal.  What is a bigger deal is the dust collection port.

I plan on doing dust collection via shop vac.  Mine has a standard 2 1/2 inch hose which according to Bench Dog is supposed to fit their dust collection port.  It does not.  I took the port with me to The Home Depot, Lowes and Sears but could not find a 2 1/2 inch hose that would fit it.  So much for standard.  I called Bench Dog support and it seems they have been acquired by Rockler.  Rockler has revised the port and while I had the newer one some were made with a smaller ID.  Seems like someone forgot to tell mfg that the wall thickness was supposed to go on the outside and not the inside of the opening.  They sent me the revised one.  That took two weeks because the first time the order didn't go out.  After waiting the normal time to call, they said oh, gee it didn't ship so will try again.  They included a free set of hold downs as compensation and this time it did ship.  But it still doesn't fit any hose I could find.  The ID is exactly 2 1/4 inches.  That is what a standard 2 1/2 inch hose fitting is supposed to be apparently.  However it is actually about 2 5/16 with most being fitted into a 2 3/8 coupling.  So if the Rockler people would have made this at least 2 5/16 or 2 3/8 things would be fine.  I ended up buying a 1 1/4 to 2 1/2 adapter, cutting the 1 1/4 part off and duct taping the rest to the dust port.  Works fine.  I suppose I could have sanded my hose end down some as well.

The table works fine.  Nice and solid, etc.  Would have been nice if they would have included an external switch as it is obviously unsafe to open the door to turn off the router.  Using a Triton router and had to drill holes to mount.  Bench Dog includes a paper template with the proper hole spacing.  These were accurate so that was a non-event to do.

I would give the table a 5 if this review was just confined to that part.  Having to fool with the dust port because they can't check the fit on a hose by buying and trying a few before spec'ing and the lack of an external switch makes this just average for the cost. Even Bosch on a less expensive table includes a switch and presumably a dust port that fits a shop vac hose.",3.0
"I recently purchased this table from amazon and the shipping was quick and it arrived timely and in great shape. There are plenty of good reviews here to read so I won't go into a lot of detail about the table itself. It is well built and is a very good table for the $.

I will just share my experience with the table since it arrived. First, the instructions are not accurate. There are several steps in which the picture does not match the parts. Particularly, the bit guard in the box does not match the one listed in the manual and the subfence construction is completely different. Its like they updated or changed parts on this model and didn't bother changing the instructions. Nothing wrong with the subfence itself, it just doesn't match the book and makes it unclear how to put it together.

Most importantly, there were a couple parts missing from the box I received. The hex wrenches that are supposedly supplied were not included; no big deal since I had plenty. The dust port was missing as well as the whole set of bolts used to attach the router plate to the router. So I emailed benchdog from their website requesting the missing parts and also included some suggestions for the manual. Its been a week now and I have yet to hear anything from them at all.

All in all, this is a great table if you don't have to deal with benchdog and you actually get all the parts that are supposed to be included. This may be an isolated incident for all I know but I just wanted to share my experience for what it's worth.",3.0

"I purchased this plane to clean up and fit small tenons and rabbetts. It was inexpensive and I did not expect really high end tool when I bought it. It was delivered promptly and, as with all my planes, I immediately disassembled it and tuned it for use. The bottom is very flat and it didn't take much to knock down the few high spots. This blade is not even close to being ready to use out of the box so be prepared to start from scratch. The back of the blade wasn't too bad but it did take a little work to get it flat. A few minutes on my DMT stones gave me a surface that I could work with. I used a jig and worked my way from my coarse diamond stone, through the grits and finished with rouge and the leather strop and finally got an edge on the bevel that I was satisfied would work.

As I stated earlier, this is a very inexpensive tool and it shows when you try to set the blade for work. It is clamped in place with a single thumb screw and you must be very carefull to make sure that the blade is square with the plane when you set the blade. To begin with, I set it on my table saw top and placed the blade so that it was level with the bottom. I snugged the retainer thumbscrew and proceeded to tap the blade down and test it until it would cut fine shavings from the surface of a pine board. I still can't say that I have it right where it should be but I can use it for what I bought it for. I keep it in my apron and go to it when I need to adjust a tight tenon or small rabbett. The blade seems to hold the edge pretty well and has only needed a touch up on the very fine stone and strop to keep it working.

You shouldn't expect much from this plane and you won't be dissappointed. Be prepared to fiddle constantly with the blade position to get it to work. IMO if the mouth were tighter, and it had a machined slot to hold the blade laterally, it would be much easier to adjust and it would work much better. Lateral adjustment is completely by trial and error and it doesn't hold its position very well in hard woods. I only use it for very small tenons and rabetts. Anything over a couple of inches long is done with one of my larger rabbett planes.",3.0
"I was several hundred miles from home and my shop, helping a friend with a kitchen remodel. Got to a point in the cabinet portion when we really needed a rabbit plane badly. He ran down to the local hardware store and this one was all that they had. I have several older stanley planes and they are good tools. This one disappointed me quite a bit, as it is not up to the Stanley standards I have seen and used in the past. It's pretty roughly made, the adjustments are kind of a joke and the blade doesn't hold a very good edge. We finally got it to work and finished the cabinet doors, but halfway thru I was ready to drive home and get my Lee Valley/Veritas bullnose rabbit plane.

I gave it 3 stars because it will work if you mess with it enough, and it is inexpensive. I think if someone bought it as their first one, they would probably never want to use one again. Save your money and buy a good one from Lee Valley or one of the other quality makers. Can't recommend this one.",3.0

"Beautifully made, but there is a problem......

I use it for a Dewalt DWE7491RS and the leveling screws are way too short. After trying to adjust the fitting, it was just impossible because the screw bottom out. Leecraft uses M4-10 machine screws and I had to run to the hardware store to get the size M4-12mm and a mere 2mm made a world of difference. Leecraft, take note of that. Nothing frustrates people more than having to stop everything to make a trip to the hardware store to get parts to make things work which should have been taken care of by Leecraft in the first place. Makes you wonder how come Leecraft dropped the ball for such a quality item by overlooking the importance of including the correct leveling screws.

On another note.....a lot of input from people here claim that this insert cannot include the riving knife. Well, it is not true. At first I followed the instruction of using a band saw to extend the slot for the riving knife, but that did not work too good. I wasted an insert because you need to perform multiple passes on the cut to match the width of the riving knife. There is a better solution. Read the input from another fellow reviewer.

Lastly, I did know before deciding to purchase this that there wasn't any type of lock to secure this to
the table. Instead, they add a small phillips screw to one end to be friction-fit into the table opening along
with 2 cast tabs at the other end.  This would have been better if made like the Dewalt insert which came

"So, here is the deal.  I would have given this product 5 stars, except for their consideration (or lack thereof) for those of us who bought riser block kits for our bandsaws.

The blade guard that came as part of our riser kits has a long slot in the lower half so that we can telescope the two-part guard for very high or or very low cuts.

The blade guard that comes with the Carter set does not have this slot.  When I tried to substitute the riser kit guard, it did not fit due to hole placements, and a cut-away needed to clear the upper thrust bearing on the Carter assembly.

So, patient fellow that I am, I e-mailed the Carter company, and over two weeks later, I have never gotten a technical response.

I then proceeded to redrill holes and cut away steel on my existing riser guard.  The value of the Carter guard was that of a template for modifiing the Riser guard.  And, an hour of labor later, the guide now fits and works well.

The other reason I downgraded the rating, is that on my saw, the thrust bearings (behind the blade) do not line up, centered on the blade.  The adjustable Jet height shaft that it mounts to, is notched, with a flat surface where the allen screws seat. I do not have much adjustment there.  And, I can't seem to find any other way to move the bearing left or right, so that its center is behind the blade. (The adjustments are all designed for forward/backward.)  It's kind of close to opposite bearing edges, for the top and bottom guide assemblies, so I hope I do not end up with any problems there.

Now, here's the kicker - In researching Carter guides for other riser block owners on this issue, I discovered that Jet now has their own Euro style, all-bearing replacement assemblies (and, available here on Amazon.)  And guess what?  When I inquired about the riser issue on the Jet company site, they not only got back to me in 24 hours, but they offer the replacement guard for free! - but only to Jet guide buyers.

Bottom line - You owe it to yourself to at least look at the Jet product before you buy this one.  I know nothing about the quality of the Jet bearing assemblies, but I can attest to their responsive service, and their attention to the variations of modified Jet bandsaws.

And just to be fair to Carter - I also bought their quck-Tension release lever assembly.  Excellent engineering, and that went on as advertised, and works very smoothly.  Five stars for that upgrade.",3.0

"I bought this expecting a 3 star item and that is what I got, however here are the modifications I made and will be making more to hopefully bring it to a 4 star.

First off I could have gotten a dust deputy but I didn't want to deal with the additional height of the 5 gallon bucket as where I store this is under a work table.

Here are the list of modifications I made
*  I purchased 2 - 5 gallon buckets. I cut a hole on the INSIDE of the bottom of one of them to leave the walls intact for rigidity. I then sealed and taped the cyclone to the bucket I cut. I then drop that bucket into the other bucket unmodified.
What this does is give an air tight seal between the buckets and instead of me messing with the cyclone to remove that, I simple slide one bucket out of the other and dump that bucket. This itself has worked amazingly well. I have found catching medium to large size debris works great. Catching fine dust however doesn't and still seems to make it into the shop-vac. This is what I need to solve to get this up to 4 stars.

Modifications I plan to make.
* The bucket falls down all the time, I need to build some stand for it on rollers to keep it up right, or change my layout a bit to remove its ability to move.
* I want to play with the inlet of the cyclone to see if I can resolve why finer particles are making it to the shop vac. The manual states to put some water in the bottom of the bucket to catch those. Admittedly I have NOT done that yet so I will try that as recommended to see if that does help, however with a bucket 1/2 full of shavings, I fail to see how water added then will help but I will try.

If anyone else has suggestions on the finer dust particles let me know and I'll try them too.",3.0

"Works, but not without some modifications.  There is no gasket or seal between the lid and the trash can so if you don't add one, the leakage is substantial.  I ended up using some one sided sticky back window seal gasket along the inner rim and then using a bungi cord between the trash can handles across the lid to put pressure on the seal.  I tried vacuuming with my 2-HP HF dust collector without the seal and almost everything went into the bag and almost nothing in the can.  This was after a long lathe session so the chips, dust and shavings were plentiful and the separation should have been far, far better. After adding the window gasket material, the separation was markedly improved.  On the hole, if you consider the cost of building a Thein baffle (and don't have all the scrap material necessary in your shop), it's definitely a cheaper option and worth the purchase. I happened to have an old galvanized metal trash can that I painted with Rustoleum when I purchased this so my investment was minimal.  I'm satisfied with it now after the modifications, but would have otherwise sent it back for a refund.  Your choice, but in all honesty, a roll of $4 window seal will make this a worthwhile purchase.  There were also absolutely no instructions other than a sticker on the lid that tells you which side is the inlet and which the output although, without any actual baffle built in, I don't see where that really makes any difference.

I bought this clamp to assemble mitered trim on doors and windows. It will clamp the pieces but won't pull the joint together. Turns out it is much faster doing it by hand. I am a professional carpenter and find this is too fussy to be efficient on the job site.  Also it won't accept 3 1/2 inch trim.

"The Woodstock dust separater is a disappointment. The Woodstock is top heavy so you have to put a weight in the bottom of your bucket. Also no gasket comes with the Woodstock so when you get it hooked up the first time you are losing suction so now I have to make a gasket for the Woodstock.

"I have done tests on this, and it has surprised me. I have read other reviews that were largely negative and having seen it in a store thought that the comments about poor quality might be fair. I spoke to a sales associate who said that while this little guy was new for the store they had been selling its larger sibling for about five years and they hadn't seen it come back from customers. Because I needed something right away I bought one. First thing it doesn't appear to be substantial when you look at it or hold it, but it is much better than first appearances might suggest. People have complained that it is loose on the bucket and suggested ways of putting gasketting around it to make it seal better. Don't do it!. It fits just fine. Yes, it is loose when the suction isn't turned on this makes very easy to empty the bucket, when the vacuum is turned on it seats itself very firmly and I was able to pick the whole thing up by one of the hoses hold it securely in the air and move it about without worry that I was going to spill its contents. Regarding  the sizes of the holes for the hoses. I was using a Shop Vac brand hose and it fit very tightly in the hole. Don't be afraid to push it firmly into place. I wanted to test it out so I had saw dust, wood chips, small pieces of paper and other fibers to try it out on. But what I intend to use it for in the near future is drywall compound dust, so I used flour and salt as substitutes. The results were impressive. I was using the standard Shop Vac 2 1/2"" hose between the vac and bucket, and a 1 1/2"" 25' hose from the bucket to debris. Everything was picked up quickly and completely. 98% of the debris remained in the bucket instead of going into the vac. The flour was the most common item that made it into the vac, but still only a small percentage made it past the bucket. Finally, I wanted to see how it handled water. I sucked up over a gallon of water and not a drop made it into the vac, I was amazed. So yes I think it performed admirably. However, compared to the videos I have seen of the dust deputy's performance, I would suggest the dd out performs this unit but not by a lot. It is easy to empty the collection bucket and keep clean, so it is definitely my goto separator for cleaning out the bilge on my boat and other messy jobs. At 1/3 the cost of the dust deputy it out performed my expectations.

[UPDATE]  I finally got a chance to use it on drywall compound sanding. On this task I must say it failed miserably. 60-70% of the compounding dust passed through the bucket into the vac and the vac's filter. So, yes it technically is slowing down the filter clogging that I hoped to eliminate but not enough to make it a satisfying solution. The typical cyclone competitors, have a vacuum point that is several inches below the incoming debris port, providing opportunity for debris to fall out of the air stream instead of being sucked through to the vac.  The Woodstock Mini 2-Stage Cyclone Separator however has both the income port and vacuum port on the same plane and literally right next to each other with very little barrier between them. This design apparently doesn't provide enough opportunity for the light weight ultra-fine power from drywall sanding to fall out of the air stream and therefore sucks through to the vac and ultimately its filter.

So for heavier dusts (sawdust, silica, metal, etc) and chunckier debris this unit works satisfactory, but for powder type dust look for something else. By the way, there was a suggestion that putting some water in the bucket could help with lighter weight dusts, but that was not my experience. The water made the bucket easier to clean-up, but it didn't appear to significantly trap more of the dust.",3.0
"I used this clamp on 1 inch pine while building a train table for my son.  I thought it 'generally' did a good job with right angles, but it wasn't as precise as I had hoped and after using it twice, I switched back to bar clamps for right angles and got better results.  It was also tricky to line up two pieces of wood vertically.  I'm not sorry that I bought it, but I think it will take some experience to learn how to use it to get perfect right angles.  Maybe it's best to use these in pairs depending on the joint.  I think I'll get more use out of it on other projects.",3.0

"It is an Okay product that provides some improvement, but not great, in dust collection prior to the ingested air reaching a dry-filter equipped vacuum cleaner.  As attached to a five gallon container, the Woodstock captures about half of the incoming dust in my shop.  What you see is what you get:  the incoming and outgoing vacuum tubes simply push into to cyclone separator and are more or less securely held by friction.  Other companies make better cyclone separators at considerably higher price.  This unit is well suited for applications where the available installation height is a limiting factor.  It is not, in my view, a true cyclone separator, but rather one that functions by a physical separation of several inches of the incoming dust-laden air stream and the outgoing somewhat-cleaner air stream.  One or two competing products of similar size and function are on the market and I recommend reading reviews on such products before buying.",3.0
"Unit is plastic and seems to be well made. It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy.",3.0
"Okay, I admit I've never even seen this thing, but here's what I think anyway, based on the picture; this is not designed like a ""real"" cyclone separator, and all my reading and engineering knowledge tell me it can't work as well as if it were.
  A cyclone separator is tapered like a funnel.  As the dirty air enters from the side near the top, it spins around the inside wall, and as it is forced down toward the tip of the funnel it spins faster and faster.  Centrifugal force throws the denser dust & chips to the outside wall, where there's a very thin layer of slow-moving air due to friction; the crap slides down the wall and drops through the bottom opening into a sealed container below, while the cleaner air reverses direction and shoots up the middle of the separator(!) and out the hole in the center of the top (i.e. to your shop-vac).
  I would never believe this could work if I hadn't seen it, but it does.  If you have the room for it, and the patience to mount it, I recommend spending a few extra bucks on a real cyclone like the ""Dust Deputy"" (Rockler??).  Mine works great.

"My first job was to clean the sawdust out of my table saw.

The holes were not sized very well and I had to really work at getting the hose nozzels in.  It just sits on top of the bucket and is held on by the vacuum.  Obviously, when the shop vac is off, it does not hold very well.  It is top heavy and falls over regularly.  But with great care, I filled up the bucket with sawdust. It does trap much the sawdust instead of putting it into the shop vac bag.

Would I buy it again?  No.  I would cut a round piece of plywood and cut two holes for the shop vac hose, then bunge cord it to the bucket.  Put a weight on the bottom so it does not tip over and presto, you would have a much better dust collector.",3.0

"This Jorgensen vise has great features and a nice level of fit and finish. The mounting template supplied with it was spot on, perhaps it was fixed after other reviewers complained about it. I did have one significant design related installation issue however. I would have never anticipated that the vise toe-in feature, for superior grip, is machined entirely on the fixed jaw portion of the vise. The moving jaw is machined at a nearly precise 90 degrees to the guide rods while the fixed jaw cants outward from the bench about 1/16th inch from bottom to top of it's machined face. This is exhibited clearly with the vise mounting face clamped directly to the benchtop under-surface and the face mounting screws properly installed.

This causes 2 annoying issues. First, a clamped object within the tightened jaws becomes tilted away from bench face. A board clamped on it's faces for example is not at 90 degrees to the bench surface. Any edge planing or joinery work must anticipate a noticeable lean towards the user. Second, my plan to embed the fixed face within the bench profile and to have a continuous jaw created by the bench edge was now totally foiled. Doing that would eliminate the toe-in feature completely, and would require an angled mortise relief of the bench top.

Neither issue would have arisen if the toe-in was on the moving jaw as I had anticipated. Kind of a dumb approach for a big outfit like Jorgensen.",3.0

"ad said to use with 20 gallon trash can. No way possible. I was fortunate to obtain (free of charge)at a roofing work site, a 50 gallon barrel with a removable top that was held on by a circular adjustable collar.  I used the dust collector for a pattern to cut a circular opening in the barrel cover (two inches less than the o.d. of the dust cover) I had a roll of 1/2 inch wide, double sided sticky tape for a seal, securing it to the barrel top with pop rivets around the perimeter. The outside dia. of the dust cover met the inside edge of the barrel cover real close, I then made a final seal around the perimeter for a real tight seal.  The gate adapters that I purchased from Amazon. com flopped around when I attempted to secure them. (no flanges on the holes of the inlet and outlet) I overcame that by securing a small block of wood inlet and discharge ports at the 3 and 10 o'clock position outside of the ports and was able to use a long sheet rock screw thru the edge of the gate cover.  Be sure drill the holes for this fix, so the gate can still operate. I couldn't have made a better container for my wood chips to collect in. Also I bought a box of 52 gallon heavy duty bags at Ace Hardware to emty the chips into. They're about a buck a piece and I ask anyone taking a bag of my chips to please bring the bag back if they want a refill.  P.S. to make it easy to empty the barrel into the bag, my son and I lift the barrel up onthe tail-gate of my pick-up truck and simply tip it over.",3.0
"I picked this up to go with my Father's Day gift, a Delta 50-760.  I have a small shop and I will only be running one machine at a time.  I connected it easily and it worked well.

I compared this to another from Woodcraft but WC did not have one in stock so I decided on this to save a few dollars and a few days.  I should have held out.

Compare:

- This one does not have a foam gasket seal, WC does.  There is a loss of suction where the plastic lid meets the metal can.
- The fit is loose on the can so you have to use a bungee to hold the cap down.  It is prone to coming loose while the dust collector is not running - (Do not know about the other)
- This one requires you to either thread a higher quality hose into the opening or purchase clamps and connectors separately.  The WC has a connector built-in so all you need is a clamp.

"Anyone that has a dust collector knows how much it sucks to empty the bottom bag. I can't afford a cyclone nor do I have enough ceiling height.

Pros:

1.  It does separate the large pieces/particles very well. Works great with the planer and jointer. About 5% of the dust still makes it into the bag unless you let the can fill up. Then the bag gets really full. Don't ask

2.  Easier to empty a can than a bag. I bought a 44gal rubbermaid trash can from Lowe's and it was a perfect fit and much larger than my bottom bag.

3.  Prevents anything metal from getting into the impeller

Cons:

1.  Hose threads in. I bought two of the Jet 4"" couplers and gorilla glued them in. No more leaks.

2.  No way to secure the lid to the can. Like everyone else, I just used a bungee cord.

"You will have major problems if you blindly follow their install instructions. The drilling template they provide is off by a full 1/2"" --- be sure to measure the vise itself before you start drilling into you work bench --- AND --- I suggest you give thoughtful consideration to the mounting lug bolts they provide and the pilot drill size they suggest. They provide 5/16 lug bolts they say are 2.5"" long but the ones I got were not even a full 2 and 1/8"" long PLUS they say to drill a 1/4"" pilot hole. That large a pilot hole in soft wood will not give you much of a bite (especially size 3/4"" of the lug bolt length will not be in your work bench but will be passing through the flange of the vise itself. I used 3/8"" lug bolts with 1/4"" pilot holes (nominally 2.5"" long; 2 and 3/8"" actual length). They also do not supply any hardware to attach wooden face plates to the vise (1/4""-20 bolts being required for one side and wood screws for the other side).

"First of all: If this is all you can find, still get it! Mine works fine. However, there are some models out there that I think would be easier to hook up (google trash dust separator).

I couldn't find a trash can that fit exactly (it fits a 21 inch external dia. can and I could only find a 20 inch dia. can). I put some air conditioner foam around the edge of the trash can and this sealed it fine, however. I thought I'd have to strap it on the trash can but you don't...it sits on fine.

There is no clear fit of the hose to the openings, so I did this: I drilled a hole in the top of each hose entry point and ran a 8 gauge 10-32 bolt through the top and into the 4 inch hose where it entered the top. I put a washer on the outside on top of this unit and a washer and nut inside the hose and thus bolted the hose to the separator. The hoses now fit snuggly and securely.

I think the separator is a great product and adds life to vacuum motors/fan blades and makes chip disposal a snap. The only disappointing feature was that when it arrived there were no hose connections. However I also ordered the 50 foot hose sold by the same manufacturer. It has a spiral wire in it with a web of soft plastic between the spirals. By turning the hose a few reverse turns you can then screw it into the collector nozzels (no clamp required).  Having a soft web between the spiral wire allows the supple plastic web to be drawn up against the nozzel edge to form a seal.,3.0
"i bought this tool when it first came out and it has broken 3 times under light-to-medium use. i could have purchased a whole new tool by now. each time it has been the same problem, the clutch mechanism breaks. the clutch mechanism is linked to the piston that moves the blade back and forth. the clutch stalls the blade, in the event that the blade is pinched, like when cutting a stud at the bottom plate and the the weight of the stud soon shifts onto the blade, sending all that vibration into your arms. the clutch also prevents over torquing the motor. when it works, it's awesome. now i use my dad's old 4 amp milwaukee. this tool was built to last. i'm not sure why the new milwaukee isn't built like their older tools. my ""super"" sawzall broke, the last time, while i was cutting 3"" out of a 8x12 lintel/header (in a single story) to accept a new door at the proper door height. the constant pounding of the blade against the pine lintel broke the clutch. i finished up the cut with my dad's 4 amp.

after my milwaukee failed me, i considered switching to a different tool, instead of repairing my not-so-super sawzall, for the third time. i've looked at the new boschRS20 13 amp, but it doesn't have anti-vibration, like their older models. it's a beast to use and it cuts only medium fast, at 2,800 SPM (strokes per minute). i've never used the hitachi CR13A 11amp ""swing-action"" sawzall, but it's supposed to be twice as fast an orbital saw. it's cuts faster than the bosch. it's an older tool, with no gadgets, but is still a great tool. a great value too. the porter-cable angle-adjust TIGER CLAW 9747 is a great saw for cutting in tight spaces, where no other saw can get to, and an overall great tool. it cuts at medium speed, at 2,900 SPM. the HILTI WSR 1400PE, with ""smart power,"" is by far the best recip saw out there, but it's a bit heavy&costs almost 300.00(with side handle), but you can't put a price on quality. you can get a carbide blade for it, the first ever that i know of, so it will cut cinder block and clay pipe and cut out a window in stucco&metal lath with ease. the smart power lets the motor run at consistent speed, instead of ""bogging-down"" during the cut, like every other tool. technically, it has a faster SPM than other saws; it just cuts faster. new in 2005, is the MAKITA JR3070CT 15 amp saw. i know previously that makita recip saws have really sucked, but this one has been re-engineered and is now the MOST POWERFUL RECIP SAW EVER! (besides the HILTI). it has all the features you need, counter-balance (anti-vibration), clutch (different than milwaukee's), 4-speed orbital, etc. it cuts very fast. dewalt recip saws are just ok. if you must buy a dewalt recip saw, like if you need it to match your yellow truck or other dewalt tools, buy the DW309k 11.8 amp. dewalt makes other great tools, their recip saws just aren't as good as HILTI, MAKITA, HITACHI, BOSCH and PORTER-CABLE.

so many companies are forgoing quality and adding gadgets to their tools to get people to buy them. i just want quality. now that home depot/rigid owns milwaukee, i hope their quality doesn't drop any further.

SEPT 2005: i'd like to add, that the new MILWAUKEE 6523-21 13 amp, 3,000 SPM SAWZALL has partially restored my faith in milwaukee. it is comparable in power and speed with the MAKITA JR30CT, according to stats. i just wonder if it will hold up under pressure.",3.0
"Out of the box, everything worked except I couldn't see any difference between orbital and standard cutting.  I contacted customer service through their web site and asked how to tell if this feature is working.  The site said they would respond in 24 hrs, but there was no reply after a week.

On my own, I figured out how to check orbital action:  Take a new white blade and put a black dot on it with a permanent marker.  When you run the saw, the dot appears as a straight line when standard cutting and should appear as an oval when set to orbital cutting.  On this saw it was always straight no matter the position of the orbital control.  So orbital cutting was defective.

The manual says that if you put the blade in upside down, it turns off orbital cutting.  I tried the blade both ways, no difference.  To sense the orientation of the blade and affect the heavy duty drive train must have been a pretty sensitive mechanism to design.  It looks like they didn't get it right, but maybe they will redesign it some day.

Other than that, I really liked the saw.  I took it back and got the 10 amp version w/o orbital action.  It is 2 pounds lighter and has less  to go wrong with it.  I really would have liked orbital and the extra power, but I figure if they couldn't make it rugged enough to work right out of the box, it wasn't worth trying again with the same model.  And the lighter weight is nice.

The other difference I noticed between this and the 10 amp model is this one has a little dial on the handle that adjusts the maximum speed.  That is, if you set the dial to less than 5 (the max), when you pull the trigger all the way the saw will go to less than the max speed.  This seemed like a good idea, but I noticed that sometimes it would get knocked to a different setting, and I didn't have any trouble controlling the speed with the trigger when the dial was set to 5, so I just tried to leave it there.  It seems like it is just one more thing to get broken.

Neither saw cut like a chain saw.  Not even close, and I had gotten special wood cutting blades for it with very large, very sharp teeth.  My 16"" gas chain saw with a dull chain goes through wood between 5 and 10 times faster.  But this saw will do things a chain saw won't, like cut metal, and it is probably quite a bit safer to operate.  Changing the blades is also cheaper and faster so cutting through tree roots in dirt makes more sense with this than using a chain saw.

For instance, there is one configuration for 1x material, another for 2x material, etc.  This means fiddling with the screws and blocks each time you need to join different sizes of wood, which not only is a little bit of a hassle, but also means that the screw holes will eventually get stripped-out.

"I purchased the Porter-Cable top router table as one who is just getting into routers and using them for woodworking projects. I did several projects for Christmas this past year and used the Porter-Cable 895PK router set with the table. I also purchased a couple books for insights into router table use, etc.

I like the fact that this table is very sturdy. It is made of steel and I bolted it down onto a 1/2"" thick plywood board that I attached to an old rolling cabinet that I've had around in my workshop for some years. No issues there at all.

My biggest concern is that the top of the table is grooved when it seems to me that it should be smooth (i.e., no grooves). In working with some of the smaller pieces (e.g., picture frames), the piece would sometimes get caught in the groove and would not go cross the router bit perfectly flat. I am thinking of cutting a piece of masonite or some other material that will fit on the top of the table so that I have a perfectly smooth surface. I think this is a drawback and negative for this particular table. Other router tables I considered have a smooth, level surface.

I also found that the two fences are not perfectly square with the table, no matter how much you fiddle with the screws. I had to clamp down a thin piece of metal that covered both fence pieces (high enough for the router bit to operate), in order to ensure that my piece was running smoothly across the bit and not getting caught on the left fence piece (a problem I incurred when using the dual fence without the metal piece).

I cannot speak to the vacuum port/attachment on the back side because I'm not using it. I am also not using the clear plastic guard that connects to the right fence because it keeps getting in the way and is more of a bother than it is worth. I think the vacuum attachment might work well, but I still need to get a reducer to fit in the large opening so that my vacuum will connect properly. My guess is, however, that it will soon break off due to the flimsy way it is attached to the table. In the meantime, I'm just creating a lot of dust which I have to remove after each piece goes through the unit (partly because pieces of wood gets caught in those table grooves and hinders the pieces from properly running across the router bit).

All in all, however, I found the table fairly usable and with my adjustments worked very well for me. I give this table three stars because of the grooved table top. I would give it five stars for durability/sturdiness/good construction.

Instructions were a little challenging in trying to figure out how to connect the router to the table; they could be written more clearly I think, at least on that point. But I finally figured it out and got everything together.

All in all, I am happy with the Top Router Table and recommend it to those mostly involved in small wood projects -- that is, with the adjustments that I have commented on above.",3.0
"I had one of theses and it IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE of p/c quality and versatility. I replaced it with a unit from Grizzly, which has a larger table and better fence , and is about the same $$$ when you add buying the on/off switch......",3.0
"It's sturdy, but adjusting the nobs and sliding the fences is not as quick and smooth as I would like. I wish I had spent more and bought a Benchdog table.",3.0
I only bought this machine yesterday but found a design fault almost straight away. I only found it because it almost cost me a [$$$] panel raising bit!  The problem is that the ring inserts for the table vibrate and jump when the machine is in operation.  I'm surprised that PC have overlooked this dangerous design fault. Either use some wooden or perspex ones or find a way of securing the metal ones whilst in operation.  Everything else about the table is fine and it would have received 5 stars but for this fault.,3.0
"Good for regular frames, but not with extensions",3.0
Clamps just fine but you cannot drill the pilot and countersink at the same time. Defeats the purpose of clamping and fastening at the same time.,3.0
Work well but I miss the older version that I had but somehow can't be located....,3.0
Worked great! Thank you.,3.0
"I purchased this plate to mount my DW621 2HP Plunge Router on my table.  I followed the directions and drilled the holes from the bottom of the plate, using the plate from the Dewalt as a template.  On turning the plate over,  I was horrified to discover that three of the four holes I drilled were in  really poor locations.  One was so close to the outer ring that the  required countersink cut into it.  Two were so close to the holes for the  starter pin that they were difficult to countersink without  ""skidding,"" even on a drill press.  Because my tabletop had been  premachined to take this plate, I had to find another plate that did not  have all the features that would interfere with my router's mounting holes.  (Try to find a 9""x12"" plate!)  I settled for a piece of clear  Lexan which I machined to fit the opening in my table and then mounted my  router.
In all fairness, this plate would probably work great on larger  routers with ROUND bases.  This would get the mounting screws clear of the  features on the plate.  The Dewalt screw pattern is basically a narrow  rectangle, which is what caused the problems.",3.0
I purchased these Cabinet Clamps to install my new cabinets.  Overall these claps worked well but I was a little disappointed with their poor cabinet face frame protection and the small leverage screw for clamping,3.0
"I bought a couple pairs of these almost 2 months ago for half this price! I notice that this seller keeps hiking up the price.... I am a General Contractor that does a lot of bathrooms & kitchens & these are a must have, but this seller is way overpriced!!! Shop around.",3.0
"These don't work for frame-less cabinets, but for face frame cabs they let you clamp them together,fine tune the cabinet alignment, pre-drill for the fastener and screw them tight.",3.0
It did not work as well as I expected or as advertised. It  has not been as handy as I would have liked it to be.,3.0
They're a great idea but that's it. They're cumbersome and slow. They are however built well and sturdy. Geared more toward DIYers.,3.0
I was under the impression it came with the drill guide and drill bit that's why I bought it when I got the package it had a note that said the guide and drill bit was no longer included. The Clamps are nice and should work nicely just disappointed the other pieces weren't included had I known I would have bought elsewhere.,3.0
"This time im desapointed  with the guarantee. I paid too much.  They offer you a lifetime sharping service for free  but they charge you  for this. When i do my maths, you are paying too much for this blade, about four times compared with other brands. You can get fine cuts with cheaper blades and don't need to beg for free  guarantees. Honestly find good brands with low cost. they do the jobs and you can buy four for the price of one forrest.",3.0
"Definitely not a ""cure-all"" for the cabinet maker/installer, but a great innovation nonetheless. These clamps do well at holding to cabinets together, but so do my Irwin clamps. They have a hole for drilling and screwing the cabinets together. This is very nice as long as you can place your clamp in the desired area you want to place your screw. As for the adjustment for the faces of the stiles, the clamps work ok as long as they're not too far off from each other. If you have to put too much strain on the face frame adjustment it pulls the side of the stiles out while leaving the middle in causing you more headache than help. Other than that these clamps are a useful tool in my toolbox.",3.0
"The product works fine, but I really don't understand how a seller can - in good conscience - deliver a product that will have 110 volts running through it without basic instructions, a diagram, or anything.

Also, the mounting plate appears to be built to snap into something very specific, but who knows what... It doesn't fit a standard junction box. (But you'll need one, because the back is not enclosed or otherwise protected from dust.)

With some modifications and some trial-and-error, I made it work for my purposes. With some forethought and some basic concern for their customers, the manufacturer could make it far easier, though.",3.0
"Well first off, who ever was doing quality control must have been off that day. On one of the clamps the threads were screwed up so it kept binding. I almost gave up, but I finally work it out. Then they didn't work on my cabinets. My cabinets were custom and the stiles were a little thinner and the clamps won't close up enough.
I do have to say, they do work great on the Home Depot cabinet and for the beginner I would recommend them
I also think they're a little spendy for their limitations",3.0
Not so level. Only discovered it when trying to do some precision work.,3.0
"Make sure you know out the width of the stiles on the cabinets. If the cabinets have inset doors this clamp may not work because the stiles may be to narrow. For the cabinets I just installed with inset doors the clamps did not close far enough to pull the cabinets together (needed them to close another 1/2"" to 3/4""). For cabinets with wider stiles this is a very well made tool that make s cabinet installation very much easier.",3.0
"Works just fine for my quickie shop made router table, at some point I could see wanting something dead flat but this works great for the stuff I need it for now because it was super easy to install and the value was excellent.  I think I would have saved some aggravation over a mishaped mounting hole if I bought the installation template but other than that it was pretty easy to install.",3.0
"Very not mini.  Was looking for a lite weight clamp.  Not this one, weighs a ton.  Works well for clamping but to heavy for a smaller object.",3.0
"You get what you pay for. Its not bad for non precise routing but it is not dead flat. They put the bow in intentionally, they have their reasons but it doesn't fly for me. Will be making another router table and will be using this on my roundover flush trim table. But for main table i will be getting a metal plate. hope this helps.",3.0
"This product will not clamp anthing smaller than 4"" so if you are doing kitchen cabinets with edges smaller than 4"" (corner pieces) is become almost useless.",3.0
I wish I had checked the dimensions of the clamp before purchasing. It dosen't quite reach in behind the stile on the cabinets I install.  Anyone looking for a set at a good price?,3.0
"Although I like the product, one of the clamps' screws is sticky. Little disappointed but not worth the hassle to return.",3.0
"I thought the grip would be stronger because it tends to slide off the pieces especially working with thick wood.  It still helps having these handy like having an extra hand, but I will for sure look for say pressure in grip when purchasing claps again or getting the screw type...",3.0
Not too sturdy to me.,3.0
"It's a mixed lot.

I would put this accessory very much in the contractor bin, and not the fine woodworking.

It's very good value while compared to more expensive plates, but the negative reviewers aren't joking when they comment on the rounded nature of the plate. I have a huge Bosch 3.25hp router hanging from mine, and it doesn't iron out that slightly domed top. This means if you want that flush with your table top, you have to set the edges lower, and that creates a lip around the whole plate, albeit a small one where wood can become snagged. It's not going to be a problem with larger pieces, but smaller pieces can be tricky.
I also found that the micro-adjustment screws are far too loose fitting and shake free with the running of the router. Once level, a drop of Elmer's or hot glue to temporarily fix them in place stops them shaking loose.
Considering the brass inserts they screw into are rather substantial, I've no idea why they used such cheap ill fitting plastic screws to accompany them.

It's cheap though, and machines easily to fit your router. You just need to be aware that it isn't going to be a seamless fit like the heavy duty flat aluminum plates, and so if good enough is okay with you, then you'll be okay with it.

I'm making mine work out for me, but I'm already looking to replace both the plate, and likely the extension table I set it in. A solid 3 stars.",3.0

"I purchased this Milwaukee 6390-20 circular saw from Amazon. It came over a week ago. I tested the saw and it worked, but a part was missing. I searched, but couldn't find it. No rip fence, or the screw to hold it, came with the saw.

My other two brands of saws, a Porter Cable and a DeWalt, did come with a rip fence.

So, I contacted Milwaukee direct because many times Amazon leaves things out of their item descriptions.

The reply I received, over a week after my question, was:

The rip fence is sold separately and will come with the rip fence screw,

So, $21.35 extra for an item that other manufactures of circular saws do include, and it is part of the saw. What next? Will Milwaukee start charging extra for the electrical cord that powers the saw?",3.0
"I purchased this for my home built router table. It's not totally flat, so that part is a little disappointing, but I did install it and I'm using it now. It had about 1/16th inch hump in the middle.",3.0
"These aren't actually for me they were purchased for someone else who uses them for very light duty purposes. This is about all they are good for. They are great for very small items or something along the lines of fabric or thin plastics or things like that. Don't get me wrong they are definitely under wooden quality clamp which is a good thing, but they are just a bit on the flimsy side compared to a couple of other items or size clips from other manufacturers. I would give her win the nod on these over those because these are definitely easier to close an open.

I am afraid that given the price of these related to the usefulness and quality I am afraid that it gets a 3 star rating because similar small clamp items are ranging anywhere from 20 to 40% cheaper with the same quality and usability.",3.0
"These 2"" model do not lock tight they do work well for secondary clamping but if you need a bite and lock. look elsewhere",3.0
"Delivery was prompt and the clamp was not damaged.  Since I clamp in pairs, I had tried to get another but this was some kind of Amazon promotion and I couldn't make it work.  Also, the two inch capacity isn't much good for what I do.  I think I'll opt out of any future promotions of this nature.",3.0
"Seem to be the same old wood clamps, but was incredibly disappointed when I saw a ""Made in China"" sticker on them.  The threaded rod is a bright shinny silver now - haven't used them long enough to know if the quality has dropped or not.  Minus 2 stars for moving production to China.  If you don't care about that, you'll likely be happy with these.",3.0

"I read so many great things about these clamps, and the concept looked so good, I guess I expected more out of them than was really fair.  They do hold the stiles together, but then so do my wooden Jorgensens.  Most of the cabinets I install are in houses with walls that are not plumb or square, and I constantly have to shim to make them look good.

I found that with the center plate that screws in toward the stiles to bring the edges flush, if you don't have the backs of the cabinets shimmed and screwed at least part of the way, they pull the right and left edges of the stiles around toward you.

So I ended up using both my wooden clamps and the Claws and that worked nicely.  I would buy them again, but they are not a cure-all for my cabinet hanging headaches.  They certainly are the most innovative design anyone has come up with in a long time!",3.0

Out of the two I bought:
-one is currently nonfunctional after the release lever came out of place after being dropped from waist height (while clamped around a small workpiece)
-the other doesn't work well without a partner

This tool is not the quality I would expect from milwaukee, I think it is as good or better than any of the other entry level abrasive saws.

"I love the screwdriver, however, the charger is not up to Milwaukee standards.  I have two of the chargers.  Strangely enough, one of them has the name ""Panasonic"" on it.  Both of these 120 volt chargers have the main diodes burned out and another charger cost fifty something dollars on amazon.  I am now trying a 12 volt charger to see if it will last.",3.0
The centerline markings for the drill guide are only etched into the body and are not painted or otherwise differentiated by colour (unlike the old model) which makes it difficult to use.,3.0

"This is NOT A 4 Pack, though it is clearly labeled as a 4 pack, it's mislabeled, not really a great deal for a single 6"" clamp.",3.0
It is as described and also a little weak as others have stated. The clamping force is basically only as much as you can squeeze the handle on a 1 to 1 ratio and the mechanism that holds the pressure is not precise enough to keep the exact same press when released. For the price it is OK but I might buy a better clamp in the future.,3.0
these little guys are great - however the web page shows a retail price of 33.86 - the same item in the catalog is only 23.99.  You do the math - an offer of 21.94 just isn't that  great over 23.99.  Truth in advertising?,3.0
"I had lost my old Dowl-It jig that I had used for 25 years and ordered another one from the company through Amazon. Upon receiving it, I was dismayed that the hole sizes were not labeled on the jig as had been shown in the photo description on the website and also on the product usage directions which came with the product. My old Dowl-It had the hole sizes milled into the metal and they were very helpful. I called the company and was told they no longer do this in order to save money. They were very courteous, but that was a rotten answer. I was reminded of another American company who years ago lived by the slogan, ""the quality goes in before the name goes on"". Sure, I can go ahead and put an adhesive label on the jig to label the hole sizes, but I shouldn't have to. Thanks for letting me comment.",3.0
"I like this for the price, but wish I had gotten another made by the same manufacturer which allows you to drill multiples of the same size hole without moving the jig.

"I have two of these screwdrivers that we use for assembly - probably an average of 500 screws a week. The screwdrivers are great, but the batteries quit working after a few months. We have also replaced several chargers. When the chargers go, they overcharge, and ruin a battery. I also have a 14V Milwaukee drill, and the batteries don't last long on it either.

"I use this cordless screwdriver at work as a HVAC/refrigeration tech. It works okay. Not as strong as I expected and the battery does not last as long as I expected. I had a Craftsman cordless (made by Black & Decker) before. The battery on that one would last a week with frequent use, this one only lasts a day or two. Maybe there is a better battery available, haven't checked. The old one was more for home use so it did break after just a year or so with what I use it for, this one has a 5 year warranty which is good.",3.0
"This is a nice compact power driver for the average homeowner's needs. If you want a good driver for putting toys together, installing and removing light plates etc. it fits the bill.

That's what I was doing on this site.",3.0
"what others have said - cheap clamps, worthwhile for light-medium duty projects, but the pads are not nearly parallel and the whole thing feels a little flimsy.  it works, but this is very much get-what-you-pay-for",3.0
"The clamp surface area is nicely-sized, and the rubber is grippy, and bottom jaw slides up and down easily.
The jaws do not come together cleanly however - the one I got pinches at the front.
The handle works well when clamping down, though the un-clamp snap action is very jerky and forceful.
Downside is that the clearance from the shaft to the start of the jaws is relatively small, only ~1 inch.

These clamps are fine for low pressure clamping but do not have the strengh for really tight clamping.  Try the metal vise grip  type clamps with smooth jaws from Harbor Freight Tools for $4.99 each instead. I use them to clamp knife handles on blades with epoxy. These are fine for light clamping of craft projects but don't pay over $3.50 each.,3.0
"I found this unit to be a clamp with limited specific usefulness. It works well with veneers and held small pieces of wood to be worked. There was too little clamping force to keep large pieces of wood from shifting. It does not have the strength of hold that one finds with a metal c-clamp. To fit my need, I purchased an additional two deep metal c-clamps.",3.0
"I have several of these clamps purchased in the late 90's when they were marketed by American Tool Companies.  They have been fantastic clamps and are the first clamps that I reach for when working on small projects.

I recently purchased some of the newer Irwin Mini Quick-Grip clamps, which seemed identical to the old ones except for the blue color.  Unfortunately, the pistol grip trigger on the newer Irwin clamps does not engage the bar until it has been depressed about half way.  The trigger on my older clamps engages immediately and advances the bar much further for each squeeze.  In searching through the clamps on display at a local store, I found that the trigger action varied considerably.  I was able to find a pair that worked reasonably well, but not nearly as well as my older American Tool Mini Quick-Grips.

The bar on the newer Irwin clamps also seems to be made of a softer steel.  The locking mechanism leaves a groove in the bar each time the clamp is locked securely.  The bars on my old clamps are still perfectly smooth after years of use.",3.0

"The slide bar was to tall for the grove in my table saw, There was a 1/16"" gap under the miter on both sides, I ended up having to use the old bar from the original miter gauge that had broke, I used the Woodstock's slide for a template for the old slide, Drilled and tapped the holes I needed to mount the Woodstock miter gauge to my old slide, I then had to make 2 custom spacer washers for the pivot point screw and the adjuster knob for setting the angles, Now the updated unit sits perfectly flat on the table with no play whatsoever.

"Good jig. Works well, however take care in tightening the set screws. They can  snap off pretty easily. I thought originally it was just my fault but I've heard it happen to other guys. It would be nice with thumb set screw but I guess that's how they used to be and since have been changed. Gives me a chance to dust off the ole screw extractor..",3.0
"I bought this jig to install knobs and pulls on new cabinet doors, and it worked great for the knobs.  Make sure you tighten the screws using the Allen wrench, even if it seems like you can finger-tighten them, and you'll be fine.  It works for any size door as long as the knob or pull is near the corner or edge (as it mostly is).

HOWEVER, the key words are ""for 12-inch drawers""... maybe it's obvious, but it's simply not large enough to use for pulls for larger-sized drawers.  Drawers up to 24"" wide are fine, but they can't be too tall.  For instance, for a 22"" w x 6.5"" h drawer, it works great.  However, I have drawers that are 10-14"" h x 30-45"" w, and this jig is completely useless.  Other reviewers mention doing ""entire kitchens"" but they must have mostly doors, and only smaller-(normal-?)sized drawers.

So, I dropped one star for that, which is probably my fault for not understanding the product well enough before buying.  I also dropped one star because it can seem tight, and then it moves when you go to use it.  Again, probably my fault, but it really did *seem* tight, so make sure.",3.0
"I have used this templete for awhile, it works but the accuracy of it is not very good. Each templete is a little different in height from the each other which gives you different depths of cut. The one that is off the most is the fourth one I needed to buy. The hinge setting pivot that adjust the width of your door is very loose and some keep falling off their pivot. It is made with a cheap little rivot that does not hold up to use at all. I have heard the older models where better and that they cut back and made newer cheaper ones.

It could be a lot better, I was almost thinking of making my own templetes that would be more reliable and accurate. Its hard to beleive that they would sell this on the open market.

I have used the Porta-cable, even thou the Bosch is easyer to set up the porta-cable is built a lot better.",3.0
"We have a high end millwork shop and often build large quantites of custom doors and jambs. I recently purchased a Delux Bosch hinge template kit to speed up production of our doors. The template itself is a very good product and works well, however the kit arrived with a router bushing and bit to mortise 1/4"" radius hinges. Before opening our millwork shop, I was a commercial/residential contractor for 27 years and have not seen a 1/4"" radius hinge for 20 years. The standard hinge for door manufacturers is a 5/8"" hinge. I spent 4 hours going through the enclosed instruction manual and calling local tool suppliers trying to find out what I needed to cut a 5/8"" radius hinge. There is no mention whatsoever in the instruction manual refrencing what is needed to cut different radiuses. The next day I spent another 3 hours on the internet and Bosch's website trying to determine what I needed to cut a 5/8"" radius hinge and while Bosch does reference different parts for the template by part number they do not tell you what the purpose of these parts are. I contacted one of the largest Bosch distributors in the southeast and drove 2 1/2 hrs to their place of business. After working with 2 salemen and the owner for 3 1/2 hours we finally determined what was needed to cut a 5/8"" radius hinge with this template. The solution to this problem was for me to purchase a fourth router( Bosch of course), a bushing and bit at an additional cost of $285.00. Including the time and travel expense I lost trying to mortise 47 doors, I could paid for 35% of the cost of a production mortiser. To make this short, I will not purchase another Bosch Tool until they drastically change their, instruction manuals, website and cataloging of their tools. I CAN""T AFFORD THEM!!!!!!!

"I got the Gatemouth bag as a gift from my son two years ago.  The bag looks great, has lots of pockets and sure seems strong.  I use it to carry emergency tools in the truck of the car.  I have not overloaded the bag.  I was very disappointed when the stitching on one entire end panal failed and the bag literally fell apart.  I've tried to find warranty info or company contact for this item but have not been able to find anything.  The company is owner by Fiskars but I find no support for the Bucket Boss line on their web site.  There's a possibility that I had a bad bag.  I liked the bag so much while it functioned that I am ordering a replacement. I hope this was just a fluke.  The design sure seems just what I need.  The company really should stand behind the product though.

"I chose a three-star rating because it wasn't all I'd expected or had even been advertised.  First, it said it had a padded bottom, but it really doesn't -- maybe an extra layer of denim or whatever it's called -- it is pretty tough fabric but that's all (one of the items I keep in the bag that is being tossed in and out of my car is a camera and so the padding sounded like a good idea).  Also, the pockets that are created inside and out by surrounding the bag with a layer of fabric and stitching it at intervals are too shallow and baggy, which causes many tools on the longer side to flip out of them.  There are a few narrower pockets too, but they're so small that you're pretty much limited to a pen/pencil or a screwdriver.  I still like the bag overall, however - it looks good and seems to be pretty durable (I've only had it since around Christmas if I recall) -- if those two issues were fixed I'd give it a five-star rating.",3.0

"If you're wondering why people pay so much for variable speed grinders, then you don't you need a variable speed grinder. If you're not and you do, this one is great! Well built, solid feel, good balance, truly variable speed (harder to find than you might think, some ""variables"" are so hard to control you just end up running it at full speed all the time), perfect handle placement, solid guard. If it wasn't for that truly difficult to use on/off switch, five stars for sure. I'm not a Bosch junkie but this is one nice piece!

Update 9/10/11: I've had this a good while now and just spent four straight days with it, cutting and trimming some stone. Absolutely great grinder. However, the switch is damn awful! It turns off nicely, barely a touch, but getting this thing turned on is an absolute bitch. I'm cutting stone, right? As I go, I'm putting it on the wall with a high end, very caustic, thin set mortar. There's also metal lathe involved which you know if you've ever used it, is designed to scratch the heck out of your hands and forearms. So, I'm wearing nitrile gloves. The gloves, which I've reviewed elsewhere, are holding up fine. Sharp stone edges, really nasty mortar, excruciatingly sharp lathe, no problem. Granted, I'm being careful, but no problem. Guess where the gloves fail, every time? Right, the thumb, from turning on that pain in the butt switch!  This switch is so hard to operate I had to, every time, lay down the stone, grab the grinder handle with my left hand, then thumb the switch with my right hand, usually two or three times, then pick up the stone and trim. And when you're custom setting intricate pieces of stone, that means hundreds of extra steps.

Now Bosch's lawyers are reading this and going YAY! ... what could be safer than making this bozo use both hands to turn on the grinder and its only icing on the cake that he has to try two or three times .... that way we know he really wants to turn it on!!!!! Well, I've got a message for Bosch marketing people, you better stop letting the lawyers run the company ... if I had it to do again, I'd try another brand of variable speed grinder ... perfect in every way except for that stinking switch is not perfect enough for me. I've lowered the rating ... the more I use this thing, the more I think I could have chosen better.

Edit 11/12/13: Was using this last week to polish some smaller pieces of blue pearl granite. The work required holding the granite in one hand, this grinder in the other. As I manipulated the grinder to different positions, my hand kept sliding against the switch, causing the tool to shut off. Bitch! Then, I realized I needed to lock the switch down by pressing the rocker fully forward. Problem solved. On the other hand, it was only a problem to begin with because of a stupid switch design.",3.0
"Our company has owned other models of this Bosch grinder (1706E) for use in our masonry construction company. This 1803EVS grinder worked for a month or more then the on-off switch began getting tight. Now it has broken inside the grinder.

The demise of past Bosch grinder models seemed to be that when we used them to grind out mortar joints with a wide or a  sandwich blade it took too much horsepower for these machines and they quit.",3.0

"Homeowner - not a professional who would use these all of the time.

These work, but aren't he best design in the world.  When you jack up your system, make sure any shelving you rigged to these is attached somehow to keep it from sliding off.

Make sure you pull the ""wings"" over the jack system when you attach it, else the corners will dig into your columns when you lower.

The 2x4 safety bracing isn't the best design in the world either.  I had one refuse to move and snapped two screws holding the 2x4 until I ""assisted it"" with a ballpeen hammer.  They must have ran a lot of paint between the brace piece and the unit itself that held like epoxy (until the ballpeen unepoxied it).

Very pleased with the height the shelving is when it's attached to the jacks.

I have put off purchasing such an expensive blade for a long time, but I am completely satisfied with this blade, and feel it's money well spent. Time will tell just how long it will last, but from the other reviews I've read, it should be a good long time. Cutting real hardwood as opposed to composites will certainly help.

update 2-28-13

I mentioned in my review time will tell how long it will last. The answer in my case was about 400 cuts. I am now noticing some find chipping in molding finishes. I have cut nothing but hardwood molding (actually most molding is Luan), so pretty soft stuff. I tried to contact Forrest to inquire about blade sharpening, but got no response. I am now going to order a Quinn 100 tooth blade. They are considerably less money, and have a 107 year history.  Customer service seems to be top-notch. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent blade, but I do question whether it's worth the money, particularly after needing a sharpening after only 400 cuts. That's basically five cents a cut.

"I've bought a number of these over the years, so when I had a project that I needed long clamps for I bought a few more fixtures to go on the 10' pipes.  One of them worked flawlessly out of the package as expected.  On the other, I could barely tighten the clamp because the screw was dragging in the fixture.  It took about 20 minutes of tightening and loosening the screw while adding oil to get it to a tolerable state.  As I went through the process, little curly pieces of metal were being cut out of the cast iron by the treads of the screw.  I was essentially tapping the clamp so the threaded rod could spin freely.  In the end I got it to work fairly well, but it was not up to the standard of quality that I've come to expect from Pony over the years.  Since I ordered to fixtures and one worked flawlessly, I gave it five stars. Since I had to fix the other to get it to where it worked, I gave it one star for an average of three.

Consequently, top panels on mine were warped as much as 1/16"" out of flat, and panels were slightly different lengths - unacceptable. Also jaws did not close parallel inspite of my spending much time optimising the 2 thread rods synchronisation. So, a great design but flawed in its execution and quality.

"Bought mine from Ace Tool in Wantagh.  Look, if I spend $500 (plus add-ons) on a tool I expect absolute precision.  A router table is only as good as its weakest link, and in this case the weak link is the phenolic insert.  I spent a long time trying to get the plate flush with the table, time that was doubled after I discovered that the leveling changed after you locked down the screws.  I don't know if it's a function of the heavy Triton router, or if I have a defective plate, but after much fiddling the plate will not rest absolutely flush.  It's close, but in the middle of all four sides there is a hairline sag, which necessitates raising the corners slightly above on the outfeed side so that the workpiece will not catch when it transitions from the plate to the table.  And depending on the size workpiece and fence position, I have to make continual tiny adjustments.  I was skeptical of the phenolic insert for precisely this reason.  I'm going to see if I can fabricate an additional 4 under the table levelers that will sit in the center of each side -- failing that, maybe an aluminum insert plate or even returning the entire set up.

Everything else about the table is great, but given that the plate leveling is a critical engineering issue, and the reason why people are willing to spend more on a table, you would think Kreg would have figured this one out.

Update: So I manufactured some additional levelers out of hardwood and set screws to sit in the four midway points between the corner levelers.  It worked -- now the plate is absolutely flush.  If you take this route just make sure the pieces are small enough to allow clearance for your router.  But let me tell you about some additional wackiness I observed that makes my opinion of the system even worse.  The corner levelers are made of hardened plastic and have an inset threaded brass cylinder to house the screw that anchors the plate to the table (by way of the levelers).  I was aware of what other commenters have said about the dangers of over-tightening, so I used a low torque setting on my drill as I was tightening the screws.  But no -- the brass cylinders on two of the levelers came loose and literally popped out of the plastic as I tightened them.  I tried to pop them back in using pliers, but was unable to force them in -- so I had to drill the holes 1/64th bigger and then anchor them in with super glue.  I had just finished those repairs when the same thing happened on a third leveler.  I have not used the router since the fix, so I have no idea whether they will stay set through all the vibration.  Needless to say, going forward I will only hand tighten the plate screws with a screwdriver.  This is a frigging nightmare.  All that engineering and they can't be bothered to spend an extra dollar or two on manufacturing quality hardware?  This is definitely the last Kreg product I will buy.

Second Update:  So I just talked to Kreg and they were very cool and apologetic (thanks Ben!), and are sending me a new plate and inserts promptly.  Based on this interaction I've upped the stars from 2 to 3 and would consider buying other Kreg products again, as they seem committed to making things the right way, even if it takes a couple of trys.",3.0

"The 3 star rating is not meant to reflect the usefulness of the product or the accuracy of the work one can perform with it.  It is a reflection of the robustness of some key components.

The stand is very sturdy as is the laminate coated table top and the actual aluminium fence.  There are some weak areas.  The phenolic insert accepts either of 2 reducing rings.  These rings are held in place by screws which are threaded into very small, very fragile threaded holes in the phenolic insert.  It is extremely easy to strip the threads in the phenolic insert by over-tightening.  There is no positive ""stop"" when the screws are in far enough.  Exercise extreme care when installing the reducing rings.

More disappointingly, the aluminium assembly which attaches the fence to the levered glide (and the glide itself) which attaches to the guide on the side of the table are extremely fragile. The assembly is held to the levered glide by 4 machine screws with brass washers.  I stripped the threads in the aluminium parts tightening one of those screws, using a hand screwdriver gripped by my fingers only (i.e. I did not grab the screwdriver with a ""fist grip"").  I'm a lawyer and I am not noted for my death grip.  There are 2 nylon screws which take the slop out of the levered glide.  When I assembled my table one went in perfectly while the other cross-threaded as it entered the second piece of metal.

This is not the first tool I have had to assemble from a myriad of parts.  It is, however, one of the most fragile.

The fence is billed as being similar to a table saw fence.  In my view, that is a bit of marketing hyperbole.  The fence does have a locking lever at one end like a table saw fence.  Engaging the lever does not, however, lock the fence perpendicular to the side of the table.  There is a tall twist knob at the opposite end of the fence that you tighten after aligning the fence properly.  It certainly isn't a bad system, just not as effective as a table saw fence.",3.0

"I recently finished using the prazi beam cutter for a large timber arbor and gazebo. I was faced with the option of spending $4k on a Protool beam saw or buying a worm drive circular saw and a Prazi beam cutter for under $500. AS THE ADAGE GOES, ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."" It worked ok, but the cuts were not as accurate as I would have hoped for. Here is my list of areas they could improve on or points to be made:

One, the bar bounces around a lot when you begin to cut into a beam so you get sloppy cuts starting out.

Two, the chain would not stay tight. If they had used the same system that a conventional chain saw uses to tighten the bar it would be much better.

Three, it is not meant for ripping down a beam, it bounces and struggles the whole way.

Four, the rotation of a circular saw is counter clockwise which brings the sawdust up to the surface subsequently blocking the view of the line you are cutting on. THIS IS NO FAULT OF PRAZI, just a fact of adding on to a circular saw.

MY CONCLUSION:IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY FOR A PROTOOL BEAM CUTTER BUY IT! BUT IF YOU ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS BUY THE PRAZI AND GET USE TO TIGHTENING THE BAR EVERY 10-15 FEET OF CUTS AND DON'T EXPECT THE BEST CUT. OVER CUT AND THEN PLANE DOWN TO GET A SMOOTH EDGE.",3.0

"These are like having several pairs of hands holding and gripping work pieces while cutting, routing, sanding, using hand tools, etc.

There's really nothing as good out there in this price point.

That said, there are some cheap factors which are annoying.  This single hand clamping this is unnecessary and the flimsy plastic belt broke right away.

Don't put to much torque on the handles while snugging the table jaws together or you risk popping the interior assembly of the handles through the front.

Lastly, B&D should roll or round all metal parts on these tables.  I've been cut due to sharp edges which you cannot avoid making contact with during setup and break down.

So, all-in-all, a great table with some cheapy shortcuts.  Please be a little better than that.",3.0

"With this ""old is new again"" mentality I think people get a little caught up in nostalgia over true function.  If you think this hammer will be as comfortable, durable, or functional as a newer design with a modern handle you're crazy.  It looks great, sure.  It is balance nicely, yes.  But leather rings covered in lacquer can't compare to today's synthetic handles.  This hammer is slippery as a bar of soap when you have gloves on in the winter or start to develop sweat on your hands.  I have owned a few, some 40 years old from my father.  After a while the leather handle dry rots under the lacquer sometimes.  The few I've purchased new I have sanded off the lacquer completely and saturated the handle in leather conditioner which definitely helps.  But why, when I could have just purchased a dewalt, or fiskers, or newer estwing?........got caught up in the hype I guess.  If you are only looking for a solid, functional, hammer....look elsewhere.  If you feel like going through the same pains as your forefathers then this one's for you.",3.0
"I'm usually happy with anything that has Black & Decker's name on it -- not thrilled, but happy. The Workmate 425, however, has been a disappointment. The ""one-handed clamping system"" isn't quite up to B&D standards. The plastic belt slips frequently -- well, USUALLY -- requiring readjustment. And I've never achieved the solid clamping you get with a real bench vise; any activity that vibrates your work-piece (which is pretty much anything) usually results in slippage. And be careful when folding it up for storage -- the edges of the legs are sharp and my table has cut a couple of people. However, I think the thing that has been the most aggravating is that the dog holes just never seem to be where I need them. To achieve several configurations you can remove and rotate two of the three planks that make up the top. (Note to B&D: A guide illustrating the various configurations and their possible usages would be helpful.) With such a variety you might think you could find a configuration of dog holes for any need. But it seems they're always just a little bit off. Either that, or the mechanisms underneath the table prevent the dogs from being inserted all the way. I know I can drill my own and probably will, but with a little more thought the issue could have been avoided and this tool might have begun to live up to the B&D moniker.",3.0
I am building an ICF (insulated concrete form) house that calls for #4 and #5 rebar to be cut to size and bent around corners.  The description claims that this tool can cut and bend both sizes.  IT WORKS GREAT FOR CUTTING #4 REBAR!!!!  However the #5 rebar was nearly impossible to cut.  I actually hooked my winch up to the handle to create enough leverage to cut the #5 bar.  It bends both sizes with ease.  This is a good tool... although not quite as described.,3.0

"I am a weekend projects guy, so I thought something easy would do for me. I have to say that even though this product isn't that well built, it's a good idea. The wooden top is a bit bowed... warped... and the bolts that hold it together are screwed into the wood by friction. One of them doesn't grip the wood anymore so it just slides in and out. Needless to say, I'm going to re-cut the wooden top with blank sheets of MDF.

Also, the table, once it's folded, is a bit awkward to carry. The collapsing tabs are hard to find... it is still a good concept and great product. Just a bit unrefined and cheaply made. I would have gone for the 2.0 version, but alas it doesn't exist.",3.0
"The description is misleading. This does not work with Milwaukee 6 1/2"" circular saw (model 2730-20) because the measurement numbers will be upside down, and the guide is not in proper position. This is meant for saws with blades on the right (not left-side like my model). Also, you would not be able to use the guide with thinner material (like 1/4"" or smaller), because there is a big gap between the arm and the guide, which the material would slide through.",3.0

"These still look nice from about 5 feet.  As a mid-size claw hammer, it's fine.  The finish on the handle is a bit shiny, which could be a bit too slippery for some tastes and might benefit from some light sanding.  If you're buying an Estwing because it's pretty, be aware that the machining on the metal is somewhere below 'utilitarian', and much closer to 'atrocious.'

"So I really love this hammer but all the stickers leave this awful half peeled off look when you try and remove them.  Tonight I figured I'd use some alcohol and scrub them off; 25 minutes later it's mostly off.  For reference it took me about 5 minutes to get the stickers off a cheap harbor freight ball pien hammer.  Even once you get the sticker off this sticky, nasty residue just remains and moves around as you try to get it off.  I wanted to buy one as a gift for a friend but won't be.  If you intend this for a gift or like a quality look to your personal tools be prepared to carefully clean off the stickers (3 of them) as to not get any chemicals on the leather handle.  Better free up 25 minutes of your time too.  This is embarrassing for a $30 hammer; Estwing use easy peel labels and stickers to mark your merchandise!

However, ONE hole is enough to allow the drywall sanding dust to escape, clog the HEPA filter and generally make a mess inside the dust collection area.

Stanley planes use to be the benchmark everyone else tried to achieve, but now they mostly make ok planes. They are nowhere near the quality of my Lee Valley/ Veritas planes, or for that matter my selection of wooden planes. But they are a good toolbox plane.

You just need to make sure the center slotted strap goes on the correct way so that it doesn't jut out.

"I agree with the other raters on this saw.  I am a deck contractor and use it to cut 4x6 and 6x6 (takes two passes) posts.  The saw has LOTS of power and handles even wet pressure treated posts very well.

"The saw is very useful for remodeling, including for use in cutting openings for windows through studs.  Also it is great
for cutting 4x4's in one pass.  The shoe however is very flexible, made of sheet metal, and in fact came pre-bent.  I guess that was so I did not have to worry about bending it myself.  The result is a rounded and rather unstable base.
I suggest that Milwaukee redesign the shoe and get it up to the same level of quality as the rest of the saw.",3.0
"Needs quite a bit of work on the sole to get it nice and flat.  Bad hollow in the center and around the mouth.  With the low angle of the blade need to have the mouth opened almost all the way in order that the blade doesn't hit the front of the mouth. It's OK for the price, but not great.  Yes, you can spend a lot more money to get nicer planes, however, for the amount that I would use it, its good enough.  If you have a little more money to spend you can get the sweetheart versions with a much thicker blade and cuts much nicer and it won't need nearly as much work to flatten the sole and sides.",3.0
"This tool works perfectly fine and it cut some costs for me. I will say that this is not a safe answer to a taper jig as there is no easy way to clamp your piece to this.

"I purchased this item because of the good reviews and it suits my present needs.  Like I said in the title, it's made in china.  The handles on the vise portion are made of cheapish plastic with a fair amount of play once assembled.  The mechanism that connects the two handles together, so they operate simultaneously, is a thin belt of plastic with holes in it.  The wheels on the inside of the cranks are also made of plastic with little plastic cogs that are just waiting to break off. While attempting construction, I have already stretched some of the holes in the belt.  Putting the sliding table jaw on is a real bear, at least it was for me.  The tapped blocks on the rods with handles are a real pain to adjust because they're attached by the stupid plastic belt and are inside the table frame.  It took me about an hour and a half to assemble the darn thing and it's still out of whack about a 16th.  But it probably won't matter once I start using it because there's a fair amount of play anyways because the important parts are made out of plastic.  But, I will say that the frame itself is sturdy and I'm sure it will be a fine work table, albeit a bit low, look at the description...  I'm just not amused with the quality of the extras.",3.0
"I like the design, I have projects just begging to use it.  I'm a huge fan of B&D tools, they are a go-to brand for most things when I want quality.  this arrived, packaged well, contained all the pieces.  I love the sustainable bamboo wood used.  The engraved markings are superior to older models.  I look forward to using it.

Eventually using it, that is.

I'm currently not able to assemble this as I can't get the pins to go into the handles.  I wanted to alert people to this aspect of putting it together.  Look at the parts, get some long, thin cotter pins to replace the provided slit metal pins.  Lovely piece of design, if I had a multi-ton press to put this in to force it together.

So, what insanity has the hole in the metal rod at the center of the screws, that is to accept the pin to hold the handle on, closer to the frame than the plastic collars on the handle right angle pieces allow it to be for correct alignment?  Did anyone even TRY to put this together?  Seriously, as a swimmer and weight lifter, it isn't a lack of upper body strength to hammer this in, or press it in with a vise grip as a final attempt.  As someone with acute vision I can see the alignment is rotationally accurate, I can verify it with, say, a slender screwdriver.  Tight fit but if it is slender enough I can wiggle one in.  What my vision also confirms is the hole in the shaft is too close to the body of the frame.

I will now have to go get cotter pins to fix this.  I am summizing someone may have modified the crank body design  without actually confirming it would still fit.  Or, the hole making equipment was misadjusted on both these handles.  Maybe it would with enough pressure be able to be forced, but I can't do it.  Now the project I got this for is delayed while I head to the hardware store to try to find a replacement for the pins.

Now, to be complete here, I had one of the much older models long ago and liked it.  It eventually wore out after 25 years of use, so, I know the product will be usable for a long time, once I get it put together.

Thought it might prove useful to tell you all.  B&D, loose 2 stars for the pins.",3.0
"I like this workbench idea, but the quality of the material and build leave much to be desired.

The design is good but the production falls short. For instance all the boards on top are misaligned, as much as 1/4 inch. No way to fix that. The holes were drilled in the wrong places. Frankly, I don't see how that is possible given that they are drilled by a machine. Possibly it is because all three boards have been sawed to different length by as much as 1/4 inch. These sloppy tolerances are unacceptable. If Black & Decker would make their tools here in the United States in a union shop instead of China, these quality issues would not exist. But I digress.

Also the entire frame is out of square by about 3/8 of an inch. When you purchase a ""workbench"" of any sort, the least you expect is for it to be square. Also the vise clamps are cheaply made and low quality.

This is not a beef against Amazon, just BD.
In rewriting the manual I would have covered these topics (at least my bench arrived in one piece so thanks for that!)

What are the front blocks for and how do you use them? (Attach to front jaw just like the others. That way the work surface is level and you won't break the pinion pieces)

How does a human being drive the pins through the handles? (You can't, the pins are too big to press fit the steel shafts. I used cotter pins, works great.)

Why do the instructions tell us to pull the release levers with both hands and raise the bench with our other hand? (Who knows, the author must have an extra hand at the expense of mental capacity. If you wind the front jaw in as far as it will go, lift to vertical and put a foot on the stand you can just about manage it. Getting it down is a different manual feat.)

I still don't get how to angle the vise jaws to accommodate a 9 inch wedge. Do you have to disable the gratuitous plastic clutch belt? Please help, anyone!

"First off, woodworking is my hobby and not my profession, so I don't demand the finest of tools to pursue my pastime.  I was able to hone the iron pretty easily to achieve a decent cut on cherry end-grain.  The machined surfaces, however, were poor and had a lot of tool marks.  I don't believe you need a dead-flat sole for trimming end-grain, but something that isn't abrasive is certainly a plus.  Using a mill file and emory paper, I was able to remove MOST of the milling marks, but some were simply too deep.  The adjustable mouth worked, but was pretty sloppy.  Again, since this is my hobby, I don't make frequent adjustments to the mouth, so I can live with it.  So, if woodworking is your weekend hobby and you're on a budget, you can make this plane do what you need it to.  Don't buy it if you don't have the time and patience to tune it, or don't know how.  You will be disappointed.  Maybe one day I'll be able to afford high-end tools that are tuned when you buy them, or manufacturers will offer them at affordable prices.",3.0
"I have two workmates. I purchased the first about 25 years ago (and still have it). I purchased the second, the WM425 about a year ago thinking it would be the same, or at least close to the same unit.  But the construction is flimsier. The gauge of the metal is significantly reduced. The wood jaws are ""cheaper"" and the vise doesn't work as well.

I just bought a copy of Scott Landis' THE WORKBENCH BOOK, which has a final chapter on the Workmate and its inventor, Ron Hickman. The chapter includes pictures of the earliest version(s), which appear to be considerably sturdier than more recent models (including the one I purchased 25 years ago!).

My bottom line is that this is a well-designed product, but I'd pay twice the price to get a model that was better made.  This would be a how I would describe most Stanley Tools: by appealing to a mass market, quality suffers considerably. As my Mother used to say, ""You get what you pay for."" While the WM425 is a decent tool, it would be much better if it were sturdier and higher quality, with an expected price-point to match.",3.0
I can't really rate the replacement blade because instead of this I was sent the shark 10-2205 dovetail saw. The original had a pretty smooth cut. Now I'm just debating whether or not to go thru the hassle of returning or just keeping the dovetail saw.,3.0
"I have a original Black & Decker Workmate (purchased mid -1990's) that finally ""wore out.""  Could not replace wood top pieces.  Purchased the WM425.  It certainally has more fearures, but lacks strength and versality of old model.",3.0
"I received the product in the original package this afternoon with no damage evidenced from the transport. There was no damage to the frame or wooden jaws.

I expected to have a problem with the instructions after I read the reviews and was not disappointed. These directions without a doubt rank as the worst I have ever seen. Only after looking at the picture on the box and trial and error, I was able to assemble the unit in about 1 .5 hours. But most people will probably figure things out much faster than me. I am still not sure about the installation of the top jaws. I think that the unit is a fair value.

I believe the product will serve the purpose I need it for so was willing to put up with the fustration of the instructions and quality of the wooden panels. After all, it only cost around $120 dollars compared to the $500  Festool multipurpose table.",3.0
"Of course, Amazon shipping was perfect.
As other reviewers have stated, you buy this hammer because of the leather handle.  I have my 16 oz. from when I started building in 1975.
It seems that Estwing has listened to the complaints about the stickers ruining the handle - mine came with no stickers on the handle!  Yay!
Except that one of the rings of leather on the handle was flawed, but they just went ahead and lacquered it and shipped it anyway.  The gap in the leather was obvious, but passed Estwing's quality control nonetheless.
Should I send it back?  I'm not going to. I guess this is my time to give up hope for others' pursuit of quality... Made in USA... yay...whatever...",3.0

I'll keep it, but will buy another 225 model.",3.0
"The price of the replacement blade is too expensive.  The blade cuts quickly with little effort as it cuts on the pull stroke.  This saw is  excellent for flush cutting of molding, trim or dowels.  The coarse teeth  on one side of the blade cut aggresively even in white oak but I nicked a  hidden finish nail and with one stroke, the blade was completely ruined,  leaving only the fine cut side of the blade intact.  I'm reluctant to order  2 replacement handles because I guestion the longevity of the saw's plastic  handle.",3.0
"I've had this block plane for about a year now, and I think 3 stars is fair. Keep in mind that the blade isn't sharp out of the package. In my opinion it's just roughed in. The back of the blade isn't perfectly flat, and the edge isn't honed. If you flatten the back and hone the edge the blade is decent, and the blade holds an acceptable edge. The sole of the plane will most likely require flattening. There are tons of resources online on how to properly tune a block plane and I suggest you take advantage of those resources if you purchase this plane. In my opinion it's a great value if you understand what you're getting, and you're willing to take the time to tune it up a bit. This is a great plane for the money, and a good value but don't expect it to perform the same as a Lie Nielsen or a Veritas out of the box. If you just want a low-angle block plane for general carpentry use and you're willing to spend a couple hours dialing it in, this is a way better value than the more expensive options. If you're a serious woodworker doing fine work, and you're willing to spend the money, you will probably be more satisfied if you spend the extra money. Keep in mind that this plane is not nearly as high of quality as Stanley products of yesteryear.",3.0
"This is a good starter block plane. I find that I use this low angle plane more than my standard angle block plane. However, the cap iron locking lever is easily disturbed and requires careful handling.  I will trade-up to a better model in the near future. Other than that, once the blade is sharpened properly and machined surfaces are true, it does a fine job.",3.0
I recommend a good product.,3.0
"It's ""OK"", and beats using a pair of horses with an old door on top. But that's about it. I was surprised to see that the ""chain"" used for the vise hand cranks was perforated vinyl tape. That being said, you can't grip anything real tight, because the sprockets will slip in the holes.
If you are over 5' tall, the optional leg extensions are a necessity. Without using them, you'll end up with a major back ache from bending so low.",3.0
"The hammer itself is self is great and the handle is more comfortable then the 'rubber' estwing I have. The low star rating is two fold. One Amazon put a control sticker with near permanent glue on the handle which took quite a while to remove the glue residue it left behind. The handle is the sole purpose you get this hammer over other Estwings and that is a catastrophically bad place to put a sticker like putting a pin through a rain jacket.

The other complaint is the stickers used by Estwing were in equally stupid places with equally strong glues (The Estwing stickers I got were not lined up properly... flapping in the breeze and suffered from the chemicals I used to remove the glue from the handle but I would have normally left them on. ).

I know it is a hammer it is gonna get dirty and beat up but the glue left over was strong enough to nearly hold the hammer against gravity to my hand.  That is not something I want or need near my tool belt or other tools. That stuff  is just going to get gritty and nasty is no time and get all over everything else. I don't like buying a new items and then needing to clean it for 20 minutes before I can use it.

I would suggest using those easy to remove stickers on the hammer for packaging and labeling.",3.0
"Estwing makes a good hammer and they are made in the USA.  Just don't buy it from Amazon.  I bought and returned 4 hammers, then kept a 5th that were all the wrong model from what i ordered.  I feel like that many chances is more than fair and Amazon usually does an ok job, but apparently Estwing makes far too many variations that are too similar for Amazon to fulfill an order correctly.  I'm giving it 3 stars to split the difference of a 5 star hammer at a 1 star place to order it from.",3.0
"Recently purchased one of these hoping to use for several simple home projects, (and regrip my golf clubs too)

Despite all the warnings to the contrary, ordered it from Amazon and yes, it did arrive with some minor damage

The illiterate, unintelligible ""assembly instructions"" were a challenge - not only for me but also for B&D phone support - who had to keep me on hold for 10 minutes while they clarified the 2nd and 3rd instructions

For instance - the ""jaws"" (the three boards that comprise the top of the workbench) are attached to the bench frame by an unusual mechanism, that is only vaguely referenced in the instructions

Once past that, it seems to be very versatile and easy to use - but don't hope for any instructions from B&D - trial and error will serve you better",3.0

Small things like the machining is not quite as polished, and the paint seems  heavily applied, but not in a good way.

"I had one of these since when they first came out in my area. That was maybe about 16 years ago. I was looking on Amazon for table saw accessories and saw this one for only $69 with free shipping, so I bought it thinking it would be nice to have an extra one on hand.

The first one never made it and got destroyed in transit. The second one arrived a few days later. The box was also torn and the box open, but everything was there.

Boy they sure make these cheap compared to the way they used to make them. I don't think this could be made any cheaper. I also don't think the clamping feature works as well as the original version. The linking of the clamping screws with a plastic belt actually makes it less effective as a clamping tool.

I think the $69 price I paid is about right, but I know i wouldn't pay the $89 that it is now listed for. Why anyone would pay full price for this (listed @ ~$180) is beyond me. It is described as being able to hold 550 lbs, but I wouldn't ever load it with that much weight. I think it would collapse. I think for using it as a basic sawhorse for cutting wood with a circular saw or by hand or for using it as a portable stand for tools is about as far as I would stress it. So I probably wouldn't put more than 50 lbs on it.

As long as you know what you are getting and you find a good price for it, I think you will be happy with it, but if you had the original, you may be disappointed in the lack of quality in this version.",3.0
"This bench is an ideal addition to any workshop, basement, shed, etc.  It folds up nice and compact, and serves as a great place for quick set ups and light clamping.

The 90 degree clamping feature is handy, though very limited.  It can really only clamp narrow objects, since the rails get in the way and there's only about 1"" of clamping surface.  Being able to move two of the top sections is certainly a plus, though the plastic securing pegs seem like they'll eventually break.

In comparison to my old 79-001 ""Deluxe Dual Height"" Workmate that belonged to my father and is now mine, the clamping deck doesn't have nearly as much opening/closing travel, the parts are mostly cheap plastic, and it doesn't have stiffening boards to keep the top flat.  Two of the three decks on mine are bowed, and it's never been used for anything heavy or has been hammered on.

I rarely use the orange deck clamps and they often get misplaced.  A storage spot would be nice to keep them from getting lost, though I'm sure B&D doesn't mind selling replacements :)  There are two holes in the step area that look like they might hold them, but they're a tad too small and the pegs get jammed up if you try to store them there (I found that out the hard way)",3.0
"Back in the mid-80's I bought my first set of Trojan saw horses. An advertisement back then showed multiple units of lumber sitting safely on top of two horses. I had to have them!  Since then I've bought every Trojan product I've seen and loved them all. I've had my MS-2000 since Nov 2001 and have loved it dearly until last week. That's when, while moving the set-up stand (with saw attached), a weld broke and the entire stand collapsed- saw and all. I couldn't believe my eyes as it was happening!! It was like watching a house of cards tumble down. My Makita miter saw appears to have suffered little damage, but the wall it collapsed into was not so lucky.

Upon inspection it was immediately apparent that the weld was a failure. A beautiful coat of paint obscured the fact that a main cross piece was in fact only superficially attached to a vertical leg by the failed weld. Because the stand stresses the legs and other components when it's legs are locked in place, when the weld broke it subjected many components to stress bending, and some of those are now ruined or will require removal from the stand and other componentry to straighten them. I'm quite discouraged by the whole thing. I'm not sure if a person could have seen that the weld was going to fail before it did, and indeed the other side of that same cross piece looks like it's welded well to the other leg, but it certainly leaves me with much less confidence that Trojan products are everything I've always held them up to be.",3.0

I have had one of these units for several years and they are handy and don't take up much space when folded up.  The problem that I have had is that there is a plastic latching mechanism that holds the lower legs in place when it's in the folded position and also when it's in the unfolded position.  Over time each of these 4 plastic pieces broke one by one.  The unit can still be used but it is a pain in the rear trying to get all the legs in the right position to stand up -- on the level or fold up and stay folded up.  I'm looking for something with the same capability without this feature which is common to three or four of the workmate models.,3.0

"You get what you pay for.  I didn't bother flattening the sole of this little block plane....what's the point, after all its a block plane!  If it were a jointer, or even a jack, it would be worth doing, but anyway...  The blade needs work.  The bevel was not uniform, the back not flat or polished.  As you might guess, the edge was marginal at best.  Took about an hour to fix the edge with diamond and ceramic stones by hand lapping.  NOW its sharp!  I don't know how long it will hold an edge.  Other minor gripes are that the mouth adjustment started out very stiff (worked that back and forth to loosen it up) and the blade advance screw is also too tight when the cap iron is clamped on.  Maybe it will loosen up with use.  In short, this is not a plane that is ready to use out of the box, but for the price, once you get it tuned, it looks like it will do just fine.",3.0

Every whack it goes ""poiiiing"", and drives me batty.  I just replaced the nice new shiny non marring non bending Estwing with my old trusty Stanley that bends nails all the time, just because I couldn't handle the tuning fork noise.

"Go to the OSHA web site and see their briefing on what to do and not to do.  Amazon edited out the URL.

Pump jacks use 2 2x4 nailed together with the seam perpendicular to the house when upright.  2x4 joints should have a reinforcing plate.  Base should be fixed (see pole anchors).  Top is secured by a brace screwed to the wall or roof.  So, you have to set a ladder to set the poles.

Need guardrails.

Walk boards should secured and overlap 6 inches on either end.  Walk boards should be off the wall no more than 14 inches.  Anything over 10 feet 'requires' a fall arrest system.

The reality is that wood pump jack poles have very poor lateral strength.  I picked mine up off the ground and it snapped in two.  If I ever was crazy enough to do pump jacks again, I'd try a wood-plywood-wood sandwich to stiffen them up.

I also tried microlam poles which were dramatically stronger, but they were too hard for the jack to grip.  Might be possible to face the microlam pole with wood. You'd have to experiment.

Aluminun pump jack systems are much stronger and more expensive.

Unless I mis-read the instructions, which is always possible (doubtful, but possible) the spring angle has to be re-entered each and every time prior to making a corner angle measurement. Considering that an entire run of crown will have the same spring angle, the simple act of resetting the spring angle at each and every corner makes using my Starrett dial protractor & chart faster.

Considering the otherwise OUTSTANDING quality of the tool, I was very disappointed at this and the fact that it will not 'miter split' a corner without a spring angle.

"I bought a Coleman Cable extension from Amazon (their 125V, 50 foot, 10 ga wire - basically this same cable with a 125 volt rating instead of 300 volts) - I bought it because I wanted a good brand name and not some made-in-china extension from the hardware store that was called #10 AWG but really was #14 from the feel of it.  Coleman Cable has a good name, and makes good wire, but this cable is rated for 300V, yet only has a 115 volt plug on it, meaning you are paying for insulation class you most likely will never use since there aren't any legal 240V -> 115V adapters manufactured!

If you look at what people bought, you will find that coleman cable makes a wide range of diameter and length as well as the 300volt and 125 volt ratings.  I DEFINITELY recommend buying the #10 ga. cable - voltage drop is minimized in long runs by the heavy wire.  I settled on the 50 foot 10ga. as a main run cable with a 20A power tap to split off from there.  You are allowed to run 20A on 10Ga by NEC, and many #10 extensions will have the sideways plug on them already so they can only be used with a 20A outlet, however these are not always found so the ""normal"" 115V, 15A ""vertical"" design that coleman put on this cable makes it usable everywhere - another good reason to go with it.  So long as you stick to 10 Ga, and you have a 20A breaker with a dedicated outlet, you can easily adapt to 20A appliances downstream from the cable with homemade adapters.

Again, I picked 50 feet because I did not want to suffer the double loss in a 100 foot cord.  Realistically you are probably better off with 2 50 foot cords than a single 100 as you can adapt them when you need a long run to the pole or use them separately.

Don't put 240 volts on this cable - although it is clearly rated for it someone downstream is in for a real surprise when they get 240 out of a jack meant for 115V.  This is why I opted to choose the 115 volt version listed above as an alternative.

No matter which cable you buy from Coleman you will be satisfied with the construction quality and longevity of the cable with low voltage drop starting heavy motors (compressors and saws are the worst but still work at the end of 50' of #10)",3.0
"This product does NOT, I repeat, does not give you an accurate reading--at least not for 90-degrees, anyway. I own the most squared stainless steel square ever built. It is the same square I use to establish set angles on my table saws and other tools. When lining the DWM against it, the DWN falls short. Nothing monumental--we're talking fractions of a degree, nonetheless... take it for what it's worth.
The product appears to be durable and the programmable angle calculations are anon and accurate. But... is this product actually worth the price? Absolutely not. And here's why.

The manufacturer lists accessories for this angle finder. One of the most important ones is the extension. That extension should NOT be an accessory; it should be included in the price because 3 out of 5 angles I measure do not have long enough bases to rest the tool on. Hence, the extension. Are you reading this, Bosch? Stop being so cheap!
Further, the case is extra as well. I mean, come on! Nearly every tool that is sold on the market comes with its own case. What makes this product any different? Oh, I know... capitalism. Yes, it's certainly well constructed and definitely not meant to be banged around. So why not include the carrying case with it? Make the extension and the carrying case part of the package, then, YES... the price would be worth it.
One more con. I cannot believe the engineers of the DWM opted not to place an angle lock on this device. I really can't. If you're using this product to measure, let's say, several measurements containing the same angle, God forbid you accidentally bang it, or bang the tool into the wood, etc. You'll instantly lose the angle. It's not as feeble as you may assume upon reading this; nonetheless, it will indeed move with the slightest nudge.

"Like the other reviewer, I bought this to use with my toro powercurve snowblower.  It worked fine except the female end of the extension cord never fit properly with the toro's male connector.  The connector blocks are entirely molded which seems to be a good idea for water/weatherproofing, but it was just too big.  I had to jam them together and it frequently disconnected.  (I was using the toro's cord lock system properly).

Anyway, I tried it out this fall with a toro electric vac/blower, and had the same problem, only this time I ended up with some melted plastic and some really nasty smelling smoke.  It turns out that the connectors inside the female end of this cord are placed very far back into the molded block and there was very little surface area of actual plug contact, which led to the problem.  (I was using the cord lock correctly with this one, too).

It could just be an issue with toro electric power tools but just be aware.  Other than that, seemed to be a pretty decent cord - didn't kink a lot and I ran over it a couple of times with the snowblower and I'm still here writing this, so it's fairly tough as well...  Can't give it more than 3 stars because of the odd female plug design.",3.0

"This tool is so close to perfect I wonder why they didn't just go ahead and make it perfect.  For instance, why do I have to reset the spring angle every single time.  Why are there not presets and the ability to keep the spring angle in memory?  So simple.  The lack of these features makes this tool more cumbersome than it needs to be.  Otherwise I love it.  I may return it though because it is just enough of an irritant to me that these features were not incorporated into this tool.",3.0
"Bosch tools are made - mechanically and structurally - well and the angle finder is no exception.  However, its utility is lacking.  It is large and bulky.  If you have a bulkhead or soffit that has a depth less than the length of one of the arms of the angle finder then you can't determine an angle with it.  The one arm surface will rest on the soffit surface (with its end cap butted to the wall) and extend beyond the surface where you would normally swivel the other arm flush.  The variable input method is also lacking.  It would be great if you could store variables - i.e., spring angle.  For someone who does not like to cope or finds the tool useful for tasks other than crown/trim installation then maybe it has its benefits.  I would not say this is a workshop must.  It's a pretty cool conversation piece in the though.",3.0

"There is a Worm Drive cult in the carpentry world. Grown men act like babbling little boys running for the ice cream truck whenever they hear the words ""worm drive"". There's no doubt that they are fine saws, and powerful, but take a deep breath. I can due virtually anything a worm drive can do with my little 10.5 Amp makita circular saw... except convert it to a 10-1/4 Circular saw.

However, who really needs 10-1/4? If you are going to be cutting green 4x4's, this saw will not cut through them. This saw will only cut through a ""nominal"" 4x4. So... if you want to build that log cabin or timber frame out of true 4x4's, this saw won't help you. Or, if you want to gang cut a stick framed house, this saw won't help you. You'll need at least 5-1/2 inches to gang cut the modern stick framed house. I suspect that when this conversion kit was invented, 2x4 walls were code. In those days, this saw could gang cut your studs, but no longer, unless you're not building to code.

If you want to cut through doubled plates, then an 8-1/4 inch saw will do the same for a fraction of the cost and far less weight. Makita's new 5008MGA, Magnesium 8-1/4 Inch SideWinder cuts 3 inches deep, 3/4 of an inch less than the Big Foot for twice the price. (As of writing this, Amazon still isn't selling the saw. It's relatively new.)

If you just have to have a 10-1/4 saw, then I would probably choose the Big Foot over the Makita 5201NA 10-1/4-Inch Circular Saw. I too can't resist the siren call of the worm-driven saw, even if it's going to cost me $50 dollars more.

However, if you *really* want a saw that cut's everything, the Makita 5402A or 5402NA is the saw you want. This circular saw really will cut just about all your beams in one pass and will gang cut a modern stick framed wall. The only saw that competes with it might be the Big Foot 14 Inch Circular Saw. I own the Makita. I've used the Big Foot 14 incher. The advantage of the Big Foot is that it weighs half as much as the Makita. The Makita cuts 6-1/4 inches deep, the Big Foot 14 cuts 5-3/4 inches deep.

The Makita costs less.

The Big Foot 14 inch saw looks cooler.

"Although the overall quality of this product is good, the Hitachi customer service regarding the warranty stinks.  The pressure reducer knob broke off after only 11 months of minimal use.  The local Hitachi service center is more of a drop off location and is telling me the part is a wear part so is not covered under warranty.  Hitachi wants me to ship the compressor from AZ to GA for them to look at.  So in order to replace a $30 (or less) part, they want me to ship a 60 lb product across the country twice.  This makes absolutely no sense to me except that this way they avoid having to perform warranty work on their product.  Really bad customer service.",3.0
"Has to run alot because of the small tanks but does a fairly good job of keeping sufficient PSI to work with (assuming you don't need to high a PSI).  Running on a 25 foot, 14 guage commercial extention, compressor often trips the circuit breaker.  Can't imagine the problem you would have with a normal 16 guage extention.  Runs fine if plugged directly into an outlet but that is not always convenient.  Longer hoses will help.  After only about 6 to 8 hours of use, I turned it on and it made such a racket I was afraid to reach for the power switch.  Pulled the plug from the outlet and found the nut holding the circuit breaker had vibrated off and the circuit breaker had fallen back into the case where it sheered almost every blade on the cheap plastic fan.  Didn't hurt the circuit breaker so that it is plus.  Fan is ""pressed"" on so not as easy a fix.  Called Hitachi and they wanted me to send it to them to look at.  Wasn't cost effective to send a sixty pound compressor to the company for a 7 dollar part (not 7 dollars from Hitachi but available online).  Hitachi probably needs to do a recall on this issue but doubt that happens.  Runs loud but most compressors do - not much worse than the average.  Bottom line is I paid more for what I thought was a quality product with a quality manufacturer - I've reconsidered that decision.",3.0

"Okay, as you may have noticed in other reviews, it seems that it is not possible to ship an air compressor without damaging it.  I would say that is true.  I got one of these from Amazon in May and it looked like it had been through a war.  The handle was bent, the regulator was snapped off, and little parts were everywhere in the box.  To Amazon's credit, a new one was on the way immediately after I reported it.  I got the second one and it seemed to be okay.  My project got delayed for 3 months, so I didn't use it.  Once I started using it, it developed a strange noise 2 weeks into the job.  The whole base of the compressor was shattered and falling apart.  Whether this was damaged in shipment or if it developed on its own, I will never know.  Being over 90 days old, Amazon's policy is to take it up with the manufactureer.  I am still waiting to hear from them.  When I was using it, It seemed to power up quickly and keep up well.  I just wish I had more in service time with it to tell for sure.",3.0

"I've been a professional woodworker for 20+ years and have owned several small compressors. I have yet to find one that lasts indefinately either due to malfuntioning or being stolen from job sites. Therefore I'm reluctant to purchase anything expensive. This unit however has so far proven to be a quiet and reasonably reliable for over 2 years. For the current asking price of $200 and change, I consider it to be a good buy. The list price of $600+ is a joke but wouldn't be all that far out of line if it didn't come with the flaws in the controls that turn up eventually in all light duty compressors in the $200-$300 price range. It's likely that if you plan on running it all day to feed multiple framing nailers, you might be better off purchasing something more expensive, installing a GPS locator chip for when it disappears or chaining it to your truck while being guarded by a junk yard dog. Using a light duty unit like this to feed tools like air sanders or paint guns would fry even larger, inexpensive, medium duty compressors after a realtively short time.",3.0
"This is just a simple instrument used for the establishment of elevations only. You can't, or shouldn't try, to turn angles or lay out building lines with it. This is not a transit, the sight tube does not tilt, and no degree markings are on the base plate. That said, the level itself is all metal and is pretty hefty and solidly built. The design seems a bit crude with the vial hanging exposed and unprotected beneath the sight tube and held by two spring loaded set screws.
Out of the box, the instrument was out of adjustment. The bubble vial was not parallel to the sight tube and would always swing to the eyepiece side when rotated 180 degrees.
Berger included instructions for correcting this, but the wrench to adjust the setscrew was missing from my kit. It takes a 7/64"" allen wrench, which luckily I had.

"I bought this hammer from the big box chain, and now realize I did not get a top notch deal.  However, the hammer does exactly what it is supposed to do, drive nails all day.

Every whack it goes ""poiiiing"", and drives me batty.  I just replaced the nice new shiny non marring non bending Estwing with my old trusty Stanley that bends nails all the time, just because I couldn't handle the tuning fork noise.  I tried winding electrical tape on the handle, the stem or whatever and could not get rid of the noise.  I know it is kind of ""soft"" to complain of noise of a hammer, but this is just too much.

Finally, this is a stack where all the chippers are the same size and you rely a lot on spacers and shims.  I find stacks where the chippers measure different widths easier to deal with.

The steel in Japanese is unique and it stay sharper and cuts smoother.  Japanese saw are easier to control and the Handles are amazing.  They are much more expensive but I guarantee i can cut 2-3 times faster and neater than you can with this saw.  There is little to no effort and the saw does the work.  I used a new Japanese saw to cut a Rock maple cabinet down so that it could be modified for a TV stand.  I put a nice piece of granite on top when done.

"I recently purchased this table for use in my home shop.  My past experience with Rousseau products suggests that it will perform well.  The set up instructions for it, however, are woefully inadequate.  They are so poor that 3 stars is generous.  They still contain instructions for the obsolete model 2700D, which was the table made for this older, smaller job site saw, and the general instructions for saws other than the ones this table is designed for are very poor.  For those of you with the older, smaller Makita 2708, here's how to make the set up easier and less frustrating.  (1) Cut three spacers: one 1""x28"" to go in front of the saw (you need some space so the fence will work); one 5-7/8"" x28 to go at the back of the saw; and one ""x21 to go between the saw table and laminate top.  These will lock the saw in place. You might want to put a clamp on the remaining edge for good measure, but it isn't necessary.  With the saw locked in place you can see which holes will work best with those nylon locking cams, inventions from hell if ever there were any.  I'm not sure I trust the cams not to slip, but that remains to be seen.  It would be an easy matter to use the spacers all the time, or even permanently attach them.

Using spacers to position the saw while you try to set and tighten those maddening nylon cams will cut your setup time in half, but I would still do it out of earshot of the wife and kiddies.  You could also vary the width of the front and back spacers.  If the front one is a bit wider you will have enough room to adjust the set screws on the fence without taking it off for trial and error.  Those set screws are 4mm.",3.0
"This is the least expensive 8"" carbide stacked dado that I could find. I bought mine at a big-box store about a year ago. It replaced a 6"" steel stacked set that I bought a few years back. It was a big step up and, for a while I was satisfied with it despite the not-quite-flat bottom it left.

Last week I needed to rabbet some pine molding. I didn't have a close look at the dado while I installed it on the arbor. Upon starting the cut, the workpiece vibrated violently as it passed into the dado. I stopped and examined the dado and discovered that the outboard blades were missing a total of six teeth. I'm not sure when I lost the them, but the net result is that I'm now looking for a new dado set as I don't feel like investing $40 or $50 to have the teeth replaced.

This is easy to do since they look the same and are not marked.  The blades embedded in the hardwood and the rest is history.  Though parts are available there were so many damaged teeth it's just not worth replacing them.  I just ordered a set from a company whose name is commonly assoicated with a big bear.

So I nailed a lot of plywood and 1 by 6s, driving probably 200,000 nails. With the fork-lift traffic, hoses and cords were out of the question.

It sometimes will move the stud that I am trying to nail because I have to press so hard to actuate the thing.

I own this gun and the Paslode angled finish nailer.  The finish nailer is one of the best tools ever invented, the framing nailer leaves a bit to be desired for commercial work.

On the upside, it seems to be very durable, and I'm happy with the performance of the batteries and the fuel cells.  It just doesn't have the power, speed or finesse of a regular nailer.  Portability is its main feature.

"I have had my eye on this thing for a while, however, before deciding to purchase, I rented from Home Depot to tackle a medium size deck project.  I after using this impulse framing nailer all weekend, I am a bit torn.  When it is working well, it is a dream.  Other times, it can be downright frustrating.  (In defense of Paslode, it is not recommended for use on 2"" pressure treated lumber and that is exactly what I was using)

#1 it is heavy to be using all day everyday

#2 the nail capacity of 1 strip seems like a very small amount

3# Capacity of each gas cartridge is amazing!!!

#4 Use Paslode nails for reliability, but they are $$$

#5 Can only shoot about 3-4 shots before need to refil combustion chamber with fuel, about 10 seconds, not a big deal for a DIYer but bad for a professional.

#6 For $400 should include a no-mar tip!!

#7 Body is all plastic construction, which makes it seem a bit cheap

#8 Nice case for unit, battery and charger, plus stoage for a couple of gas cylinders.

#9 NO COMPRESSOR TO LUG AROUND OR HOSES TO GET CAUGHT",3.0
"too thick and heavy . I wanted a 1/4"" Inside diameter (3/8"" outside) bought this accidentally.

this is a great nailer but its very very tempermental if its used every day it must be cleand evry day and thats very time comsumeing but still better then draging out a comperssor and hoses so over all good gun,3.0
"I managed to talk my boss into buying a paslode when I was doing my apprenticship back then they were the old black model, it gave us so much trouble that we resorted back to the compressor powered gun. Well, many years on and I have started my own carpentry business and thought nothing of forking out for the ""new improved"" orange gun. So far I have found it to be an unreliable piece of kit that doesnt want to work in dampish conditions, and after a few seasons work has decided to start chewing up the main ""O"" ring just above the fan, now I will admit that I use between 5 and 10000 nails per week but she is cleaned twice a week and well looked after, I have traced the O ring trouble to the chamber that connects with the ring each time the element is depressed, and have found that it developed a burr on the edge which needed filing out. That seems to have cured that problem but it has now started misfiring, for some strange reason the tongue that pushes the nail into the timber is managing to slide past the nail although the nail is in the prime position.
My verdict: good for light infrequent use, but just not up to real trade strength, sorry paslode but you need to lift the standard in order for me to buy another, I just hope dewalt come out with a similar design at least then I know it won't let me down.",3.0
"1. The concept is great !
 2. I have used 3 different units that were each new to like new and found a lot of miss fires on two of them even with oem nails . I tried single strips and double strips to no avail.
 3. The unit that did function was good for about 5 out of 8 nails fired.
 4. It will not drive into treated wood fully ( 1/4 "" protrusions were common .
 5. a tooless drive depth adjustment would help in time consumption ,( in soft spruce and similar woods it countersunk well ).
 6. you cant bump fire and you must depress then wait for the fan to engauge before firing ( too slow ).
 7. don't buy one , rent it .",3.0

"We've used Paslode Impulse Nailers for our framing crew since they first came out.  We still have some of our first guns, from nearly ten years ago.  Our crew is not easy on tools, so the tools have not been babied.  The  newer guns are not as good and the service sometimes leaves a lot to be  desired.  When I have complained to the reps I'm told that the tool is not  for everyday framing, just for occasional use where pnuematic tools are  inconvienent.  This is what the retailers don't tell you when you buy them.  They are not supposed to be a primary tool -- but that's how we use them  anyway.  We've learned to implement most repairs and cleaning on the job.  It would be nice if Paslode would make the guns so they SHOULD be the  primary tool.",3.0

"The bag is made of heavy rip-stop nylon that will probably outlast me.  I don't use this professionally, but I always have a lot of projects in my ""off"" hours.  The bag has many nice pockets (though I don't find them very useful in practice) and a sturdy zipper.

The big downside is that there is no stiff bottom in this bag, unlike every other bag I've used.  Tools all slump to a heap in the center.  I'll cut my own, but I shouldn't have to.  A minor complaint is that the handle is just a nylon strap.  I much prefer the feel of the nylon straps on the 'Ridgid' brand bags which have a stiff cord in the strap.

"I really purchased this Bucket Boss GateMouth Jr. for a friend who actually carries his tools around in a canvas shopping bag.  Yes, he does.  But I see this GateMouth Jr almost every day so I feel confident to comment on it.  First of all, it has allowed said friend to organize his tools and actually know where his tools are when he needs them.  This because of the various pouches.  The bag seems well made and stands up to normal abuse on a small job.  I think the larger GateMouth would have been a better choice because more than one cordless tool can crowd things too much in this Jr version.  Also, we both agree that an open mouth bag, or tote, would have been more convenient because of it's capacity.  This GateMouth Jr has strong seams, helps you organize your tools as long as you're not carrying anything too large and it doesn't seem that any sharp object is going to poke through it - time will tell on that.  It's a little small, but if that's all you require then this is a nice little item for transporting your tools.
___________________

It's a couple of months since the above post.  I just want to mention that the bag itself is holding up well in it's construction, but it's developed a sag in the bottom.  This is probably because an 18 volt cordless drill is often carried in the bag.  My friend cut a piece of 1/8"" stock to fit on the bottom of the bag and this helps.  He rounded the corners of the insert and this should prevent any rips.  Time will tell.  Still valid comments above, but we both wish the bag had come with a rigid bottom.  The description didn't mention this, so I guess we should have known.  The sag presented the problems you would imagine.  The insert helps.  Just to pass this bit of information along.  I'm using a Workforce tote which I much prefer.",3.0
"Build quality of this bag is excellent and it is fairly light-weight. However, the design seems inherently flawed. If you load up the tool pockets lining the inside of the bag, the weight of these tools tends to pull the bag closed, making it difficult to reach for a tool one-handed, and about impossible to efficiently place tools back into the pouches, so I never end up bothering and pretty much use this as a cluttered tool sack.  I just replaced it with a more rigid nylon tool bag.",3.0

"I like this hose. It is plenty long enough to get anywhere around the garage you need and it's flexible enough to not make you angry upon rolling it up to put it away. My gripe and reason for not rating it higher is that upon screwing an attachment on to the end of it the fitting that things get screwed onto ripped a tiny bit, just enough to leak some air. This was mostly operator error as I initially didn't hold the hose end with a wrench while screwing something to it but it ripped a bit easier than I think it should have. It's nothing a bit of electrical tape couldn't cure but it's worth a ding on the rating.",3.0

"We bought a Fixer-upper, my wife and I, and as a recently retired residential designer, I returned to my earliest occupation-- arough carpenter. A lot has changed since the 70's I still had my 20 oz hammer but I was dismayed at how those little muscle skills had disappeared so I bought a little job site compressor, a package of nail guns and a package that included some brass fittings, a tire inflator, tire pressure guage and a blower and a 25 foot 1/4 inch diameter plastic hose. The hose was an accident waiting to happen as its coils rolled unpredictably around.

Now, I worked in gas stations right out of High School and we had a variety of impact wrenches and Tire Man units powered by compressed air; the hoses were always rubber, they were stood up well to abuse and they laid flat and remained flexible when cool (really cold made them a bit harder to manage). I knew there was better available.

That is what I wanted. That is what this product is -- it just a different color (used to be orange) and I got 50 feet so my little pancake compressor can be on the back porch while I am inside, working, and when it starts up, it frightens the neighbors pets, not mine.

Amazon delivered on time at a decent price and I am content.",3.0

"I'm not a ""professional"" contractor, but I am ""handy"" and have no problem taking on larger DIY projects on my farm.

I have been looking for a solid metal level as part of my ""Go To"" tools I keep in my bags.  To be fair, this level *does* have many nice features - the strong magnets (mentioned in many reviews) being one of them.  The cut-outs in the billet are also generally well done achieving good visibility for checking the vials when nailing/screwing off at odd angles.  I would prefer a slightly larger profile for better hand-fit.  While the slimness is not ideal, I don't think I would qualify it as a flaw.  Presumably, other users would find the same slimness a benefit.

The real negative, in my view, is that the bubbles are simply too small, leaving a large gaps on either side of the vial marks.  It's true that to the experienced tradesman, the bubble's position can be ""eye-balled"" to center between the vial marks - and I've been using this technique for as long as I've owned this tool.  However, the whole point of owning a measurement tool is to be able to accurately MEASURE something.  That is, I want the gap between the edge of the bubble meniscus and the line to be as small as possible while still being quickly readable.  If I have to *estimate* the center position of the bubble, it defeats the whole point of using the tool to find the level position quickly and accurately.  With the existing bubble-to-line gap, it's easy to get variance of 1/4"" or more over 10', even taking care to eye-ball center-bubble position.

While the level IS usable, and with nice features, I don't think it fulfills it's primary function of ""level"" very well.  It's certainly not a $30+ measurement tool.",3.0

Compared to many other products out there from different companies this thing is amazing and much cheaper but I'm not going to compare it to other products I have seen.  Lighting is very good and is a bright white and slightly blue.  The magnifier is nice but came with lots of greasy finger prints that were quite annoying to wipe clean.  The construction of the lamp is decent but nothing to be proud of.  ""Heavy Duty"" is definitely a relative term and personally I would not label this product ""Heavy Duty"".  The rods that anchor the spring stabilizers are connected to a flimsy threaded rod that ties in with the frame.  I have had the lamp for about a month and its still holding up okay but I won't be surprised if they come loose often and need periodic tightening.  So as a conclusion it's a good choice for a good price since the majority of other products out there for this price range are pure garbage but that's what you get when you want to pay next to nothing for items build by cheap labor ;)",3.0

As far as ordering another one, that is still up in the air, guess it will depand on my mood that day.

"These work well until they fail.  I bought this countersink set and a few boxes of deck screws.  The tapered drill works well.  It cuts through composite deck boats and wood very well.  It leaves a nice counter sink and a like the fact that the pre-drilled hole is not a uniform diameter.  I think the screw bite better.

But one MAJOR flaw in the design of this tool.  The round drill bit is set into the 1/4 hex shank using GLUE.  The glue fails after the drill is used for some time and gets slightly warm.  In my case it failed after about 300 screws (#8 x 2.5"").  After it fails you can see this white plastic stuff on the part of the drill bit that came out and more  of the stuff still lining the hole in the 1/4"" hex shank.  They SHOULD have used some form of mechanical connection that does not depend on adhesive.

That said the bit is still usable without the hex shank.  Simply close the drill chuck down on the drill bit like you would with a normal 3/16 drill bit.  But you can't use the quick change feature.  Also I assume this is a warranty issue and I will ask for a replacement.
No, I did NOT abuse this tool, it was not ""hot"" when it failed just warm, but if used while warm the glue fails.  I think that is a root of the poor design, they used a kind of glue that looses strength as it gets warm.

Good tool if you only occasionally need to countersink a few screws.  But not if you have a five pound box of screws.  It works well enough I will get it replaced and keep it with my drills.",3.0

"these bits are perfect if you crave mediocrity. the drill bits are cheap and easy to bend/damage, which is actually really awesome. because of the length of the bits, the countersink cutter will not line up straight on the bit when you move it down the shaft, since the set screws don't have an even surface to sit on. in addition, since there is no stop collar, it is impossible to reliably drill flush countersinking holes if you are using a hand drill and not a drill press with a depth stop.

these bits are exceptionally average, and will please the palate of the american handyman. we truly deserve these, for twenty dollars or less.",3.0

"I was super excited to find a good 9inch blade for my vintage craftsman; however I was a little bummed with the performance. It cuts, and thanks to the thin kerf it doesn't bind too much, but I'm experiencing a burn on a somewhat regular basis. I've adjusted the fence several times and managed to get it as square as I reasonably can with the big cast iron fence it comes with...but to no avail. For those who don't know, a poorly aligned fence can cause wood burn. I'm not a professional, though, so the burn very well may be still because of my adjustments...so take my review with a grain of salt.",3.0

The material the tapered bits are cast from is extremely weak. One bit bent while I was tightening the bolt with the allen key! I was able to straighten it back easily by hand however. Another bit broke the first time I used it when I stopped drilling the first hole and rocked the drill slightly while extracting it from the hole. I have not used the third as yet. I plan on placing the counter sink collars on regular bits once all the original bits break. They do work well once you treat them with kid gloves.,3.0

"These drill bits cut ok. The issue I have with them is that the depth adjustment doesn't seem to hold very well. I have tried several times to tighten the allen screws, but invariably the adjustment will slip while I am drilling a hole, resulting in drilling too deep. To fix this, I took a 1/2"" wood dowel and cut one in length for each of the few screw sizes I use, then drilled a hole through the center of the dowel to match the drill bit size. I remove the countersink collar, slip the dowel on the bit, then reinstall the countersink collar. Now, if it slips it will only rotate, not slip down towards the shank of the bit. With this mod, the bits work fine.",3.0

"My deck is 5/4 x 6 Ipe on treated joists. I capped the joists with Grace Vycor flashing (flexible stick-on rubber flashing) for rot protection. I found the Bo Wrench slips on the flashing, partly because the grip pins are smooth, making it difficult to use. Removing the flashing would, of course, leave the joists unprotected. So beware if you are using flexible joist flashing. If the manufacturer added some roughness on the surface of the gripping pins or perhaps a hard-rubber ring near the bottom of the pins, it might alleviate this problem.

Also, the orange paint on the tool left faint orange streaks on the sides of the Ipe deck boards, and the wire clips for the retaining pins pop off much too easily.

Still, I found it to be a valuable tool.",3.0
"I used the tool to reassemble a water damaged deck. I rebuilt a rotted, irregular shaped sleeper frame and put back in place about 18 warped 6"" Ipe boards. I wished the tool gave me a bit more leverage with some of the most recalcitrant boards, but it did the job. I don't have a huge amount of experience building decks. I can't compare the BoWrench with other products, but I wondered if the cost of tool was high relative to the materials that went into the unit. Other issues:

1. This was not a problem for me, but, if your deck is walled in, and your boards are warped at the rim joists, the tool is going to be of marginal (sic) help.
2. The instructions are minimal.
3. The cotter pins have a tendency to pop out. This started as an occasional problem, but it seemed to increase in frequency over time and it seemed most likely to happen when I was working with the trickiest boards. By the time I reached my last few boards, the pins were popping out on 30-40% of my attempts to use the tool. I was working on a roof deck; the entire neighborhood probably heard my cursing. There has to be a way to provide a product that, out of the box, has a more secure fastener for the clevis pins.

I suggest all three of the following remedies to the issue with the cotter pin: (a) The manufacturer should supply a more secure pin. (b) The manufacturer should supply a few extra pins in the parts package. (3) The deck builder should be sure to bring extra pins to the work site.

The minimalist parts components and the above defects did not make me feel that the tool was a great value. On other hand, given the warped boards I was handling, the tool was invaluable. I am not sure how I would have reassembled the deck without the BoWrench.",3.0

"I ordered this item, it shipped in a timely manner. I opened it up ready to get to work on a Saturday morning on my deck, opened it up, and all of the pins that hold it together were not in the box. I had to use a prybar instead. I bet it works great when I get the pins to put it together.",3.0
"This bit is definitely tricky to set up, however it can produce a nice joint. If you have very soft wood and only a few joints to make, it may work out better for you than it did for me. I found that it dulled quickly doing end-grain joints in pine and clear vertical grain fir. I treated it very gently, not feeding too hard. By the time I got it tested, tweaked and ready to go, it was starting to go dull -- a very, very unusual occurance with any Freud product in my experience so far.

It's possible that a lock miter cutter that has three blades instead of the two on this one, or a larger diameter, might stay cool and function well on harder woods, or woods that retain heat.

No instructions were available on the Freud web site. The packaging also lacked documentation. I switched to a less desirable but faster and easier half blind locking joint that I can make quickly with a table saw and a quarter inch dato blade.

This bit, and probably most bits of its fancy nature, require a really terrific, precision router table and fence setup to work well. A set of especially nice and expensive measurement tools for that router table will help. Cost to do that well gets into full-blown shaper territory money-wise fast. Most router tables will require a jig to hold the work piece perpendicular to the router table for one piece of the two piece joint. Be sure to study how your intended work pieces will need to pass the bit on your set up.

It DOES make a very nice joint when all is dialed in, before it dulls.",3.0

"Received the 34-124 Quadra-cut round over bit and it does indeed have 4 blades which does great work if all you do is round overs, but it does not work for beading operations.  As stated by previous comments, the 34-124 Quadra round over bit cannot do beading work as is.  Per Freud's website for the 34-124 router bit ""For beading work, equip the bits with a Freud 62-102 bearing and 62-311 step washer""
34-124 has a 1/4"" post while both the 62-102 bearing and the 62-311 step washer have a 3/16"" inside dia. which obviously will not fit the 34-124's 1/4"" post, thus the 34-124 Quadra-cut round over bit is not able to perform beading work.  I sent an email to Freud stating this and that their website information is incorrect.  Will update comment if I hear anything back from them.",3.0

I have other Freud router bits with 1/2"" bearings but the inside dia. on the quadra cut bit is 1/4"" and all the other Freud bearings are smaller 3/16"" inside dia. so they will not fit on the router bit post.  This should be explained more clearly and noted in the picture that you need to purchase the 1/2"" bearing to achieve this type of cut or just include this bearing.",3.0
Good quality bit. The 1-1/4 inch is the diameter of the bit not the height of the cut. Had to buy another bit due to this lack of correct information.,3.0
"First of all, I am very happy with the nice clean cut I get with rounding operations using this bit. I've used it on elm end grain with no problems. Here's what ticks me off:

1. The additional cutting bits that make this a quadra  are partial length and (as far as I can see) don't come into play with a simple rounding over operation. They come into play only when you do beading, which you can't do with this bit as it is. I would have bought the standard bit if I had known that.

2. In order to do beading you have to purchase ANOTHER bearing and washer to the tune of about $26.

3. If you decide it's worth it to part with the $26, you'll find that the bearing recommended for this bit has an ID of 3/16"" The shank on the end of the bit is 1/4"". Both amazon and the Freud website have the same conflicting information.

But this set has a flaw in its design. Yes, you can flip the pieces over, but look closely and you'll notice the top edge of the curved cutter is shorter than the side of the ball bearing guide.
Basically, when you flip it over the curved cutter does not match the profile of the wood you just routed with it upside down. Routing the female counterpart ends up being a very tedious ordeal because of it.",3.0

I ordered a Freud Quadra-Cut router bit right off one of their current magazine ads - part number 38-106, just as pictured and specified in the ad.  What I received was a 2-wing bit, NOT the 4-wing Quadra-Cut bit featured and pictured in their ads.
I called Freud.  They say the reason I got the older 2-wing design is that they don't change the part number when going to a new design for a standard profile - they just keep using the old part number for the new design of the same profile.  And they don't start shipping the new design until all their inventory of the old design has been sold.
In the meantime, the customer takes pot-luck; he might get the new design and he might not - no sure way to know.  I consider this a kind of bait-and-switch in advertising, with a good dose of confusion added to the mix.  Not a good way to treat customers and distributors.  Not a smart way to build a positive image for your company.
Why not just change the part number for a new design? At least add an ""a""  or a ""b"" to the part number, so the customer can order the exact design generation that he wants.  That is what other manufacturers do, and it avoids confusion for the end-user.  The present system makes it difficult for me to have confidence I'll really get what I want when ordering anything with the Freud brand on it.
This is no reflection on Amazon; they did their part quickly and efficiently.  But Freud needs some review of their procedures.",3.0
"I gave it 3 stars because it works, but question whether it's necessary to deal with the futz-factor. The setup on a table mounted router takes some work to setup. Even after the setup, and keeping the test piece for the next time to speed things up, you'll still probably have some adjusting to do (as usual for any routing, but particularly joinery where there are angles on this bit involved). On the drawer project where I used this bit, I made the cuts at the front of the drawer with the router and this bit, and used a standard tongue dado at the back just to compare fit and ease. The fit was excellent on both and so was the strength of the joint. My conclusion: This is an exotic bit for doing what you can get done on the table saw with a simple 1/4"" dado cutter and a setup that looks like this link and get it done more quickly with easier measurement-oriented setup and less trial and error. See - http://www.woodsmithtips.com/2010/08/26/tongue-and-dado-joint/. If you have a production run, and a shop setup that lets you leave it for doing the draw joinery over and over on the same thickness material, then go for it... you can leave the table saw for ripping and cross-cutting.",3.0

"Powermatic seriously needs to rethink it's packaging.
This thing was wedged together (forced tight, so say goodbye to the paint on the connected areas) and stuffed into a loose cardboard box.
The hardware bag was also loose in there. No foam or cardboard to pad it out. No plastic bag over the frame. Nothing.
I've had nightmare experiences with powermatic before where other items also had several problems like this where they seemingly sent out brand new products terribly packaged that were entirely destroyed by the time they made it through a delivery system.

This piece in particular arrived with the box bearly hanging together, holes punched all over it, and one of the wheel lock knobs smashed.

As another reviewer pointed out, this is the older design where the wheel pin is a cheap plastic affair that screws directly to the castors on each side.
Not the best of ideas for a rubber wheel. The simple addition of a plastic strip to wedge wetween the bolt and wheel would fix this.
Can't imagine why they'd leave it so cheap. Idealy a design where you didn't have to bend down, the same way the rear castors lock would be better.
I've no idea if they still make the other/improved design.

This aside the base seems strong and very heavy duty. My one was too broken to accept and the frame itself was bent and the paint was ruined.
I'll order another from elsewhere and perhaps see if they can repackage it a little before shipment.

*UPDATE*
Well I tried ordering one again...Same thing happened.
The box was in worse shape still this time. It had been taped back together at some point and all the hardware was missing.
Again, all items were loose in a single layer cardboard box. Remember this thing weighs 45 pounds, is angle ground welded fairly sharp edged metal and the box is loose fitting.
I'm amazed it made it at all. Even the assembly instructions in this order were torn to shreds.

The frame on this one isn't buckled at least so I've decided to keep it because I need one.
I had to buy my own bolts/nuts/washers of course and I'll need a can of black paint to cover the scrapes, but I need the darned thing and I don't see another way of picking one up as I don't have any dealers local to me.

"My latest toy is a Powermatic Model 66. This is one fine machine! However, for my particular shop arrangement I required the ability to move it around a bit. After researching the various manufacturers of mobile bases I decided upon the Powermatic version. For me, the real selling point was the improvement they had made to the wheel locking mechanism. The older style of lock was simply a bolt that you screwed into the surface of the wheel - not great- because it eventually galls the wheel. The new design incorporates a top positioned adjuster and tension band that allows a firmer capture of the wheel, without the former galling problem. I ordered what I thought was the newly designed base through Amazon but when I opened the box I discovered they had shipped the older, inferior version. On top of that the shipping box had a large hole in one side, one of the light weight plastic adjuster knobs was broken and one of the frame bolt sets was missing. I guess that's what I get for ordering a piece of equipment through the blind ended Amazon type of system. I should have purchased the base directly from a Powermatic distributor.",3.0

"First I should say that the product and its construction seem to be top notch. The hook itself gets 5 stars. The problem we had was that the bolt was too short to secure the wingnut. Most of our ladders are the 300lb rated extra heavy duty. They have a slightly larger rung than the 225/250lb. We had to put everything on hold while someone ran to the hardware store and got a longer bolt and new wingnuts. Only cost $4, but thats not the point. Simply adding a bolt with an extra 1/2"" would make sure that every person who buys this product can use it without modification.

Also, these things are heavy! Two of these on the end of one section of a 32' ladder was a bear. Be careful when running it up to the ridge, if you get a little to the left or right it will take off down the roof. Good luck stopping it, roll it over quick. Overall a great product.

"I've been using this for over four years and although I'm happy enough with it I wouldn't but it again.

You all know the benefits of a good fence so I won't go into that.  It was a huge upgrade over my stock fence that came with my Grizzly back in the 80's so I'd be happy with anything.  However there's two flaws that would stop be from recommending it to anyone and both of them have to do with the locking mechanism.

First off, it has a tendency to shimmy a little when you lock it down.  That right there should scare someone off.  I've only been working on my fixer-upper house (trim, cabinets, etc.) so I haven't done any high end work that would make me irate yet.  But it's only a matter of time.

Second, the way it locks down is incredibly cheap.  In between the lever and the bar there's a little metal tab that acts as a shim when locking it down.  Mine broke long ago (easily within a year).  The metal just gets worn down when locking it over and over.  Replacing it involves making a new one with a thin piece of steel (old hack saw blades work okay) and at least fifteen minutes to cut it down, drill necessary holes, and install it.  I see no reason they should even design them this way in the first place and every single time it breaks you'll find me swearing.  It'll break right when you're in the middle of project.

I'd recommend one of the more name brand options that the high end companies rely on for their saws.",3.0
"I bought this fence to upgrade my Ridgid R4512.  I really wanted to like this fence.  In fact it does have some really nice features, and I want to mention those.

Installation was considerably easy, especially when compared to other aftermarket fences.  I only had to drill/tap one hole in the back left corer of my table.  Other than that, everything fit right in to the existing holes.  The adjustable mounting brackets make it extremely easy to level and set the rails at the appropriate height.  Once installed, the fence really is solid.  There's a little play when sliding back and forth, but it always seems to lock parallel to the mitre slot.  The micro-adjuster works great too.

But unfortunately for me, the cons outweighed the pros, and the price...  There isn't any one thing that stands out.  It was the sum of a lot of really small things.  The packaging was inadequate for the weight of the product.  Parts were clearly moving around in transit and left the fence with small nicks and dings.  The formica insert was molding, but there were no signs that the box itself had been wet, so I wonder if it was packaged that way.  My disappointment grew as I continued to unpack everything.  There were rattles of loose pieces coming from inside the fence.  I popped off the end plate to find shavings from where the holes had been drilled out (see pics).  I began to examine everything more closely and the poor craftsmanship really became apparent.  The mounting brackets for the front rail look like they had been machined by, I don't know what... See the pictures.

Despite these issues, I proceeded to install everything in hopes that the end result would be enough to save this fence for me.  But there was something about the way it slides across the table that really bothered me.  I wanted that buttery smooth glide of a beis, or even a beis-like t-style.  This fence just doesnt have that.  The whole thing just feels like some guy with a bit of machining experience decided to make his own fence.  Its functional, but with the kinks of a homemade project.  People keep commenting about how great it is that this fence is made in the USA.  If this is what US manufacturing is like, then Im only buying imports from now on.  Some might be able to look past these issues, and I have no problems with that.  Heck, I probably could look past them had the fence been $100 cheaper.",3.0

"The lock mitre bit works as advertised and is good quality. However, I will stay away from most lock miter bits in the future since you really do need the right size lock miter jig to set up the bit. I could not find anyone including Freud who makes a 1 inch jig for this bit making it most difficult to use. For those who have ever used a lock miter bit, you know what I mean. Any company that produces and sells a lock miter bit should supply the correct jig as well and Freud does not do this.",3.0

I ended up returning this bit before I even used it because I needed to match a standard door lip for a customer and there was no way this bit was going to be even close to matching it.  I ended up using a standard round-over bit set a 1/8"" above the table to give it a reveal, and a 22.5 degree chamfer bit for the lower part of the profile.

Limitations that you should be aware of:

1) Heavy (x 2).

2) you can't use this on a part of a roof with a ridge vent - it follows the contour of the roof - there is not space underneath to clear a ridge vent.

3)  The edges are very sharp and it will dig into whatever roof material you have when you try to flip the ladder over after rolling it up the roof - you MUST rig up some padding.  I duct-taped on some left over pipe insulation.",3.0
"This router bit produces a very nice look. However, when trying to create my drawer pulls in the center of the drawer fronts (18 of them), there was a lot of tearout on exiting the cut. I tried slowing the router bit to no avail. I even tried cutting off in increments of 1/32"" to a partial success. However, I still got tearout on the majority of my cuts.

"Overall the build quality is good for the price of the item.  I did have to accomplish several tasks to get the fence to work smoothly.  First, the mounting holes in the bottom of the front bar were stripped, or not tapped properly.  I have to get larger bolts and drill and re-tap the threads to make it usable.  The back rail is of poor quality; it was painted with black enamal over what looks like areas of rust and imperfections in the surface.  I had to sand the rail down smooth and re-prime/paint it.  The flanges to the right of the rail, designed to support installing further support surface ro the right, are uneven (front to back) by nearly 1 1/4 when installed.  I understand that this fence was designed to use with different saws; however, an adjustment built into the supports would have been nice.  I bolted on lenths of 2X4s and used table levers installed upside-down to be able to adjust my router table to match the height of the table on the saw.  The picture shows anti-kickback unit; nope, didn't come with the saw.  The fence itself was pre-drilled to attach sacrifical wood/uhmp on either side of the fence.  Screws were provided to attach it on one side of the fence only.  It should be noted that the drilled holes were not countersunk.  So, if you did use the screws as provided, the head would protrude on the opposite side.  I tappped the holes and used 6mm panhead screws to MDF on either side of the fence (countersunk).  It works great..NOW...",3.0
"The fence is fantastic, however it was not as easy to install on my older Delta.  I spent several hours over a few days and almost threw in the towel, but I finally got it on and setup.

Hand drawn diagrams are very unprofessional in my opinion.",3.0
"So i bought the Vega to upgrade an 20 year old Central Machinery cabinet table saw. The upside is that the fence bolts right on quickly with no modification. The downside... really Vega? Welding splatter under the paint. Painted parts not powder coated. Burrs that had to be filed off of the fence carrier. Peeling paint. An embarrassment in my shop.

I will say this... repeatability of position is good and square.

"Just want to comment about the quality of workmanship of this fence. I purchased and installed the fence on my vintage 50's Craftsman table saw. In all fairness, I didn't get to use it yet and it seems sturdy and should be pretty accurate. I'll review that part later. When I unpackaged everything and started to assemble, I couldn't believe what rough work is done regarding the mounting holes, and bracket bending. I've been a machinist and CNC programmer for 30yrs in the Aerospace trade, so I know what I'm talking about. Holes were drilled and tapped off center, brackets are bent beyond 90. Clearance holes are way too big for bolts. The worst and most important part, IMO, is the two front extruded aluminum brackets that hold the guide rail on. They require two slots for mounting the fence and rail to the table. Instead of machining the slots so they are clean and straight, they are obviously stamped out. Looks like the punch was pretty dull on the set that I got. The finished slots looked like they were made with a chain saw. I needed to spend time in deburring all the brackets and chasing the threaded holes so I could assemble everything. The round guide rail mounting holes were not drilled in a straight line and one hole out of the 6 had a gouge in it from a drill walking off the material. Somebody at Vega should get a grip on their processes and quality control. It should not be all about making a ton of money, it's should also be about quality and pride.",3.0

"This is more a review of using a router-table to make box-joints.  However, I bought this bit specifically to make box joints.  I am using Incra's original jig with their fence and right-angle attachment.  As you probably know, the right-angle attachment isn't firmly attached to anything, it merely slides along the fence.  I bought this bit so that I could begin making box-joints.  But is hasn't worked out.  As soon as the bit touches the stock, it yanks the right-angle fence/stock forward.  It's disconcerting to say the least.  I am sure I will find other uses for the bit.",3.0

"I ordered the bit and immediately set to word on a client's door. Only after milling everything and mortising my stiles did I notice the differences in the profiles.

One would think that a company such as Freud would have their quality assurance program worked out so this stuff does not happen. Be very wary prior to using these bits and ensure that they all have the same profile.",3.0
Serves it purpose. Dealing with it on the end of an extension ladder section up on the roof is problematic due to the additional weight that the unit presents. Instructions are to use two hooks for safety and that adds a further burden due to the weight. The wheel does assist in sliding the ladder and hook up the roof. Lighter weight construction of the hook and use on one unit would result in higher rating of this item.,3.0

The remaining hardware had raw edges and was raw unpainted metal. I cleaned it up and painted the hardware to prevent rust. The quality did not live up to the description on the Vega web site.

Hold downs and clamps, feather boards, miter gauges, etc. to stabilize the wood is essential.  When the board was horizontal, I had no problems with getting a very good cut on the edge.  Vertical boards were a whole different story.  Long story short is that I took the bit out of my Kreg router table and then used it on my horizontal router table from MLCS.  Much safer and cleaner cut.  Basic instructions that come with the bit are just that, basic.  Look up some videos, lots of practice cuts and be patient.  My box came out very nice at the corners but it took a good bit of patience. The reason for 3 stars is due to the lack of specific instructions and needing 2 router tables to get a satisfactory fit.  Will use it again now that I have the basic experience with it.",3.0

"I installed this fence system on my Ridgid R4512 table saw.  The stock fence that came with my saw was useless to me do to the deflection and inability of the fence to lock square to the table regardless of adjustments.  I opted to get a this fence system instead of a new saw.
I anticipated a fair amount of work to get this fence installed on my table saw and was not disappointed.  I needed to drill 2 new holes in the cast iron of my table to be configured per the directions, which indicate that the holes need to be spaced from 8-9 inches from the blade on either side and that they are centered 1 3/16"" from the top.  My problem was that the holes were not down far enough.  One of my stock holes was at the 8 inch mark so I needed to veer from the ideal hole spacing to an alternate. I adjusted my spacing to 16 inches apart using a 3/8 inch bit drill bit.  This modification also requires that you either drill the round front rail tube to match what will be your 0 indicator for the attached tape ruler or remove the tape and reapply it to the adjusted 0 point.  I opted to remove the tape ruler and adjust.  If you want to drill new holes in the round bar you will need a 17/64 drill bit and a 5/16-18 tap.  The rear rail is square tubing and needs 7/16 clearance from the top of the table.  The holes on your table saw are recommended to be centered at 1 3/16 inches from the table top and 8 inches from the blade on either side.  I found that my 1 1/16 inch from the top holes to be adequate.  One of my holes was 8 inches from the blade but the other was 11 inches from the blade so I opted to drill a hole through the supplied rear tube to match my existing hole.  After installing the front and rear rail supports I installed the fence and head per the directions and aligned the fence to a miter slot.  I have a dial indicator and used it ensure the alignment was accurate to a couple thousands.  The standard install requires that you install a bracket on the back of the fence because the fence lifts as you lock the cam in the front.  I tested the fences operation and noticed that the fence, once locked, had a deflection of approximately 0.01 to 0.015 inches when moderate pressure was applied.  I found this very disappointing.  I also noticed that the fine adjustment did not work per the directions.  Learning from others I discovered that the main locking cam could be removed and reversed to allow the fence to lock on the up stroke instead of the down stroke.  So I removed the cam and reversed it.  This operation is very easy with a 3/16 steel rod and a hammer.  The result was that the fence no longer jumped in the back when locking the fence and did not need the rear fence bracket.  The fine adjustment knob now worked and I had about 0.005 inch deflection with moderate pressure to the rear of the fence.  I verified this on several locations along the fence and the results were consistent.  I'm not sure why the deflection was lessened but I'm glad it was.  I then constructed a table extension per the directions and installed it on my saw.  I am now happy with this fence system.  One final note, the configuration of your saw might also require a 11/32 drill bit and 3/8-24 tap if your saw does not allow access for a nut for the fence rail installs.  Most of the reviews for this fence were for 1980 Craftsman saws that required no modification.  My install was time consuming but the design is robust enough to allow for considerable tolerances making a custom install much easier.",3.0
"I bought 2 because of other reviews. Makes the end of the ladder a bit heavy. With the swivel casters it makes the ladder a little hard to control rolling it up the roof, not real bad though, you just have to pay attention to which direction it wants to go and counter it. Once in place I felt quite safe while on the ladder and I weigh 280 pounds. I also added some padding to the hook to protect the roof shingles. I just used some foam pipe insulation for 3/4 inch pipe and duct taped it in place. Worked fine and no damage to shingles.",3.0
"i got the VEGA pro 40 for x-mass and my father and i spent a very frustrating boxing day installing it.

We have a Delta Shopmaster 10"" table saw.

Apparently the Vega instructions that say ""installs to all Delta 10"" table saws do not apply to the Shopmaster series.  The Vega instructions, while amusing, do not help overly much. aside from the first line which says ""Think"" .... no i'm not kidding.
and the part that says the included hardware is not necessarily useful for all saws.

in short, we ended up not using ANY of the screws provided, and we had to drill one hole in the stainless steel main support, extend one of the channels in the aluminum support bracket and cut the corner off it so that my miter slot was still accessible. The most useful thing about the instructions was the picture.

After finally completing the set up it does appear to work well.

One thing that surprised me was that the clamping mechanism is only on the front rail, the rear rail is only a vertical support with a small nylon slider. this means that even after the fence is bolted to the carriage ""Very tightly"" (as specified in the instructions) it is still possible to push the far end out of alignment, but i have not found this to be easy to do under normal use.

In short, there is LOTS of fuss to get it set up. However, i would hope anyone that has a big dangerous piece of equipment like a table saw can figure out installation.  And i did find it to be a vast improvement on the stock fence.  But if the extra $120 seems worth it to you for absolutely rigid fence then go for the Incra.",3.0
"As per the description, two of these are required per ladder.  However, after unpacking and setting them up next to each other on a flat workbench, the large bends near the wheel end are not consistent with each other.  There is about a half inch difference.  I have yet to actually use these on a roof, so I am not sure if this will impact the way the ladder sits.  It may be that when weight is applied they will seek a balance, but only time will tell.

The free shipping was great and they arrived as promised.",3.0
"The fence that I received must have had some rough handling and stored for some time. It was covered with dust and the measurement scale was scratched in several places.
The cross bar that attaches the fence to rail was quite rough on the engaging surface and I spent some time polishing the surface so that it would slide smoothly.
The sides of the fence were also quite rough, I plan to attach some smooth sliding plastic or a melamine covering.

I bought the fence with the 50 inch Fence Bar, and found out later that this model has been discontinued. Maybe that's why it was so dirty, stored away in a corner until found and sold on amazon.

Some reviews had this fence as second only to the Beismeyer and better because of the micro-adjust feature. I disagree, this unit was poorly made, poorly handled and a disappointment for my 300 bucks.",3.0
"definitely not a universal, bolt-on replacement. It ended up being a completely custom installation on my DeWalt DW746 requiring many new holes to be drilled & tapped. Even so, I could have been happy if there hadn't been other issues. As others have said, some of the mounting hardware is rather crude & needed rough/sharp edges to be cleaned up. I also had a problem with repeatability that I couldn't resolve. I ended up reluctantly returning the whole thing to Amazon, who really earned my gratitude & future business by accepting the return with no hassle. In the end, I thought that 3 stars was fair: it may be perfect for many others, but it didn't quite fill the bill for what I was looking for.",3.0
"This is the second 40 inch Vega fence I have owned.  I was very happy with the first one which I used on an old Wadkins Bursgreen saw.  When I upgraded to a SawStop, I ordered another Vega fence instead of the one SawStop sells.  The design changed slightly over the years.  The back rail with a retainer on the out feed side was a good addition.  The fit and finish on the new fense was a dissapointment.  The aluminum brackets that hold the front rail looked like some one had taken a very course grinder to take off some burrs.  The part of the aluminum extrusion that slides on the front rail had paint overspray on it and the fine adjust mechanism was not properly aligned.  I got it tuned up and am now happy with it, but I might have thrown in the towel if I had not owned one before.  I knew it would take some modification to fit the SawStop saw.  That made a lot of extra work, but I was expecting that.  Two hints I might pass along are: 1) Do not set the fence exactly paralel to the blade and miter slot.  Instead follow the recomendation that comes with Forrest blades and set the out-feed end of the fence a few thousands farther from the blade than the infeed end. (I think Forrest recommends 5 thousands, but the fence and my table are longer than typical so I set mine to 7 thousands farther at the back).  2) use a little paste wax on the top of the front rail.  I also had to scotchbrite the extrusion that rides on the rail because of the overspray.  Ultimately it is a good fence I still prefer it to others, but had I not had the first one I might not have known how good it could be.",3.0
"Nice job Amazon.

I was doubtful, but placed one order, and got one hook. Why they have ""2 Pack"" in the photo is beyond me.  (not to mention inaccurate and deceptive)

"The hook is solid enough to handle your weight with only one hook, just tried it.  If you plan to use it often, get two.

Need something to protect your roof surface, especially a painted metal roof.",3.0
"This bit certainly does what it says and does a nice job.  It makes a finger joint but, as the picture shows, the outside edges on the one side get to be a feathered edge that is so thin it does not allow for planing or sanding of those serfaces without tiny pieces falling away.

There is no question that the joint would be strong but it should be used only where the edge as you see it in the picture is showing, not the flat or face side (as if looking down from the top or up from the bottom in the picture).

In other words it is for end-to-end joining of pieces the thickness of the bit only.  It does not work as a glue joint for gluing up panels, i.e. gluing up boards side to side, which is what I purchased it for.

In my ignorance I thought that is what it was for and my only reason for giving it a low grade is that I am disappointed that I had to spend so much money to find out that I should have purchased the Reversable Glue Joint bit.

Freud should say that the Finger Joint Bit is not a glue joint bit for making panels where the feather edge will show.  It does not work for that and it seems the explanation should point someone to the other bit if you are making panels.  Nothing wrong with the bit, just the purpose should be explained.

So I will try to say it again another way, the finger joint does not work for gluing small pieces together to make a wider board, like for raised panel doors.  It is for making narrow, short boards into narrow longer boards. It is not for making narrow boards wider.",3.0
"I've had this fence for a week now and have had time to use it a bit. These are my impressions based on what I observed during the installation and using it for the past week.

Installation - there are two brackets that hold the front fence rail to the saw. I have a Jet contractor's saw, and the brackets didn't line up with the pre-existing holes on the front of the saw. The brackets are about an inch closer together than the holes, which means one bracket slides on completely while the other is barely over the hole. Instead of boring out and tapping new holes, I went with that. Boring out and tapping would also have to be done too close to the existing hole. The back rail went on just fine, and the fence went together very easily. When I brought the fence right up to the blade to set the ""0"" mark on the indicator, I found that there wasn't enough play to adjust the indicator window to the ""0"" mark. Instead, I had to peel the measuring tape off the front rail and move it down about half an inch, after which I could zero out the fence.

Performance - overall, I'm very pleased with the performance of the fence. It slides along the rails easily and locks down securely using the main locking mechanism. The fence is rock solid with very little deflection. One thing I would like to have seen are fence sides, either laminated MDF or UHMW. They include long wood screws for anyone who would like to add an auxiliary fence side.

There are two locking mechanisms on the fence: The big main one and a smaller one for use with the micro-adjuster. The way you use the micro-adjuster is you lock the fence down with the small lever, then release the big lever. This frees you up to make micro adjustments to the fence position. When you have dialed in the correct distance, you then lock the big lever down and unlock the small lever. The micro-adjuster locking mechanism on mine slips very easily, however. When I lock the small lever down and start dialing, sometimes the fence stays put and the micro-adjuster moves. If I push the fence from side to side while the small lever is locked down, it moves with little effort. I am going to see if cleaning with mineral spirits and roughing up the locking cam with some sandpaper will fix this.

Overall, I think this fence is pretty good. It's certainly better than the stock Jet Fence that came with my saw (bigger, beefier, and more solid). I gave it a 3 only because it didn't fit my saw properly (which is a common saw) right out of the box and the micro-adjuster slippage. Otherwise, I'd recommend this fence to anyone upgrading from a stock fence.",3.0

"I had higher hopes for this strap clamp.  Perhaps I thought I was ""smarter"" or was sure other reviewers were missing something.  When you can get them in perfect placement with the corner braces in place, it works well.  It also works well as a strap without them.  It is quite difficult to get all four corners placed properly at once without other people helping, and even if they're in place, tightening the strap can sometimes move them out of position.  It's still not a bad clamp, but unless you have a number of more hands than I have, don't expect that you'll consistently get 4 corners on every time without swearing.",3.0

The quality of the clamp itself however, is very good. You can really crank up some serious tension with the handle when you need too. I bought three different styles of clamps- this one, a one handed ratcheting clamp, and an extremely inexpensive simple clamp to see which worked best for my particular job. The one hand ratcheting clamp came in a close second place- the Bessey I hate to say was the hardest to use of the three. And believe it or not- the $5.99 ones I bought from HB were the best. I payed $50 each for the one handed ratcheting clamps! Yikes!! I think that the Bessey is a quality tool for the money; make sure you're buying the correct tool for YOUR job and not waste money on something that you don't need. Like I said on a simple 4 sided box- the plastic pivoting corners on this clamp were hard to get in the right position. This could be an asset for doing glue ups of more irregularly shaped objects. If that's what you're gluing up- this could perhaps be the perfect tool for you. I just wanted to share my experience with this product as it relates to a four sided object. Hope this helps someone!",3.0
"I've owned this drill press about 2 years now, having purchased through Amazon.com.  I'm very pleased with the operation of the machine.  The delivery of the press left something to be desired as Amazon shipped via Eagle who delivered in a truck without a lift gate.  As the entire package was significantly beyond my capability to get it out of the truck alone (driver was unhelpful), this was a major pain.  Once in my shop, setup was typical of a woodworking machine.  The drill press is excellent, the setup is normal, the shipping was poor.",3.0

"I recently purchased a Delta 17-965 Drill Press and am relatively happy with the product. The machining on it was no where near as good as things made in the USA but overall exceptable. The problem I'm having is the runout on the spindle is over .0015, which is way more than is exceptable. Does anyone have any sugggestions on how to corerect this, I have tried to pound the spindle in farther thinking maybe it would center itself.",3.0
"I've owned this drill press for over a year and while there's no doubt that it is a good product, it does have some shortcomings.  I use it mainly for woodworking and general home workshop needs.  Here's my list of pros and cons:
Pros:
- Very good power
- It's quiet and vibration free (Mine sits on a concrete floor)
- The extra long quill stroke is extremely useful
- The quill lockscrew is also very useful, especially while setting heights and aligning bits to workpieces
- There is very little runout if the chuck is installed properly
- The depth stop comes with a quick adjust nut (however this is also the source of my biggest complaint)
Cons:
- The belt tensioning handle is very short (I've started using a short piece of pipe to slip over the handle so that I can get adequate tension on the belts using one hand while tightening the tensioning lock screws with the other)
- The heads on the tensioning screws (T-shaped thumbscrews) are small and difficult to use, especially if you have a tendency to overtighten things as I do.
- My biggest complaint - The quick adjust nut slips on the depth stop bolt during use.  I've found that it happens when the release button on the nut faces a certain direction.  After ruining a couple of pieces for projects, I've started using a hex nut (metric, as I recall) to lock the quick adjust nut in place.  Needless to say, this defeats the whole purpose of having a quick adjust nut.
- As others have mentioned, in order to tilt the table, you have to loosen a bolt with a wrench in very tight quarters.  It's a pain in the butt.  To make matters worse, the tilt guide/scale that shows the angle of the table is slightly off and there's no way to make adjustments.  While this may be a problem that's limited to my machine, it's definitely worth checking if you buy one.  Keep your engineer's square close by -
- My final gripe is with the on/off switch.  Although it works fine to stop and start the machine, it is without a doubt the roughest, loudest, crudest switch I've ever used.  I know that I'm picky, but this switch is pitiful.
Would I buy this machine again???  Perhaps...but I would take a real close look at some others before I made a final decision.  The sad thing is that for two or three extra dollars, Delta could have turned a fairly good machine into one that is outstanding.",3.0
great drill press but amazon didn't ship the 'free mortising attachment $69.99 value' that was promised in the ad.,3.0
"When looking at drill presses there are machines that cost the same or less than this one and have comparable specs. (JET) However, this machine had a longer stroke and the Delta name so I decided to splurge for the ""Delta name and quality"".
I unpacked the drill (it seemed well packed) and assembled it. The directions were ok, not great, but good enough. Cleaning the gallons of packing greasse off of the machine took some time. I plugged it in and POW, it blows the circuit breaker, and I could swear I saw a flash. Now this is the same outlet I have run my table saw from, so what gives? I decided try to try it on a dedicated 20 amp line. I try it again...It started to turn ok, but I saw a couple of blue flashes (at that time I wasn't sure it was normal or not). At least it was running.
On to the ""genuine delta"" mortissing attachment. (extra on the Delta, included on the Jet) As someone else pointed out, you have to sacrifice over an inch of travel to install the Delta Mortissing attachment by moving the quillion clamp. So much for easy mortising and the longer stroke length. However, once it is set up, installing and removing the mortiser is not too bad.
Somehow I expected it to run smoother, but I proceed to drill a few holes in some scrap wood anyway. It seems to work ok, but the motor sounds funny. Then I notice the stream of SMOKE coming out of the top of the motor. I stop the motor and OUCH, too hot to touch. I guess those blue flashes were not normal. This was after only 5 minutes of running mostly un-loaded. I check the drive belts, nope, not too tight. Just a bad motor.
Even if this machine worked flawlessly out of the box I would only have given it a 4 out of 5 rating. The mortising attachment installation is sort of a cheat and deprives you of stroke length. The belt cover rattles as the machine runs. The table is hard to get very secure to the column. Even after really tightening the clamp the table will move if you bump it.
If I had it to do over I would probably go for the Jet. Unfortunately I fell for the mystique of the Delta name. The jet has a metal pulley cover, where the Delta's is plastic and it rattles. Jet has a built in light socket but I had to buy a magnetic lamp to add to the Delta. The Jet has a TEFC (Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled) motor, where the Delta does not. This is particulary relevant given my bad motor experience. The Jet comes with the mortising attachment, the Delta costs extra. Both are made in Taiwan anyway. I guess the ""Delta days"" are past.
So now I get to find a way to ship this VERY heavy motor to a repair depot somewhere. Not exactly the Delta quality experience I was hoping for. I would go for the Jet next time for sure.
New info 2-13-2002
Delta refused to let me return just the motor. They insist that I ship the 100 lb + head back to them so they can check the serial number. Nice. I decided to drive it to a local repair depot since shipping the head (for a DOA motor) would cost as much as replacing the motor myself!
The saga continues. Apparently all of the shops anywhere near my house or my job have stopped taking on Delta warrantee work. Each one I called had the same story. They tell me that Delta is very hard to deal with and very cheap. (the actual words they used were less polite) Delta doesn't pay market rates for repairs so they stopped taking Delta work. I had to drive my drill press nearly an hours away to get the warantee honored. This has been a dreadfull experience. For your own sake please consider another brand.",3.0
"...You are clamping something larger than a picture frame.  I bought this clamp to hold the four corners of some 1x picture frames I made last summer.

"Before you purchase this bit keep the following in mind, prep and patience are imperative. This is not a bit you can jam in your router and go to town.  To achieve top notch results make sure your stock is square and of same thickness, remember you want a flat surface with no edge gaps. Stock that is not square or of differing thickness will yield poor results.  Before cutting your stock use scrap to set your bit. I use small sections of scrap squared and dimensioned to the same thickness as my project stock. After several trial runs and adjustments I'm ready to go. I use a square to record bit height this makes set up the next time a little faster. If running stock on a router table keep your fence square to the bit, if free hand use a guide. In short, this bit requires careful set up and prep, but then doesn't most wood work?  One last thing, if I'm doing a lot of repetitive panel glue up I use the freud bit. If not I turn to my biscuit joiner or dowels I get excellent results either way. Practice makes perfect!

"I purchased my sawboss a couple of years ago. It's handy to have around. lots of power for its size. It cuts 2x lumber at 45 degrees. I like the dust chute, especially when it's hooked up to a shopvac. So why don't I give  it 5 stars? It doesn't run smoothly. Too much slop in the gears I guess. In  fact ,the main bearing went out and sheared off all the teeth on the arbor.  Porter Cable fixed it alright, but it still runs rough. I bought a Skil 5  1/2"" trim saw for 20.00 at a pawn shop that cuts circles around the  saw boss. You wouldn't believe it since the saw boss has a 9 amp motor and  the little skil is around 6.5 but it's true. New blades, old blades  Pine ,  oak ,plywood it doesn't make any difference the Skil blows it away .It  feels like the skil is gliding through the cut whereas the PC is beating  through with a square blade by comparison. It not only cuts faster, it cuts  smoother due to less blade runout. I thought maybe it was just my saw that  was bad so I tried some others out. Same thing . Fellow sawboss owners, I'm  sorry ,this is all true. If you're looking for a small saw , I recommend  the  5 1/2"" skil. If toolcrib doesn't have it, try the Bosch , it's  the same saw.",3.0
"I am a Wind Turbine Technician.  I go against protocol and buy a lot of my own tools.  If it makes my job easier its worth it.  I have been searching for bag that can keep the wide Varity of tools I carry organized. I purchased this bag because of its 14 inch height.  that seems to be the height requirement to be able to put pliers or screwdrivers in a interior pocket and still close the bag. When I Inspected the layout of the inside of this bag I was disappointed by the interior pockets.  they are very short and either very wide or very narrow.  the narrow ones can hold a 6 inch crescent pretty snug and the wide ones look like they would be perfect for a 16 ft. tape measure.  None are appropriate for Screwdrivers, 8 inch pliers, 8 inch crescents, or channel locks.  there are two taller elastic top pockets  span across either end of the interior that can hold a Varity of tools but do very little for organization. They provide a slightly better spot for tools then floating at the bottom of the bag. Other then the pocket situation this bag has preformed well especially considering the price.

Unfortunately, we dropped it a few times from a height of 2 feet or so to the ground. I would have expected the PLS3 to be more rugged than this since it is used at a construction site - but after it is dropped, it goes way off course by at least 2 feet per 30 feet. The self-levelling feature goes haywire too, and the color of the light won't change even if you tilt it 45 degrees.

The bases  themselves are quite sturdy.  The ""weakest"" point of the base is  in the plastic cambered lever that raises/lowers two wheels in order to  allow movement of the toolstand.  Being plastic the levers do not  ""appear"" to be as sturdy as the rest of the stand and could break  off.  However, that being said, I have NOT had any problem with mine moving  a jointer and a drill press to date. In fact, I am quite pleased with them  and find them to be the most economical, yet acceptable stand available.",3.0

"May not be up to commercial use because some of the hardware is clearly not tough enough to withstand rough handling. On the flipside, it is light enough to be reasonably easy to handle by one self - an asset in home or owner operated shops.

Good value, that is to say if you can actually get one shipped to you in one piece: THE PACKAGING SSUUCCKKSS!!!!! Have had 5 or 6 units show up trashed! For two months, now, I have been unsuccessful at obtaining a second unit to complete a pair - one alone doesn't do me any good.

I thought I was buying an iconic 'made in USA hammer'.  This product is not cheap.  I was disappointed to discover it is actually manufactured in China. This is not mentioned on the product description.  I haven't used it yet so it may be the greatest hammer ever made.  I purchased it also basing my decision on provenance.  I should have bought the Douglas.  I would have sent it back however it would have cost me way to much.  I live in Australia.,3.0

"I picked up both the 14 ounce and 12 ounce versions of this mill-faced titanium Stiletto from a dedicated hammer website.  At the same time, I also bought a 16 ounce Dalluge from Amazon.  The Stilettos were for my boys and the Dalluge was for me.

A year and a house later, and the clear winner is the Dalluge.  Actually it pretty much won right out of the box - it's that good.

The 14 ounce Stiletto suffered a lost magnet early on.  Shortly after that, the handle broke (son's fault - not Stiletto).  Stiletto was good about replacing the magnet for free (while buying a new handle).  My son chose the straight handle as a replacement because he liked my straight Dalluge handle so much.  Of course that's as far as he could go in trying to clone my Dalluge.

-The finish on the handle is still too 'new'.  It still hasn't broke in, even after plenty of use.  The finish is too aggressive.
-The balance of the Stiletto is off in both the 12 and 14.  It just doesn't swing as true as a 16 ounce Dalluge.  I believe Stiletto has a 15 ounce version - maybe this would balance better, maybe not.
-The 16 ounce hits harder, but swings lighter, than the 14 ounce Stiletto.  It's really obvious and again may be due to balance.  It also may have to do with the Dalluge's unique Douglas head/handle mounting system.
-The Stiletto has a big fat nail face that doesn't perform like the flat-top shaped Dalluge.
-The titanium chipped early-on.
-The mill face did not hold up well.  The Dalluge is in far better shape with far more use which included naughty catspaw and flatbar pounding on occasion.
-The Stiletto is 'just ok'.  Far better than a steely, but nothing special other than it is light like all titaniums.

In the market for a new hammer?  Not sure about titanium?  Elbow or shoulder problems, or just don't want problems?  Don't stop here at the Stiletto - there are more titanium hammers to consider.  Check out my extensive review of the Dalluge mill-faced hammer.  Amazon offers it at a great price, and after experiencing both I would recommend checking out the dalluge.  It has reviewed at nothing short of 5-star thus far - and for good reason.

"I own Porter-Cable finish, brad, and framing nailers that are all excellent. Practically no down time while I've finished construction on my house. None of those nailers have had problems with misfiring. The framing nailer needed some maintenance after one year, but the finish nailer has fired over 2500 times without a hiccup. Not so with this brad nailer. It got about five shots off before it started needing two trigger pulls for every staple. Workable, but annoying. I would give my other Porter-Cables five stars each, but this one is only half as good. I don't have any experience with other brands to compare staplers--maybe stapling is harder to do right? Anyway, it gets you there in the end if you're willing to deal with the need for extra shots.",3.0

My shop is fairly small.. so think about that for your setup.",3.0
I've had this nailer for about 3 years now and shot through several boxes of nails.  I've changed my original mark of four stars to three stars. I've been having some major problems with my nailer double shooting.  I haven't had these problems before but they are occuring more often which tells you something about the integrity of the tool.  As a cabinet maker this has caused me a lot of extra work fixing the damage.  Not too mention the danger factor.  Another issue is the fixed exaust port.  It would be nice to ba able to control its direction.  And finally the nails Senco uses have a more round head on them which makes for a bigger hole to fill.  This bigger nail head also tends to spilt the wood more.  I'm putting this nailer on the shelf and looking into Paslode or Bostich.,3.0
Works,3.0
"My coworkers and I have used this stapler for a variety of professional remodeling and construction tasks.  So far, it's been very handy in situations when larger nails or staples wouldn't be appropriate and when finish nails won't hold well enough.  It's amazing how often we find uses for the stapler, and its small size allows it to squeeze into tight situations.

On the downside, we've found that it often misfires (no staple comes out) or fires two staples at the same time.  We're usually firing 1.5 inch Porter Cable staples.  As staplers go, it's a relatively cheap choice that's probably better suited for occasional rather than daily professional use.

I recently bought an Hitachi N3804AB narrow crown stapler that's a bit smaller than the Porter Cable NS150A, but also more solid and powerful.  So far, my coworkers and I prefer the Hitachi over the Porter Cable because it's much more reliable (the only time it ever jammed was when I fired it directly into a steel joist hanger as a test; it has never misfired or fired more than one staple either), it will fit into smaller places because it's about an inch shorter than the Porter Cable, and can sink 1.5 inch staples fully into hardwoods and knots.  It also fires smoothly and doesn't recoil.  The Hitachi is made in Germany so it's ridiculously expensive (I got mine used), but I've been impressed by it's durable all-metal solid feel, simple construction, and ample power.  Best of all, the Hitachi is not even close to as temperamental as another reviewer suggests the Porter Cable is (see below).

Another reviewer suggested five reasons why the Porter Cable stapler misfires.  Since I've used Porter Cable brand staples at 80-90 PSI, these two variables (brand and air pressure) weren't possible causes.  However, the three other possible causes which are sawdust and job site grit, not giving the gun 20 drops of oil per 1000 staples, and not ""gently laying it down"" could all be at play on our jobs.  Here's what I think about these three factors:

The other reviewer works at a cabinet shop that's probably a much more controlled environment than the old houses I have to work in.  I frequently work in the midst of sawdust, plaster dust, drywall dust, concrete and stone dust, mortar grit, metal filings, old cellulose insulation, dirt, rain, snow, and mud and my tools get exposed to all of these things.  That's why I prefer tools that can withstand and function well in the midst of a harsh environment.

Some afternoons I can easily go through 5000 staples, which would mean that I'd need to put 100 drops of oil in my stapler according to the other reviewer's recommendation.  That seems quite excessive to me--I don't even use that much oil in my larger framing nailers, let alone a small stapler.  It's been my experience that it's not very easy to get much more than about five drops of oil simultaneously into the air fitting anyway.  Besides the inconvenience of having to constantly pour oil into the stapler, I prefer not to have a lot of oily residue collecting dust around the exhaust port or on work pieces.

As for not treating the tool gently, I'm guilty as charged.  I don't go out of my way to abuse my tools, but over time they've been accidentally dropped off of ladders or counter tops and have gotten bumped around in the back of my truck.  My tools sometimes get used by other workers and subcontractors (who may or may not take good care of them) because that's occasionally what it takes to keep a job running smoothly and efficiently.  I think that's why some companies design their tools to withstand a certain amount of reasonable, real-world, job site abuse.

I haven't used a Senco, but I've heard they're good as well.  Before I bought the Hitachi, I was going to get a Senco SKS, but now I don't think I'll need it.  The Hitachi seems to have enough power for every situation, plus it's smaller.  It's a bit difficult to find a store that carries the Hitachi 3804AB, but if you look around you might be able to find a used one at an equal or lower price than the Porter Cable NS150A.

Lastly, another reviewer out of hand dismissed all Hitachi nailers as overrated and marketed to younger folks.  I have some Porter Cable tools that I'm happy with and others that I'm lukewarm about.  Likewise some Hitachis are good while others suck (read my review of their NT50AE brad nailer).  I generally think that's the case with most companies that make construction tools nowdays.  You've got to evaluate each tool a company makes and not assume anything, especially now that most US companies are no longer making tools in the US (same thing for German and Japanese companies not producing tools at home).  Plus, aren't Dewalt, Porter Cable, Delta, and Black & Decker all owned by the same parent company now?  The marketing comment baffled me because I've never seen Hitachi tools marketed in places where other companies like Porter Cable were not also marketing their wares.  Most of the Hitachi tools that I've purchased were introduced to me by older (some in their 60's) framers and trim carpenters.  One of my Hitachi nail guns is 20 years old, rusty, and still works flawlessly.  Well, that's my two cents; thanks for bearing with this long review.",3.0

"This mobile base works and does what it's supposed to do I guess.  I purchased a table saw and band saw at the same time and purchased the Jet brand mobile bases for both tools.  They are pricey but so easy to assemble and adjust even after the machine is loaded.  This HTC works well, but I can't say that I'm a fan of having to step on the orange paddles to raise and lower the wheels.  I also don't like how the bars sticks out on the sides and you have to allow for room for the wheels to pop to the sides when the base is in it's stationary position. In a small shop, that extra 6 inches is hard to spare.  There's also about 30 or so screws and nuts you'll have to use to assemble this base from scratch.  This base works just fine if you're concerned about saving some cash.  If I had to do it all over again however, I would probably just go with the Jet base as I did for my band and table saws.  This third base was for a floor drill press that I later purchased.",3.0
"Plastic cam levers broke within 2 weeks of using under a 250 lb machine.  Spend a $5 more and get the PM-1000 version, should last a lot longer.  Everything else on the base is first quality.  Will update the review if HTC sends replacement parts.

kinda cheap compared to competition and I have bought many,3.0

"This thing really is a great design and can be made to fit tools really well.  NOT sure  how well it would fare with really large equipment.
The configuration options are really nice.  It can be screwed to your machine on the bottom with some nice self tapping bolts.

"Mostly this is a good mobile base. It adjusts to fit a lot of sizes and is mostly make of steel. I bought it based on a friend's recommendation.

Then my friend called me one day and said one of the orange plastic cams broke as he tried to lift his table saw onto the wheels. We had to fabricate new cams out of 1/2"" plate aluminum, copying the pivot point and cam surface pattern. HTC just didn't engineer the cams to be strong enough.

As I have the base supporting a much smaller and lighter metal cutting band saw, I don't think my cams will break, but I'm very careful when putting my foot on them, sometimes even lifting the tool to take some weight off it. Once it's in place, everything is great.

Personally, I prefer all four wheels to caster for maximum maneuverability. When only two caster, I am constantly ""parallel parking"" the tool to get it where I want it. Four casters means it goes in any direction. The trick then is to have the four casters lock such that the tool is stable in use. But it can be done.",3.0
"Purchased this to go under a powermatic jointer.  It's well-built and the locking mechanism for the base works extremely well.  Assembly was a bit fussy but I could say that about most of these mobile bases.  My major complaint is the size of the casters provided and the amount of ground clearance they provide.  I work in an older shed on my property and the old concrete floors are not smooth or level.  These casters catch on everything!  Wood chips, shavings, pebbles, cords, you name it.  In addition to this the low clearance under the unit cause it to catch frequently on the padded matts I have around other machines.  If your shop or garage has a nice smooth floor this is a good buy.  But even then keep the floor swept and free of debris.

Pros:
Locking mechanism works very well.
Price is good

Cons:
Assembly is a bit of an annoyance.
Casters do not provide much clearance",3.0

"I agree with Andy, the duplicator is good but the video and instruction manual are completely worthless.  I think the video was shot by a 8 year old who was experimenting with a camera for the first time.  The drawings in the manual are hand-drawn and by somebody that has no business hand drawing.  The manual has been re-copied so many times that much of the text is off the side of the page and therefore doesn't do any good.  Also, my duplicator was missing some bolts and washers that I had to go to the hardware store to buy.  And because the directions were so terrible, it took a few trips and some trial and error to figure out exactly what bolts were needed.  That being said, the duplicator is great once it is set up and will make many beautiful turnings.  I highly recommend using a template rather than an original turning.

Why they didn't just generate a new part number, I do not know. Instead they made a major change in the blade, changing how it behaves and what it can be used for, but kept the part number. Then to ice the cake, they didn't update documentation. Bad decisions at the office.

FYI, here are alternatives if you want an FTG blade. These are 24-tooth, not 40:
LM72M008 silver coating, 1/8"" kerf

"UPDATE

After rechecking all the saw adjustments by the book, I've now ripped some poplar stock, 1-1/2 by 2-1/2.  I had better luck with it.  The blade does try to grab the stock just as it enters the teeth on the back side, though.  You'll hear it as a warning.  Once the blade was fully in the workpiece, I had no further problems.

-----

This blade really is a blessing in most ways for my old DeWalt radial arm saw.  It truly does cut like butter and does not load the saw motor.  It crosscuts better than my older Freud combination blade.

Unfortunately, the blade I received is more prone to kickback than any I've had in years.  It is fine if you are merely shaving the edge of a board, and it might be fine with heavy stock.  But for your own safety, if you're ripping relatively small stock, use featherboards and push sticks, install the anti-kickback fingers, and take every safety precaution.

I ripped the edges of six 2x2 boards and the blade violently kicked back nine times.  It destroyed one work piece.  My saw is square and never had this problem with the older Freud blade.  The lumber was soft pine, straight-grained, and knot free.",3.0
"Bought this mobile base to use with my JET ProShop Tablesaw (325 lbs.).  The assembly was easy and straight forward.  The 1-inch increments on the rail holes worked out fine for the saw legs with the plastic stabilizer feet. Got the base to fit with about 1/4-inch clearance around the legs.  The mobile base isn't as rigid as I thought it would be with the saw installed.  The red plastic cam lifters and casters flex when you step on them to lift the saw.  I can't tell if this is because of the tablesaw leg design or if the base itself isn't that rigid.  It feels as though you have to exert more downward force than I would expect to lift the saw.  As a result I've been lifting the saw as I step on the cam and this works okay.  The rubber feet hold firm and the saw doesn't wonder from the setup position.

This is my first mobile base and even thought the base works I'm not sure why there is as much flex as there is in the frame.  I would probably buy a different brand for the next piece of equipment I want to go mobile.",3.0

I suspected that my saw was poorly aligned, but then I measured a tooth on the blade and found tht each tooth is .104"".  I had a similar experience with the 30 tooth alternate tooth blade from Freud, which is specified as producing a 0.091"" kerf.  If you don't care about the kerf size, the blade is fine.",3.0
"PROS: CHEAP, EASY TO ASSEMBLE, EASE OF OPERATION, STABLE WHEN LOWERED
CONS:LIFT LEVERS ARE WEAK

With the exception of the lift levers, this is a very good product. Maneuvering is easy and the base is very stable when lowered.
I bought this thinking it could handle my 350 pound saw, and it did for awhile. During assembly, I noticed the lift levers were not very robust. If you lift up on the load while stepping on the lever, then this thing might last forever. One of my lift levers broke after one of the few times I forgot to follow my own advice. This was about a year after I purchased it. In place of the lever, I now use a big square shank flat blade screwdriver. It's not pretty, but it works and is not too inconvenient since I move my saw perhaps once a month. I wouldn't recommend this for frequent use or for any machine weighing more than two hundred pounds.",3.0

"This product is well-made, and I certainly wouldn't begrudge them the plastic handles for raising and lowering the wheels: the plastic is very tough stuff, and holds uyp to considerable abuse without any problems. Assembly is very flexible, and doesn't take too long. I mounted a medium-sized drill press on a double-layer of plywood and attached it to this base. It is quite sturdy in the fully raised and fully lowered positions, but the ""in-between"" state is treacherous, and I can't recommend this base for something as top-heavy as a drill press, or anything particularly heavy at all. Once you release one wheel the stand is balanced precariously on three wheels that are well offset from the tool's center of mass, creating a very unstable situation. When you release the second wheel, the tool plops down with a thud that I don't appreciate being applied to an expensive piece of machinery. The levers to engage the wheels do not operate particularly smoothly, and it's difficult to finesse the landing. If you are putting heavy or expensive tools on your stand, I'd think twice before selecting this one. Look for one with a single lever, or one that works by engaging a brake on the wheels.

Pros:
* Well built
* Sturdy in fully raised and fully lowered position
* Relatively easy to assemble
* Inexpensive compared to other options

Cons:
* Unstable when raising and lowering
* Difficult to operate levers (depending on your configuration and weight of tool)
* The ""landing"" is a bit bumpy for my tastes",3.0

"This fence is very fairly priced, and does what it's supposed to do quite well, but mine has a flaw that may or may not be present in others.  When the fence is locked down, the far end moves very slightly towards the blade thus skewing its placement.  The movement is perhaps 1/32nd of an inch at the most, so it may be un-noticeable for many folks.  I have the fence adjusted so it's parallel to the blade when locked, so that isn't a problem.

"I bought this base for use under my bandsaw.  It is reasonably well made and seems beefy enough to support its rated 500lbs.  However, I cannot recommend it due to 3 issues:

1) When the orange levers are actuated they change the height significantly.  My bandsaw was seriously out of plumb and felt tippy when both levers were down.  And when only one was down, it was quite unsteady.

2) The casters must be positioned perpendicular to the frame when not in use, otherwise the wheel interferes with the adjustable foot getting enough weight on it to prevent the base from moving.  You can avoid this somewhat by adjusting the feet to be lower down, but then your base is not level (when sitting on a level floor) in the fixed, use-the-machine configuration.

3) The instructions are horrid, just use the diagrams and common sense.

I didn't see any other reviews here on Amazon about problems 1&2, so I figured I had assembled it wrong, but I double checked and it's just the design.  I solved 1&2 by substituting 4"" wheels, which I happened to have on hand, for the 3"" fixed wheels (not the castered ones).  This allowed me to adjust the fixed feet down another 1/2"", and now the casters can swivel about 270deg without interfering.  But now the casters vibrate noisily when the machine is on...doh!

"First off, I am going to mention that I study human movement and the application of biomechanical forces on the human body at the doctoral level. So I know a bit about forces.

Now again, for the record, I purchased the HTC3000 which has a higher weight capacity and 2 foot stops. I'm writing this review to notify anyone using these base models for a large piece of equipment with a rectangular base, such as a BandSaw, that these bases have poor torsion control. By that I mean, the flat steel side assemblies do a poor job of controling diagonally or sideward place forces. With my 19 inch General band saw, I notice a slight to moderate rocking when I apply lateral forces against the machine. This occurs even with the wheels assembled at the widest configuration. Application of the foot stops on the 3000 model base does nothing to stop the flexing of the frame. I notice the wheel housing assemblies flex also which is not a good sign.

Solution:

1. You could potentially increase support to the base frame rails but the wheel housing assembly flex is another problem all together. Before attempting to correct a problem like that, a tubular steel base would be the better purchase.

2. Another potential solution for this base on a large bandsaw unit could be to attach the mobile base directly to the bandsaw base thus increasing the stabilization. However you would still be left with the wheel housing flex. The flat band steel frame simply does not serve as a good base design for a piece of equipment like a 19 inch bandsaw.

3. A simple solution for increased stability when sawing would be to place two wood wedges under each side of the mobile frame. Sounds good but didn't work when I tested it.

Conclusion: I would not recommend the HTC2000 or the 3000 for tall heavy equipment with a rectangular shaped base.

With these inherent design problems this type of base is really only good for equipment with a generally wider  low center of gravity foot print.

I put a ""Max"" value of $30 on the 2000 model and $40 on the 3000 model. The 3000 model with its higher weight load capacity actually introduces some design flaws and greater instability.

Hope this review helped.",3.0
"While setting up my garage wood shop, I ordered mobile bases manufactured by several different companies for my various machines.  The HTC2000 is easy to assemble with just a few basic tools.  I had reservations at first about the plastic foot levers, but have not had any fail thus far.  HTC's customer's service also seems to be very customer oriented.  While talking with them about another product, I mentioned the reservations I had concerning the plastic levers.  They said there have not been any problems, but if one did fail just to give them a call and they would replace it.

I think the best mobile base for the money is one manufactured by Delta.  It is constructed of welded rectangular tubing and has a single lift pedal.  I have found these to be the most sturdy and convenient to use, but they are only available for just a few of the machines that Delta builds.

Another universal base I really like is available from Woodcraft.  It is nearly as sturdy as the Delta, but has 2 foot pedals and requires the user to furnish a piece of 3/4"" plywood and drill holes for the assembly.

I would eventually like to replace the HTC bases with the Deltas or Woodcraft but I feel confident the HTCs will give satisfactory service until that time.",3.0

"I have this base and the Jet mobile base. I prefer the Jet mobile base over the HTC. I expected more from this one. This one is clunky to assemble, and the exposed bolts on the inside perimeter make the fit seem home-made. This is ok, with a good price, good floor friction, ok castors, and it seems solid enough, but not much thought has been given in the ""shine & polish"" department. If you are planning to use it on something with a high center of gravity, like an enclosed-base bandsaw, consider the slight base ""tip"" when the castors are set down. This might cause the bandsaw to be a bit more tip-able while you are carting it around the garage. Otherwise, I'd recommend spending the extra bucks on one of HTC's beautiful custom bases.",3.0
"I received two of these for Christmas. I put my delt 6"" jointer on one and a Delta 14"" bandsaw on the other. So far the jointer has worked without a problem. The bandsaw is a different story.

After leveling and checking it ,I had the same problem. My only answer was the metal in the frame flexes when the saw is running. Will have to use it on something that doesn't run vertical I suppose.",3.0
Adequate performance for a reasonable price. Assembly is simple and fast. raising the stand up under load is a bit awkward but it does the job. Use with tools that vibrate may incease the vibration. Nothing special. If you're a woodworker you can build your own mobile bases for about the same price.,3.0
"It is a little flimsy compared to my Shop Fox mobile base.  Although this one costs [much] less, so it's not a fair comparison really.  If you have the money, opt for the HTC that is designed for your saw or whatever.
The thing I don't like about this one is that since the wheels are elevated one at a time and the frame is made of flat stock it twists a little as you raise your machine.  If you don't have your open stand equipment super tight, it will knock the legs out of level.  Nothing dangerous or big, just a little disconcerting.
If you just can't bear to spend the extra money, this is a good choice.  Just remember the weight limit. (300 lb.)",3.0

I bought this bit as it is equivalent to a 35mm bit used to install standard cabinet hinges.  One problem is that you must guage the depth as the bit is not the standard thickness. Generally when a forstner bit reachs the depth where the top of the drill head is level with the surface of the wood the depth is correct for consealed hinges; not so with this product.  The thinner head also tends to walk a bit if you are not using a drill press so you must be careful to line the bit up 90 Deg to the wood surface.  This bit will do the job but if you must  make alot of holes without the aid of a drill press don't even think about it! The bit seems sharp but doesn't have the normal saw tooth cutting edge around the periphery and because of that I tend to think that perhaps this tool won't stay as sharp as long.,3.0

"I ordered two of these meters as I personally like the analog scale rather than having to wait for a digital meter to settle down.  But one of the meters would not zero out.  As I got to looking at it while I getting ready to re-package it for return, I noticed the scale indicator was raised on one side and was binding on the needle.  I was able to lift the clear cover and get the board re-aligned to solve that problem.  I then checked the meters against one another to make sure the readings were the same.  I also compared them with a digital to see if all agreed as well.  Hopefully they will retain their accuracy over time..",3.0

It has a compartment for a AA battery but it works fine reading voltages without it. I just blew the fuse in it doing something dumb and was surprised to see the back panel has instructions with the part number of the fuse.",3.0

This review is basically  for the last one I bought which only lasted two years.  My first timer lasted at least 20 years and was becoming noisy but still working so I ordered another one. The second timer I bought in 2016 and it only lasted two years and became very very noisy but still working. This is my third timer and after installation it is very quiet. Hopefully it will remain that way. These  are basically good timers but should last more than two years . I have read other reviews  about their timers  becoming very noisy also. Other than that they are very good timers if you get a good one.,3.0
"I needed ceiling light fixtures for my remodeling job in my basement that could be turned off at the fixture due to the odd circuit for that room and 2 wall outlets that we had to install in a fuse box in my old house.

I received the box of the two square glass light fixtures and electrical parts by UPS and I set aside the box until my electrician could install them.  Unfortunately I should have checked the packing as the glass shade of one was intact and the second fixture packed on the bottom was in many pieces from the shipment.  We did not discover this until too late to do anything about it, I believe, and rather than send back the entire light fixture and remove what was installed on the ceiling already without the shade part, I found an identical replacement glass shade at the local ""used fixtures"" store for $5. The original shipment of the two fixtures came from an ACE Hardware warehouse distributor in Brooklyn, NYC where the storm just hit and they are probably not in a position to replace anything right now, if they are even open!!!",3.0
"I needed a light fixture which has a pull down chain to put up my living room ceiling as the wiring doesn't turn on/off from the wall, but is tapped into an outlet.

Looking at the reviews of this unique light fixture with the pull down chain at the center of the fixture and not to the side, I decided give this a try.  With this chain, there isn't the feel of resistance that one gets with many of the pull down chains that are located at the side of the fixture.

The rest of the ceiling light figure is simple.  The fixture takes two standard base bulbs. 60W max bulbs.  The light cover is about 12 inches square and frosted white. I am using two LED bulbs made by Phillips that put out equals to 60W (around 800 lumens for each bulb).  I also replaced the lightshade with a more transluscent one that allows more light to pass through.

I'm happy with the results. There's enough light at passes through, I don't expect to have to climb up a ladder and change the bulbs as they are LED bulbs and the pull chain works great!

Update (11/18/12):

I updated my rating from 5 stars to 3.  After only about 3 months, the pull down switch got jammed and stopped working.  I didn't mistreat the switch by pulling on the chain too roughly.  Perhaps I just got a lemon.  I'm not sure, but decided against buying another one (what's to stop another one to stop working again after a few months?) and bought a different fixture instead.",3.0
Once a month I just stops working,3.0
"The screw holes in the base do not match up with holes in the ceiling box.  I could only screw it in on one side which seems to hold well enough.

Also, this is made of very flimsy, thin metal.  The whole thing seems like it is going to fall apart while screwing in the bulbs. But it didn't. And since I'm using LED bulbs, I'll probably not have to change bulbs except for maybe one more time in my life.

And another note, it hangs down lower than the same looking one in my foyer which is 3"", and this one is 4"", but makes a big difference in a small room since the bulb is viewable and not diffused by the glass on the sides which causes eye burn in if you happen to be looking at it when you turn it on.

Other than that, it works for its intended purpose and looks better than the single bulb that was hanging from the ceiling before.",3.0

"This is the first time I've hated something so much, I immediately removed it after installing it. For one. the base is too small, so if the hole cut in the ceiling is bigger than the box, it won't sit right. There is not much curve to the glass cover and it sits much lower than I thought it would, so it doesn't cover the bulbs, and as such blinds me every time I turn the light on. The pullchain mechanism seems very sturdy however os if that is your main concern, then this is the light for you.

 I thought this would be a nice alternative to the globe-styled lights, but I was wrong. In the pictures it looks nice and sleek, but once installed, it just looks bad imho.

 I'm giving three stars because it does function as intended, so that isn't an issue. My problem is with the design and aesthetic of it.",3.0

That said, the sensors do ok and if you use light bulbs these will last a while (at least 3-4 years).

"EDIT - I see some weekend warriors don't know their facts. I use snips almost every day, read my link in the comments or don't, but don't try to tell people that casting is superior. It is cheaper, and that's the only reason some companies prefer it. Back to the review -

Word is that Wiss has switched from forging to casting, which is not desirable in this application. Whatever the reason, these do not hold up like better brands anymore. I've seen several Wiss bite the dust on identical material which I chewed right through with my Midwest snips, also US made. Wiss is not up to the standard they once were. Additionally, the blades will not stay tight despite the nylon locknut, I'm constantly retightening them.

Chances are if you're looking at a pair of these as opposed to offset snips, these would suit your needs just fine, but I'd still recommend the Midwest version, about the same price, and they'll be there when you need to cut something heavier.",3.0

"We purchased this and had it installed professionally in the basement utility room - to power the water heater. This timer switch worked great for about 3 weeks, and then it started making a ticking sound that began getting louder and louder. After 3 more weeks it was so loud we could hear it upstairs in our living room when we were trying to relax at the end of the day. After a power failure that lasted more than 4 days, the ticking sound was gone - the switch behaved like it had at the beginning. However, after another few days, the ticking sound returned. I looked inside the unit, and found some black metal powder, which indicates to me that something is grinding and wearing down. Maybe this is a defective unit - I don't know - but the ticking sound was intermittent. Note that this is rated for residential use, so we're not using it for the wrong application. We eventually had this unit replaced with the electronic dpst version by intermatic. I'll be in touch with the manufacturer to see about a refund and will post the results of that here.",3.0

The pros:
+ Good product reviews.
+ Priced right & the shipping was free.
+ Good quality tool.
+ Does a pretty good job of cutting straight & slightly to the left or to the right.

The cons:
- Actually designed for straight cuts, so it can only cut slightly to the left or to the right.

Closing thoughts:
Looking back, I bought these thinking I'd have the best of both worlds... a left, straight & right cutting snips!  I was wrong, as these are designed for straight cuts, but can cut slightly to the left & sightly to the right.  For tight left or right cuts, you need a Wiss red handle M1 (left) or a Wiss green handle M2 (right).  I have since purchased a Wiss green handle M2.  Now I have all 3, so I'm ready for anything! :)

I wanted to really like this square and was hoping to get the powder coated one like everyone mentioned getting. I did end up getting the powder coated version but to my dismay some of it pealed off during the removal of the label sticker. Not a huge deal as things are scraped and marred during construction. The powder coating also throws off the scribe notches but about a millimeter or so. My biggest gripe was how the T edge was either not machined exactly or the power coat had built up enough to where it has a slight rock when butted up against an edge. The pivot doesn't have a crisp edge either. Most of the issues are minor and it is still usable. I just wouldn't count on it for really precise work.,3.0
This was a replacement pool timer. I ordered this one because my old timer had a grounding wire post&screw. This newer one does not have a similar grounding post but a green screw to ground wires. The other timer brands at Home Depot and Lowes are similar. I only replaced the timer mechanism to avoid the work of regrounding the wires to the green screw. If you want to replace the whole timer box check other brands as the prices were similar. I you want to replace the timer mechanism only from a similar box this will work fine.,3.0
"Being a professional electrician I was looking for channel locks that can do 2 inch conduit. These cant. They slip when you try to tighten couplings and connectors giving you a nice bloody knuckle. The jaw opening is big enough but not deep enough, which I think is a design flaw. If you need to run 2"" conduit with compression couplings, I heard Klein is the better choice. I will keep these as I can still use them to hold the conduit but I will order Klein equivalent.",3.0
It does the job but I have my doubts as to how it will hold up to the weather and sun.  It seems kind of light weight in construction.  I also had to use a lot of silicone caulking around the base as the thin gasket supplied with it just did not seal the gap between the light and the wall.,3.0
T101R Worked good for almost three years then all of a sudden stopped working and keeping time. Went to several forums online and saw many people had the same problem as I have. Still can not fix it but will probably have to replace it since it is out of warranty already.,3.0
"I have owned this bolt cutter for 5 years and have cut a lot of 3/8 inch rebar with it. The last piece I almost cut must have had a hard spot, so I put the handle on the ground and leaned into it as described in the directions.  I broke the handle, but I was not too upset since I'd never had a problem with the cutters before.  I called Cooper Tool (HK Porter) and was told they do not have replacement handles.  Apparently, if you break the handle you were not ""using the tool in the way it was designed.""  ""No problem, I'd like to buy for another one or tell me who sells them.""  ""No, we don't have replacement handles, you cannot buy one.""  The interesting part is you can buy replacement heads everywhere, but not handles.  I'd like to meet the genius who thought up this policy.",3.0
"I didn't like the looks of the non-stainless hardware and loose-fitting plastic pieces of this product.  So I bought some marine-grade sealant at the boat store and dressed it up where the rain, snow, ice and bugs might have gotten in.

Otherwise the unit works as expected.  Have gone from halogen capsule to LED floodlamps, greatly reducing the electrical load on the switching relay in this unit.  That should make it last longer.  Since it's a mechanical relay, not an electronic relay, yes, the unit does work with LED or other ballast-based lamps.",3.0
Was expecting better tolerances & quality. Had to order the Tekton version instead.,3.0
"Ive owned several of these, since they are suppose to be ""the best"" on the market. The first one I received, one of the screws holding the tip on were in crooked and stripped out so it never tightened on right.

In my opinion this tool is sub par. With my current tool, it does heat quickly, but for some reason every 10 minutes of use I have to re-tighten the screws due to loosening, or perhaps carbon buildup. This is quite inconvenient and after you unscrew it a dozen times the alloy body strips out and needs to be re-tapped with larger threads.

I like my new 'home tapped' threads better anyways because with the larger screws, it hold tighter, and loosens up less often.

The high setting is also a pain to use since you have to hold the trigger in half way to activate it. This is uncomfortable and cramps my fingers very quickly. Its also counter-intuitive having the high setting at half pressed in and low at fully pressed.

I'm not all squawk though, I'm more about making things better, so IMO; the design should include a better tightening system for the tips, and a switch on the side of the body for switching between high and low rather than holding the trigger in half way.",3.0
"The photo is not the same as the item received. The motion sensor is molded into the housing and not removable. I bought this with the intention of removing the motion sensor and attaching it to a light fixture that I already have. Unfortunately what you get is not the same as the photo - the sensor on this item is molded into the plastic and not removable. It's quite the cheap plastic junk, but if all you care about is that it does it's job - then it's fine for the 10 bucks.",3.0
"First unit I was sent didn't work at all; a big waste of time and effort. Second one seems fine so far. Be careful about positioning lights as directed; won't work if positioned too close to sensor, not to mention the fire hazard if lighs are aimed at anything too close! Limited directions lights can aim; seems cramped, too near sensor.",3.0
"Had to buy a new outlet box to make this work. Guess that isn't the fault of the light. But just a huge pain. Its kind of flimsy so I wouldnt put this out where it will get beat by the wind or southern sun, but under a carport it works just fine.",3.0
"I guess you get what you pay for.  The mounting holes didn't line up with the fixture this was replacing, so I had to drill new holes (could have bought an adapter plate, but I didn't). The four screw holes must be drilled out to install.  The screws and wiring nuts that came with the light were worthless--screws are too short and nuts are far too small to fit on 12-gauge wire.

Works fine once I installed it. Sensor is sensitive enough for my application (about 10 ft up on the side of my garage) and able to cover directly below the light out to the edge of the cement pad (about 15ft) and to both sides.  Used with CFL flood lights, and it works fine.",3.0

"Please note that I only bought one of these, so it is possible it was a defective one.

The mounting arms on this didn't seem as though the screw holes were large enough.  It was almost impossible not to strip the screw heads when tightening them down, because of the extreme amount of resistance.  I've used a lot of these from other manufacturers and this is the first time I've had this type of issue.  It wasn't a bargain price either, so I expected better quality.",3.0
"Screws are not long enough to accommodate thick drywall.  In places where I had double-thick drywall, I had to replace the blue flaps with toggle bolts that I purchased separately.  They worked OK in single-thickness drywall locations.  They should offer this product with longer screws available.  I have seen a few forum discussions online where other contractors complained of the same thing.

Also, the hard plastic ridges (there are 3 parallel ridges visible on the inner top and bottom surfaces) got in the way of my outlet that I was installing (Leviton 689-W 15 Amp 1-Gang Recessed Duplex Receptacle).  Essentially, I had to shorten the ridges a bit by gouging them out with a hand tool.  Wish this product was thought through a little better and wish there were better options because one size does not fit all in the real world.",3.0
"These mechanical Intermatic timers tend to be reliable and long-lasting, but I received a defective sample (not from here) with a strange manufacturing defect where the metal backing plate for the motor and gears was bent at the factory because of incorrect assembly - see photo.  The bend lets the unit wobble a bit inside its steel box but more importantly prevented the grounding screw from going into the hole just under it in the plastic, making it easy to crack the plastic, strip the screw hole, and prevent a good ground connection, leading to a potential electric shock hazard.

The ground screw is not particularly convenient when you have a cut in the ground wire and need 2 connections, but there is plenty of room in the bottom of the box for wire splices.

This model accommodates both 3-wire and 4-wire (separate neutral and ground) household wiring.",3.0

"After months of flawless operation, my wife and I noticed a burning plastic smell emanating from the garage. Apparently, one of the jumper wires came loose and was arcing to the point that it overheated and melted the wire insulation and innards of the switch. I am notorious for overtightening everything to the point that I often break things, so I don't fault myself. You can read reviews of other buyers that had the same issue. Luckily, Intermatic sent me a replacement with no trouble at all. My prophylactic approach with the new switch was to buy thicker and stranded copper wire from Lowe's to replace the included jumper wires. I then ensured that I fully tightened the wires again. I noticed that the first switch was always warm, but I thought that was normal. I no longer have that issue.",3.0

good functionality' but display too small to read easily.,3.0
"The flaw in this unit is that the battery has to be good to use it in auto or manual. If the battery is bad you can not turn it on even though there is power to the unit. It only uses 1 AA battery so there is little reserve.  Each time you replace the battery it must be reprogrammed.
So when hubby is away fishing and the family has no hot water, even pressing the ON button will not work.
I updated this after writing this review as it reminded me to replace the battery in my other older unit. When I did the cheap plastic battery holder fell apart. I called Intermatic and told them it was far out of warranty but they were nice enough to send me a new battery holder free.
I have installed several of these for friends and they do work well except that it is totally reliant on a 1.5V battery. The relay should be powered by the 240V side so even if the battery is dead you can manually override.",3.0

"I would not recommend this item anymore, because workmanship has deteriorated. I purchased my first one of these back in early 1999. It was still working well, when I sold the house in late 2001. Upon moving into my current house, I bought another in Feb 2013. After one year, the timing mechanism did not keep proper time, so I bought another one, based on my very first experience. This last one also developed the same timing issue one year later. I am now trying the electronic version, the EH40. Another thing to note pertains to the on/off lever that is supposed to stick out of the slot in the front of the door. With both of the last two, the lever did not sit clear of the door, so it could not be moved properly by the internal mechanism. That wasn't an issue for me, because of where I mounted it. I just folded the lever part way back in and left the door ajar. However, this could be a problem, if you need to mount it in a area requiring the door to be closed for safety reasons.",3.0

If the Battery (AA) gets week then the timer will not work.  Should have designed the timer were the battery is only used in power outages not as a requirement for the timer to function.,3.0
"So far it works fine.  I'm only rating it 3 stars for the following reasons:
1. It arrived damaged, but it clearly wasn't damaged in shipment. There is a plastic part inside that holds the timer in place in the metal box which was broken.  I initially was going to return it, but I was able to bend the metal clip to hold the timer securely.
2. The LCD screen is tiny and of very low contrast.  Even in a room with a window and 80 watts of fluorescent light directly overhead I needed a flashlight shining directly onto. the LCD to read it.
3. Most importantly, the instruction manual is very poor regarding installation, and my package included an insert of a wiring diagram that didn't match the wiring diagram on the plastic insulation cover. I compared it multiple times.  The unit it self is labeled thusly:
1 = Line 1, 2=Line 2, 3=Line 1, 4=Load 1, 5=Line 2, 6=Load 1.
The insert has the first 2 reversed, and shows jumping 1 to 5 and 2 to 3.
I followed the instructions I found here: http://waterheatertimer.org/How-to-wire-EH40-hot-water-heater-timer.html
So far it seems to work fine.

My overall impression is that this is very cheaply built using the cheapest components possible.

On the plus side it's cheap, and the box has plenty of room to allow for wire nut connections if you need to go from stranded to solid or something.  Programming is straightforward.

I got an all in one conduit / 3 10 AWG conductor kit from the local hardware store.  Unfortunately it turned out to use stranded wire, which isn't really safe for the screw terminals in this timer, and if you try to put stranded on one side and solid on the other of a single terminal on side will not be secure.  I got about 1ft of solid 10 AWG cut into 4"" lengths and wire nuts to go from the stranded to solid into the screw terminals, wrapping each with plenty of electrical tape to ensure no shorts.  tl,dr: Make sure you use solid 10AWG to hook up to the screw terminals.

Personally I'd probably get a better unit from another manufacturer if I had to do it all over again.  Intermatic should really consider upping the quality of these devices - I'd pay more for a better device.",3.0

Works as it should. The jumpers should be a bit longer and since most users are going to need the jumpers they could come pre installed for an extra star.

"This is my 2nd timer.  My first one was a GE and lasted three years.  It is no longer available so I bought The Intermatic EH240.  My wife and I have it set so it runs 2.5 hours in the morning and we have more than enough hot water for the rest of the day.  On the weekends she does laundry so it keeps the water heater on for 5 hours and then turns off.  There is no reason to keep a water heater running 24 hours in our situation.  It saves us about $3.50 a month on our electrical bill.  These timers should last for a minimum of 10 years.  If they only last 3 years it is cost effective but  I  will buy a old fashioned timer instead of the electronic timer if this one fails in 3 years or less.  I gave it 3 stars because of the number of reviews where the timer failed in 2 or 3 years.  I will update this review in a couple of years if the timer lasts that long.  In our area, New Mexico, the price of electricity increased this year so our savings should increase.  I should mention that the first timer I receivved from Amazon was dead on arrival.  They quickly shipped another it works fine.",3.0

It does not mean that you can set 42 discrete cycles.

I need at least 19 discrete cycles for my application, and am returning the timer. Other that the misleading product information, the timer appears to be a good one for many applications.",3.0

Installed immediately.  Had to go on line to clearly understand how to wire.  I am not an electrician.  Once online a color image of box with how each wire was connected helped me Tremendously.  A breeze to wire.  Turns on and off perfect.  As that's what it's suppose to do. It's a switch box that turns the water heater on and off.  The box I received the metal door latch to secure door seems to be welded to the side could not close.  Something was obviously wrong with the latch.  Did not return because it works.

"Pros - Battery backup for the timer, easy to operate and program, no mechanical pins or levers to work lose, worked as described.
Cons - As a homeowner I could not understand the wiring directions, I went online and found some that a user had posted and it was an easy install.  The unit failed in 15 months (it has a 12 month warranty). Intermatic says the backup battery will last approx. 2 years, it out lasted the timer!

"Purchased a Intermatic electronic timer back in 2002 for my water system recirc pump.  It finally died so I ordered this one to replace since it the same only newer.  When I received the timer it had basically the same look except for the plastic window which is nice.  However, when I went to program the timer I thought the digital display had too small and narrow letters/numbers.  My old timer had a letter/number display that was at least twice the size.  Almost had to get a magnifying glass to program the unit.  The other problem (I think) has to do with the ""Event"" button which I had to press numerous times for it to operate.  I do not know if it is defective or just hard to punch to get it to work.  I finally programmed the unit and it works just fine for turning the pump on and off at the desired times. Just seems now days that merchandise is being built a little too cheaply for the price we pay.

2014 Jan update:  This unit has lost programming numerous times in the past 6 months and I have had to call Intermatic support numerous times.  They sent me a filter to place across the load as they implied that a small pump could cause the problem.  Even though the original timer operated the same pump.

One vial was somehow, stuck, meaning, it took a lot to make the bubble move. Therefore, the level isn't very sensitive, and therefore, not very accurate. This one's going back, and I'll just stop trying to cut corners, and get a Stabila.",3.0
"Intermatic has done me wrong in the past with a mechanical water heater timer. My fault, I didn't install it on time to find out it didn't work. This one is relatively foolproof and it's fully electronic. Make sure you get the true voltage. This one is a 120V, I had to send it back and get the 220V version, but it works great. So it would have been a 5 but I ate the mechanical timer.",3.0
The instructions are absolutely the worst.  I don't do electrical work often but I know enough.  BUT when they have instructions and then an addendum (a business size piece of paper that looks like a three year old cut it out) it completely contradicts the main instructions.  It took me to consult with an electrician to figure out which would be the safe way.,3.0

"I am a previous owner of a WH21 timer by Intermatic that's why we ordered another  b/c its simple to wire, we used this model about 10 years then had to replace with another different model and were disappointed  with yellow timer dial ....

I thought I was going to have to return item, after wiring it up today b/c the light stayed on and timer did not keep time. The over ride did not work ! My husband who is an experienced all around DIY .... this timer had him ready
to throw it out in the yard !

The knock outs to run the wire up thru are small as others mentioned

My best advice is look at the screw terminals there's 3 on the lower part of the metal timer box with timer box open and facing you to make this easier you may want to mark the outer screws right and left ....  and consider which side your main power line is coming from ( breaker box) and which side your hot water heater wires are on.

**** TIP
Make sure you attach breaker wires and hot water heater wires to the correct side of terminals in order for device to work properly.

Tip
TakIng one black wire from breaker box goes on one outer screw, then take black wire from hot water heater and connect it on the opposite side

Take white wires (hot) one each from breaker box and hot water heater and attach one to each side of the middle screw without touching each other

Then take both ground wires and connect those to the ground screw over on the right of the 3 terminals.

If your timer does not work or our light stays on, reverse the black outer wires, just make sure you only have 1 on left and one on the right ...the way ours wired up was opposite of the included diagram. Also make sure the wires are connected good to the terminal screws making a good connection.

Because the wiring was the opposite than described I am giving it a 3
it should have better instructions and trouble shooting tips.

Our hot wires were white ... yours maybe different

Always make sure to turn off power before starting projects",3.0
"I do not like to leave negative reviews but want to confirm what some others have said here, I purchased this unit one year ago, after one month one of the brass legs that is to shut it off seamed to cause problems so instead of it coming on a couple of times a day I now had the optition of only one on/off per day , I couldn't see why it looked exactly the same as the other one, now one year later the same thing is true of the other one and I realized it is the unit itself has a problem on the plastic leg that meets the on off legs on the back of the black knob. It is tooooo soft and has worn a radius edge on it and now it won't shut off anymore......................... very poor service from Intermatic on this model................

"I installed this product 2 years ago on my electric hot water heater.  It is pretty easy to install if you have knowledge & comfort around 220V electricity.  While it worked, it was excellent-- very flexible programming.  Surely it saved us quite a bit of money.  The question is, did it save enough to pay for itself in 2 years?  Because that's how long it lasted.  One of the two relay switches has failed, so although the clock and ""power"" light still work, it will no longer turn on the water heater (I tested it throughly before coming to this conclusion.)  I'm ordering a new one, because I liked it so much until now.  I considered replacing it with the mechanical version, but those seem to have longevity issues, too.  Bottom line:  If you think this can save you $35 a year or more, it's worth it.  Otherwise, probably not.",3.0

"The directions say maximum AWG10 wire size. I would think that AWG12 would be a more likely limit and, don't think about joining any wires with wire nuts; there's just not enough room in box. Even without any wiring interference alignment of the on/off switch and the opening in the box cover do not align well enough to be able to operate the switch with the cover closed.  The same could be said for the ""power on"" light in the upper right hand corner which, with the door closed, one has to search in order to align the cover's peep hole with the light inside. Also be aware that with the door open, you have only a thin plastic cover at the bottom separating you and 220VAC connections. Be careful! This is not the first Electric Water Heater Timer I have owned; I have another one for my main water heater that has worked faithfully for past than 25 years.  I don't think this one is a robust and reliable as my original one. We will see! I found the assembly directions a bit ambiguous but, as with most things coming from China these days, that is probably to be expected.",3.0
"I just finished installing the timer. I purchased 8 feet of #10 2-wire with ground (I only used about 5 feet). The water heater is wired to 220 volts. The problem with #10 wire is that it is stiff and so hard to work with. The three timer terminals are small and there is just a small ridge of plastic between them so I had to twist the wires & make sure that the wires went in perfectly so there would be no shorting. The timer could have had a longer screws & wider spaces for the terminals which would have made it a lot easier for me - that's why I only gave it 3 stars.
Otherwise it's just a timer that I use for 2 on periods, 9:30 to 11 am and 6 to 8 PM.",3.0
"I finally got around to installing this thing last weekend. So I haven't had it long enough to make any comments as to the amount of money I have/will save. What I can tell you though is this box is TIGHT. Not 'tight' meaning ""Damn that tricked out Mustang is tight!"" I mean tight like there is hardly any room in the box to make your connections.

If you are hooking up a small water heater that uses #12 wire it will be OK. But I had a hard time fitting #10 in there. There just wasn't enough room to bend the wire and hook it up to the terminal screws. I managed to do it eventually, but there was a lot of cussing involved.

So if you like getting mad and frustrated while installing things go with the WH21. Knowing what I know now....I would buy the WH40. It looks to have a larger space for your wires.",3.0

"I bought this brush (2.5"" XL Dale) at a local paint store, and I have not found it well-suited to my needs. The main problem is that it doesn't flow paint out to the tip very well. For example, if you're cutting in the wall along window casing or other trim, the bristles might actually be sliding along the edge of the trim (and leaving traces of paint on the trim), but leaving the paint on the wall an eighth or sixteenth inch away--and this is when the brush is full. Also, because of the thin handle style, this brush does not hold much paint.

Another small gripe I have is that the ferrule has sharp square corners that are uncomfortable to hold.

Overall, Purdy is probably the best brand of brushes I have used. It could be that this one I bought was not constructed correctly--and individual defect rather than a bad design.

But I wish I had bought a Nylox 100% nylon for fine cutting in and ease of cleanup.",3.0

"This fan was an easy DIY retro install. It could use the fold down mounting tabs on all four sides to increase the stability for certain installs but over all the install went fine. One thing that I did notice and the reason for my three star rating was that the damper door does not fully close when the unit is mounted. I noticed this as I had assembled it on my kitchen table before I installed it. My concern is that it will let the air from inside the house to filter outside as from what I can tell it vents to an eve as its a half bath. I called tech support to see if the damper that I received was faulty but, the tech who seemed knowledgeable about the product assured me that the damper was not faulty but, was designed that way intentionally. The reason that the damper does not fully close was to let the heat that was generated from a possible 100 watt incandescent bulb to ventilate properly. This is mainly for installations that separate the light from the fan which would allow the light to be on while the fan was off. This definitely needs to be redesigned for today's low heat LED bulbs. I really feel like I am heating the neighborhood to a certain extent! Overall i feel that the fan moved enough air for the space that I installed it in and the noise level was as expected for a budget exhaust fan.",3.0

After all, it's only about 6 inches long so that is basically the amount of post you are leveling. I used it to set the post and get it in the ball park, then finished the job using a 4' level for more accuracy. If you're using it for setting deck posts or something that only stick out of the ground a few feet, it would be fine. For tall posts though, us a more accurate level for the final positioning. Using this level initially did help though, so I would recommend it. Good enough buy for the money.",3.0

"This is the exact timer that I've used for several decades. It is mechanical and simple to set, and completely reliable in my experience.

The rated capacity is 15 amps, 1750 watts, more than sufficient for my typical usage - one or two room lamps at 60-100 watt each (and these days, with fluorescent and now LED lamps pulling considerably less electric current, the capacity is just that much greater than what is being demanded from it.

There are some practical limitations to be aware of in using this 'old-style' timer:

- the settings are not precise. The dial that is used to set the current time, and to set the on and off times, is fairly course and probably only accurate to approximately 5-10 minutes at best.
- there is no battery backup. The timer stops working any time the power is off, and it's then necessary to remember to adjust the time again when power is restored, or the timer settings will no longer be correct.
- it is limited to two different on-off settings per day, although additional times can be added simply by purchasing a package of 'trippers' (this listing on Amazon looks like the right product:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intermatic-Timers-Plastic-Tripper/dp/B00GJYEDXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intermatic Timers Plastic Tripper</a>&nbsp;-- HOWEVER even better is to go directly to the Intermatic website where these trippers can be purchased for 12 cents each!).
- it does not automatically adjust for daylight savings time, or for the different lengths of the day in winter vs summer, so those adjustments must be done manually throughout the year.
- it is noisy. The timer is a gear driven clock, basically, and you can easily hear it operate if the room is quiet. It may not be what you want to have plugged in to the lamp in your bedroom, for example.
- it is intended for indoor use only.

This style timer has been produced for many years. Intermatic now has much more sophisticated models, and if I was going to purchase a timer today, I would not purchase this older TN711 model but I would rather select something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intermatic-DT620-Digital-Plug-In-Timer/dp/B004TGO6RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intermatic DT620 Digital Plug-In Timer</a>, that is far more capable and addresses each of the points I've listed above that are deficiencies of this old model timer.

"I ordered a tan zytel case medium stockman and I was very disappointed in the finish and the blades. The springs in the back and the liners were not smooth. they were each at different heights instead of flush. The zytel scales themselves also appeared to be uneven in thickness. Blades were not that sharp, grinds were not symmetrical on some of the blades, and you could see a definite burr or roll on the edges of two knives. Scales had two impact or injection mold marks that weren't sanded down. This was purchased new, for American made it should of never been shipped like that. I read other reviews on the large zytel stockman and they had the same complaint. Not sure if this is happening just with the zytel models or what but I know Case had periods in the past where their quality control was poor.

It wasn't all bad though. Very light weight, satin ""as ground"" finish which I like over the chrome style finishes. Did end up sending it back.",3.0
I have decided I don't like small and medium-sized stockman patterns. Too small and too many blades in something that small as well as lots of blade rub. The two bladed pen knife makes more sense and its smaller and thinner!,3.0
I love case knifes they are always what I keep in my pocket . This one is to replace one I lost that have had for about 10years . This knife is identicle to the one I had before. The only reasons I give it three stars are the blades edge is pretty rough ( to look and touch) and the opening/closing action needs some oil .,3.0

"The first time I purchased this (years ago) I was able to figure out how to install it on my faucet. It took a while but it eventually worked. The water was distinctively better tasting than my Brita. Years since, I had to buy a new one because it fell apart. I wasn't too disappointed by that because it worked for years. This second time around, for some reason it wouldn't fit properly and I couldn't get it to work. Had to give it away.",3.0

"we actually had a plumber/neighbor help us make this work, get what you pay for I guess. it does not stream right but its on there so tight now (plumber tools) so it doesn't leak, before it was spraying water and leaking everywhere. would not buy this again. I'd fork out more money.",3.0

". I farm for a living and I'm lost if I don't have my number  5wr in my carring pouch (35 years and counting}. I use them as a clamp, cut wire , or a adjustable wrench. The only complaint I have is where they are made .... China .. They used to be made in Dewitt Nebraska for 70 years and employed 330 people from a town with a population of 600. The workers were not over paid BUT the new owner thought they could make more money in China { They bought Rubbermaid and did the same }... I orderd 15 and was HOPING that MAYBE I would received the last of the American made vice grips. No Luck all Chinese . If a Amercan company makes a similar product to vice grips I'll buy from them .",3.0

"This review is really about the box that they come in which is really a waste of cardboard and paper (before you flame me and say this is not the right venue, I mean the product box not the Amazon shipping box) .  They came packed in a flat box four layers of 12 each with heavy paper separating them.  Not sure who the target market is for this but I don't find this useful at all, unless you have shelf space to lay it flat without anything on top of it I don't think it's going to work for you.  I put them in a gallon baggie and threw the box in the recycle.  If this was the only issue I wouldn't be writing this but they also put a UPC sticker on the foam of each brush.  Again, not sure who they are aiming at (perhaps resellers?), but I don't find it useful to pull the label off of each one before I use it (or in my case before I repackage it for storage).  As far as the brushes go I would have rated them 5 star as they are what I expected: cheap, foam brushes that I can throw away after each use not a lot else to say about them.",3.0
"I bought one (actually, I'm on my second one), and found it very easy to install; I was able to enjoy filtered water for several months.  Now, however, the unit just falls off my faucet.  I replace it back on the faucet (with the handy tool you need to mount it...glad I kept it this second time), and it stays about a week, only to fall off again.  It fell off again this morning, so I am going to Menards today to look at a different brand.  I used PUR before I moved to my current location, and never had a problem.  I chose this one because it was less expensive.  The first one leaked all the time; now I'm on my second one...so it's not really cheaper.",3.0
"So close to great and so many things that will anger you about the product.

Beautiful out of the package.  This thing looks like it belongs on your chrome faucet.  Great looking design

That is until you pick it up, and realize its chrome plated plastic.  That's fine in itself, but connections to a sink should never be plastic (-1)

Ok so lets goto installation.  They include a nice tool that works well.  They include a variety of shapes and sizes of adapters, as they should.  Now just to read those instructions.

Wait, big washer, small washer, medium size sounds fine, but when I look at them they are all basically the same size.  I open up the filter cartridge to have plastic o-rings pop out with white plastic adapters, and the instructions say nothing about ANY of this (-1).

What you'll have to do is use the internet to figure out this product.  Damn shame for a relatively nice product.

So here's your assembly.

Faucet w/o aerator
-
Grey Plastic Adapter WITH O-ring black installed (on the bottom side, the top side should not need one, only one of the o rings should fit)
-
a red o-ring
-
large black o-ring under red o-ring (may not be necessary if you use one of the other adapters, for the larger one for interior threaded faucets I had to use both to get a seal)
-
Actual filter device

Now on the filter you'll need to figure this one out a bit.  The white plastic pieces are meant to shoot water down into the in/out holes.  So they should be pointed down into the holes with the pointy end away from the filter.  The black o-rings should be in the filter itself, I had to use the white pieces to push them back completely.  It kinda sits on there a bit woobly, but once the cap screws down it secures it.
-

Now if you overtighten it you may get leaks, as well as under tighten it (horray plastic fittings!) Overtightening also can warp the plastic, and break o-rings so be careful.

Even after getting it together completely correctly there's STILL a bit of a leak, albeit very slow.  This may be from my own over tightening, but it's still damn annoying.

All that being said, the water tastes fantastic, and the filters for this model sell 4 for 20$ which is very cheap compared even to the popular culligan model (I'll buy a culligan for the bathroom sink to compare)

I really knock them for cutting corners.  This SHOULD be a great product, and hopefully they address some of these issues on their next design iteration.  Metal fittings, and clear instructions would lead to this taking over the Culligan line as the top of the market.",3.0
"I bought these because I use foam brushes for a very strong 2 part sealer for my art sculptures, and they always fall apart too quickly. The reviews I read here sounded like these may have been sturdier - however, they weren't any better than others I have used. Each brush also has a sticker on the foam part that leaves a sticky residue when removed.",3.0
"Tried a few times to install without leaking.  I have a standard ordinary faucet but still needed to hunt for better sized washers. For a few pennies, a greater selection of washers could have been included. It's the little things that become an annoyance and eat time. After 2 months , it still sits uninstalled.",3.0
"For a knife at this price point, the blades (although sharp) were poorly ground.  Although I fixed the with a stone, I shouldn't have had to.",3.0
"I waited to review this so I could use it a while.  After having done so for two weeks, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed.  I expected pristine tasting water; my water is not pristine, but it is better.  Luckily, this was not an expensive product",3.0
"the filtered water is significantly better than the tap water. Not terribly difficult to install with included tool, however the gasket from the adapter to the faucet head makes a poor connection as it is slightly too loose, and the other gaskets were too big to allow a connection. It would have been nice to have a metal adapter. with properly fit gaskets.",3.0
"It does what it does, that's all I care to say.",3.0
"These are quality bulbs that work and last. The price is unbeatable and a good alternative to expensive single item offers in Home Depot and the rest. One problem, the volume of the bulb itself is much greater than what I can easily fit in the compartment of the cabin light.",4.0

Bought these items because the one's I was buying at the local hardware store were more expensive and did not last that long.,4.0
"I don't know what the usual life span is for these lights, but mine lasted about a year. At this price, for the quantity I need in my kitchen, I don't mind repurchasing each year. This was my second purchase of these.",4.0

good product and value,4.0
Of course time will tell if they last longer than the other bulbs I have brought. Too early to tell,4.0
So far I am very happy with this purchase. I was reluctant at first because the glass was frosted. But they actually look just as good as the clear glass bulbs that I used to buy at Loews for $7 each. This has been a great deal so far and I will definitely purchase these in the future.,4.0
"These worked fine, shipped fast and were a good price.  The only thing was that the pins were too large in diameter to fit in the socket, so I had to grind them down just a little in order to push them into the socket.",4.0
excellent high quality product! Would definitely purchase this product again! Little longer than product replacing with! one 1/4 inch longer!,4.0
"I purchased since the price of 3 bulbs at the big box stores is $12.00 on average. The items are packaged very well, individual boxes wrapped in plastic in each box. I did notice however, they are night as bright as the Phillips version. That may just be the bulb I used but since I use the for under the counter touch on/off 3 way brightness, they work well for me. I am seeing how long they last at this point, but over all a very good value for the money!",4.0
"Don't do what I did and ASSUME the length would be OK.  The bulbs are nice and they worked as long as I didn't put the lenses back on my light housings.  These really are rather long -- MUCH longer than the ones I needed.  As long as a 37mm long bulb will fit in your housing, you should have no issues.",4.0
Have not used these long so I can not comment on the longevity of this product but the price beat the local store to heck and back. We have several lights that take these bulbs so I purchased 2 orders. If I had not found these at this price I might have opted to change out the halogen lights with LED ones. These bulbs saved me the trouble.,4.0
Haven't installed any yet - but they look to be exactly as we ordered them and should work out fine,4.0
The bulbs were easy to install.  The bulbs are performing well.  I am able to lower the brightness level on our under cabinet fixtures without losing visibility.,4.0
"i installed these on a low-voltage recessed lighting system in my kitchen, on a Lutron Maestro MAELV switch.  Dimming works well, there is no audible buzzing at all.  Color is warm and comparable to the halogen bulbs that I replaced with these LEDs.  Only issue is that 3 of the 10 bulbs had metal pins that were slightly too short, and wouldn't lock into place firmly in the fixture, so they couldn't be used.  The other 7 in the package were fine.",4.0
I am happy with these lighting systems. Used in a multiple format they provide adequate light at a much reduced energy output..,4.0
"Holy cow these are bright.  We had been using the 20w standard halogen in our kitchen and they would burn out in a couple month ... the did light the kitchen, but barely (10000 hours my foot). Anyways, saw these and thought that 5w usage with an 'Equivalent' rating of 50w would work and bring a little needed light to the kitchen (I have used LED and CF bulbs before that had an equivalent rating that was always overrated). These things, though, it's like I put in a 150w bulb. We were just going to replace a couple but had to replace more since the rest of the kitchen seemed dim and shady.  I cannot speak towards the longevity of these, but they are bright. Maybe too bright ... I am sitting here seeing things that need cleaned :)",4.0
"Great price, but of the first two bulbs in installed, one of them had the pins break off while pushing into the socket.",4.0
"Short bulb as was needed, seems to be a good purchase at a great price. Bulbs been in about 3 weeks with no issues.",4.0
"Installed these lights after being very careful not to touch the metal tips with my fingers after reading about it.  Two units went out very fast and I didn't use the lights often, so I had to replace them.  Luckily I had spares with this purchase.",4.0

"bought a 10-pack for office supplies, it's too early to tell if they're good for the 1500 hr life but so far they're good. a buck each- what a deal! locally they're around 3.50 each. big savings.",4.0
Purchased a pack of ten of these for the price it would have cost to purchase two bulbs at Home Depot or Lowes.  Work just as good as more expensive alternatives.  Which they had a greater selection of wattages though.,4.0
"I use these for my under cabinet lights. They are slightly whiter/bluer than the more expensive ones I buy at the store for way more money. But for the price, I can handle it. Like that I can buy in bulk and the savings is great!",4.0
These bulbs fit the fixture fine and work as expected.  Haven't had them long enough to comment on longevity. But so far so good.,4.0
A little longer than my other halogens so I had to take the covers off of the puck lights but the price makes it worth it.,4.0
"Good product, the only thing is that I didn't read the warmth of the light and it is too yellow compared to what I had before. It does not look as bright as the other I had, but the good thing is that all of them were out and I had to replace them so they don't look different temperatures; other than that good product and very good price. I got ten bulbs for the same price I would have gotten one at home depot and it has nothing to do with quality cause sometimes my home depot didn't even last 6 months, and these have been running for about 3 months now. I don't know you but I rather buy 10 that's going to last me at least 3 months than one that's going to last me 6 months.",4.0
"Fit in and worked as advertised.  We will see how long it lives, but I have 9 replacements in case the life is not that long..... :)",4.0
"They fit the described socket G8.  My use was outside motion light.  Appear to be about 35 watts in light output, slightly warm color.",4.0
Good value and they work fine. Remains to be seen how long they last. Low power consumption is the real motivation.,4.0
Excellent deal on quality product,4.0
Ordering these bulbs for my under-counter kitchen lights saved a boat-load of money compared to going to Home-Depot.  They work great.,4.0
Best Price I found and working well so far.  If it lasts past the normal life span of bulbs bought at the hardware store it will garner 5 stars.,4.0

serves its purpose,4.0
excellent good,4.0
Good value,4.0
These cost $6 at the home stores so a price of .86 is a huge improvement. Fits the fixture perfectly.,4.0
They work fine for replacements at a far cheaper price. I would suggest these because they are slightly shorter and able to fit in more reflectors. They matched up perfectly to the burned out ones I was replacing.,4.0
"Only used 2 out of the 10 pieces, but it works well.",4.0
These lamps were a fraction of the cost of similar products elsewhere. Quality? They work just like the original. Longevity? Can't be worse than the originals. We'll see.,4.0
"A great deal on light bulbs!  For the money, I certainly couldn't find better bulbs.  I love halogen bulbs as a light source when reading.  My four-star rating is more because I had to buy  a group of 10 than a smaller amount--like 4.",4.0
The bulbs meet expecations. Price was very good and product shipped quickly. A great value that seems to last longer than ones purchased at HD. Will order again.,4.0
"Like others here have said, they are big and do not fit in puck lights. I mean, they fit but the lens doesn't fit back on very well.",4.0
"working so far, a few weeks, no porblemnot high quality feel, but no problem and much more reasonable price than others",4.0
"Just be aware... These bulbs are larger than the usual G8 based bulbs. They barely ""fit"" in the light fixtures that I have.

UPDATE: It's been 4.5 months since I installed the first couple of bulbs and the first of those bulbs has burnt out. Used almost daily for 4-6 hours each day, that's fewer than 1000 hours on that bulb.

UPDATE II: It's been 9 months since purchase, the other three bulbs that were installed are still going strong. The one that burned out in 4.5 months must have just been a bad bulb.",4.0
"The bulbs are shorter than other Halogen 120V, 50W G8 bulbs I have bought in the past, which in my case made it a bit harder to install in the fixtures, although I would not consider that a problem. Installed in outdoor landscape light fixtures about a year ago and after considerable use in all kinds of weather none has failed.
Excellent service by the seller and by Amazon.",4.0
"The light bulbs arrived quickly. They are as pictured, and the bulb I tested worked perfectly. Unfortunately, the glass bulb part was slightly too large for my under-counter light fixtures. This was my fault -- but carefully check the size of your existing bulbs! Not all G8 bulbs are the same.",4.0
Quality????? Time will tell but I find the light quality to be a match to the bulb that came with the fixture.  The price is right so if they last as long as the original they are a very good deal.,4.0
Worked well and cannot tell the difference from the original bulbs.,4.0
Purchased to replace lights on an odd Hampton Bay ceiling fan.  Took a chance going by the visual and power specs.  They fit like a charm!,4.0
"I had a lamp that I brought from Germany when we moved back to the States that used these bulbs.  Since I hadn't lived Stateside for a while, I wasn't sure if I could get them anywhere.  Amazon had the best price so I ordered.  These bulbs look exactly like they do in the photo and came very quickly and well-packed.  I got 10 of them and none are broken.
They were perfect and a very quick replacement.  Bright and clear.  Can't speak about how long they last yet but if there's an issue then I'll re-post.  Generally a good buy for what they are.",4.0
"The only issue was probably me actually... I ordered 6 bulbs and thought I was getting a fairly good deal after looking at the prices in stores.  To my surprise, I received 6 packages of 12 bulbs.  That's a lifetime supply of low voltage bulbs.",4.0
good,4.0
"The ceramic base is very similar to the bulbs purchased with our fixture.  So far so good after a few months as expected.  Other replacement bulbs I purchased did not have this base, they were a glass extension of the bulb which occasionally broke while removing for replacement.",4.0
"WAYY less expensive here than local stores. The 3 I tried all worked fine, be sure as with all halogen bulbs to wear gloves or similar and not get any of the oils from your skin on the bulb, or they will likely eventually shatter. Been going strong for a couple of months now in our new bathroom fixture, will probably be a while before I need to buy more!",4.0
"Easy to install, although the ""cut length"" may not fit all applications.  Good ""mood light"" for TV room or others.",4.0
"I was looking for a replacement for a 6' under the counter light.  My mistake, if you want a plug in with no switch...it is just fine.",4.0
"I used this rope light to illuminate a small sign which originally had neon. Worked great. Bright light, doesn't generate heat, and consumes less energy.  For my application I wish an in-line switch was offered as the light is turned on and off daily.  Otherwise great product.",4.0
appears to be a quality product.....my experience with rope lighting quality comes with the length of time you use it and whether or not sections start to fail. These are the first LED rope lights I have purchased and from what I can see there is not an option to cut the length shorter so this might be something to consider with your application when deciding between standard and LED rope lighting.,4.0
"I used this near the bottom of the master bath vanity for a night-lite.  It puts out an orange glow on the floor and the color looks very good on the medium brown wood floor.  It has been installed since last year with no problems.  I suspect that it is a bit fragile because the first one that came only lit up half of the string.  It should have been shipped in a box -- not an envelope.  The seller promptly replaced it (with another one shipped in an envelope).  The rope light came with some mounting clips, but not enough of them to hold this securely.  Since I also had the clips from the first rope light, I was able to install this without much sagging.  I am just hoping that my wife does not slam the vacuum cleaner into it.",4.0
"So far so good  I bought a ton of these  because over the years  they burnt  out frequently  so I bought a lot to have in stock ,
It never dawned on me that it probably was the poor quality bulb to begin with.  So anyway  these are outlasting  the previous brand  by a lot
I would say i will buy again  but  I probably have enough in my stock  to last a lifetime",4.0

"I like these because they are cheap and they seem to work well. I don't know how long they last but when you have ten of them, it's probably going to be okay no matter what the result is. I have not tried plugging this in to a potato yet but I am hopeful that it would also work with the right wiring.",4.0

The bulbs arrived at my door faster than I expected. I opened the box and the bulbs were just sitting there in a plastic bag without any packing peanuts or bubble wrap which I thought was strangely odd since they're light bulbs and can be damaged pretty easily. I checked all the bulbs for shattered glass luckily there was none. So far all the bulbs seem to be working just fine. I'll send an update once they begin to burn out. I placed them in the kitchen and hallway which we use quite often so hopefully (crossing fingers) they last as long as promised.,4.0

Worked great.  Still bright after a couple months of daily use,4.0
"I got these to replace some range hood bulbs that went out. They are not quite as bright as the other 20W bulbs came with the hood. However, they also have a more warm color, which I tend to prefer. Overall, I like them, the price and quality so far seem good.",4.0
Use to pay $8 - $12 per bulb. . .  No more.,4.0
"Only used one so far, but it worked. much cheaper that the hardware stores. As long as one does not touch them with your fingers (where CLEAN gloves) they should last. They are just a common halogen bulb.",4.0
"I bought these with some hesitation because they seemed almost too good of a value, but I am very pleased the product. The bulbs seem to be of good quality and served the purpose that I had purchased them for. I will update if they don't last very long, but after a month installed...seems like they will be fine.",4.0

"Some dead bulbs in the pack (haven't tested all of them, but the lamp uses 3 and one of the first 3 I tried was dead, so 1 out of 4 was DOA), but they fit the Ikea track lighting i have perfectly. The pack was large and cheap enough that it's worth a few dead ones, though, I think.",4.0

"Couldnt believe how much these cost at retail stores, found it here for a fraction of that price! works perfect",4.0
"I ordered these bulbs since they were by far the cheapest around, even after the shipping cost. They came a few days after ordering, relatively fast compared to most independent sellers, many of whom wait until the last minute. My lighting track came with 3 sockets for GU10 bulbs, and I added another. I previously had 4 50w bulbs. I would estimate the lighting provided for my room from 3 50w is about the same as 4 of these 35w. The color is more of a yellow hazy light, a noticeable difference from the more powerful Philip 50w I had installed. As a result, I always feel as if its late at night when the lights are on in the room. I can't speak for the same brand's 50w bulbs, but I know a lot of people who would go nuts being in a room with such lighting. Keep that in mind when purchasing. I know nothing about the longevity of these lights, I'll update when one goes out. I give 4/5 stars since its what I expected, nothing too spectacular.",4.0
"These are much less expensive than local Home Depot or Lowes. Shipping was super fast & arrived in perfect condition. I only tried 1 bulb so far & it worked. Seems as bright as the same wattage bulbs that came with my light fixture. No obvious difference in color. These bulbs are not transparent on the sides so it only shines forward, where my current bulbs are, so they also illuminate the glass globe around it. Not a problem really- i can always replace them all at once since this is a 12 pak.",4.0
"I priced these out everywhere else and this was the cheapest. I had my doubts but they seem to be working out just fine. Delivery was way faster than expected, they are mailed using usps but I received them in about 5-6 days.",4.0
"I was a little skeptical when I ordered these that they would be as good as a brand name you could pick up at home depot for almost $7 a bulb, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the 35w bulbs for use in my track lighting and they are all working perfectly after a couple weeks.  No duds that I have run into, and I used half the box already.  I'll be buying these again in the future!",4.0
This type of Halogen bulb costs twice as much at hardware stores. This supplier gave prompt service and answered a question that I had about the bulbs' current draw very promptly. I am pleased with the bulbs and the service. The only objection I had was that there was a rather large shipping charge for my shipment which arrived in the US Post Office standard $5 deliver-anywhere box.,4.0

"Are these cheap bulbs that may not last as long as a name brand? Absolutely. I have 10 of these bulbs in my vanity fixtures in our master bathroom. I've just now gone through all 10 after 4 years (meaning I'm ordering more, not that they have all burnt out yet.) You do the math. If your bulbs are intermittent like mine, these are totally the way to go. If they are landscape lighting that are on for 6 hours a day and you have the room for larger LED bulbs in your fixtures, it's time to upgrade to LEDs!",4.0

"I picked up these lights to mount under my daughter's bed. I ran them along the bottom of her bed frame and used simple plastic zip-ties to hold everything in place. Now all she has to do is flip the switch on the plug-in power bar, and she's got a perfect nightlight.
The color is perfect for her room and it kicks out better light than her old nightlight. She loves it.
Now my son wants the same thing in green.",4.0
appears to be a quality product.....my experience with rope lighting quality comes with the length of time you use it and whether or not sections start to fail. These are the first LED rope lights I have purchased and from what I can see there is not an option to cut the length shorter so this might be something to consider with your application when deciding between standard and LED rope lighting. These also have fuses in the plug head....not sure if this will give it a longer life or not...guess you will have to stock some fuses just in case the go out.,4.0
they work as billed nothing fancy but basic value for money.. nothing exicting here. if you need a some lights you can buy them,4.0
Great price!! Just wish I could have purchased fewer for a bit of a discount... But now I have enough lights for my desk lamp for the next 100 years!,4.0
I have a lampstand where it requires to have this kind of light bulb. It may not be as bright as I have expected but it can be accepted for it brings light to my work desk.,4.0
"It works well, but I did not need a package of 10, which will probably last me 20 years.",4.0
"First, the price: it's just great.
Packing and shipping was good too.

Now the bulbs are not as long as many other G9 50W bulbs - but I knew that buying them as some other have commented about it.

Once in my fixture, the light is a little more yellow in tint and seem not as bright as the other bulbs I have in a bathroom fixture. This could be due to the shorter size, or the shorter size + the bulb being made differently from one brand to another.

That doesn't bother me, but if you are sensitive to it, having a different light effect with the shorter bulbs might be something to consider. The solution: change all bulbs at once, as for the price of 1.5 bulb you get 10.
Therefore overall it's still a very good value. Not quite 5 stars, but very good nonetheless.",4.0

These bulbs are $8 each in the major stores so 3 for $10 is excellent. One of the 3 had a large bead of solder on the side of the base screw that prevented it from screwing far enough into the holder to connect and work. The other 2 have worked perfectly for the past couple of months so still a great deal. If I take a file and grind off the solder bead from the third bulb I'm sure I will be able to fix it as well but I don't need it at the moment.,4.0

"I recently purchased a set of these bulbs for the bar shelf lights at one of the bars I help manage. They arrived quickly and we were able to light up the liquor with ease. In addition, I loved that they worked well with our dimmer pad so we can adjust the lighting level as needed. Furthermore, when our corporate manager saw the bulbs in action she immediately had me order to more sets for the other two company stores. The last time we bought bulbs like this, they lasted for about 3 weeks before they began fizzling out. Well, we have been using these bulbs on a regular basis for over a month now and they are all still good as new. I also love that all 10 bulbs arrived in full working order. (We have had issues in the past when ordering bulk items like this)  In fact all 3 sets, came exactly the same way. So I know it wasn't just a random chance of luck that they all worked. High five for consistency!
The only reason I give them four stars instead of five is because the bulbs are extremely hard to install. From their minuscule size to the tiny prongs you have to plug in, its really hard to ensure that the bulb is fully in place. So when you're working with light fixtures atop high shelves (like I was) it can be quite nerve wrecking when you can afford to drop a single bulb. Other than that, everything about this product was perfect from start to finish.",4.0
bulbs work great in fiber optic tree and pumpkin.,4.0
"Product was delivered quickly and was as described.  I  was replacing the 75W and wanted less light intensity, so I ordered the 50W.  To my surprise, they were still too bright.  The next time, I would go even lower, especially for areas that you would be of close proximity!",4.0
"They are cheap but don't seem to last very long. But if the location of the bulb is easily accessible, then go for it",4.0

"The price was very good it was shipped quickly and it saved one of our lighted Christmas village displays from waste disposal for years to come,  It required a light source for the fiber optics display.

Good value,4.0
"I am somewhat suspect of these because of the cheap price. They replaced all my blown ones, which was all of them, and one day later, they still all lit. That counts for something. I was fanatical about the use of gloves and letting absolutely no 'hand oils' from getting on the bulbs. Let's see how many more days they will last. We have bets on which will go first and I think some people are cheating by touching them with their bare fingers. Bastards, the burns on their fingers will give them up. OK, we'll see.",4.0
"These light bulbs work pretty well, and definitely work better than the ones that came with my light fixture.  But it's important to note, if you want these bulbs to last more than a couple months, DO NOT HANDLE THEM WITHOUT GLOVES or at least don't touch them bare handed.  The oil on your hands will heat up the bulb and make them die early.  Treat them like theater lamps, and they'll work fine.",4.0
"When the bulb in my bathroom fixture burned out, I first went to the box store where I bought the fixture.  When I saw that they were selling the replacement bulb for $6.48 each, I realized I had to do something different.
These bulbs are an excellent value and the light output seems well matched to the remaining OEM bulbs in the bathroom.",4.0
Great price for all these lights for my fiber optic tree. Shipping took longer than expected,4.0
"Great value.  Had to buy a pack of 12 bulbs, only needed 1.  Should be a lifetime supply.  First one in pack was broke but still have 11 to use.  Exact fit for a Santa we've had for over 20 years.  Couldn't find these in a retail store.",4.0

"Replacement bulb for an old Ikea 20W desk lamp.  Very good price.  First bulb failed almost immediately, developing a white-yellow coating all over the inside of the bulb.

Note: G4 indicates 4mm separation between the two posts.",4.0

"Works as advertised.  Cheaper than box store.  Not sure how long they will last, but was willing to take a chance since I had 7 that were out.  Mine seem to fail due to corrosion at the pins rather than burnout.  I did grease the pins, hopefully that will help.",4.0

"I was pleasantly surprised that this bulb fit my 5 foot Fiber Optic Christmas Tree.  The original bulb that came with the tree said 12 Volt, 16 Watt.  The top of the reflector cup measured 1 1/2 inch across, but these MR11, 12 Volt, 20 Watt, bulb measured 1 inch across, but the prongs fit perfectly into the unit.  And, the tree is working wonderfully and has strong color just like the original.  The only thing that I worry about is that it cannot be secured into the unit due to the smaller size.  But, it works.  If you ship it somewhere, or pack it away for the year, I will have to be fairly careful so that the bulb does not separate from the unit.  If it does, I will have to take the base apart and just plug the bulb back in to the unit due to the lack of being able to secure it into the unit.  If you cannot find the original bulb, these will work.  But, I am going to try to find the correct size bulb so I can get it secured tightly into the unit.",4.0
"I really like the splash-proof durability of these bulbs, as I use them for my family room aquarium. My only gripe with them is the fact that the prongs break off very easily. They need adjusting out-of-the-box. So, in doing so, I have to be extremely careful, as to not snap them clean off. Once I've installed them, they work just fine. I only wasted one bulb from my 12-pack. At this price, I
d have to say go with it. Just be mindful of the prongs fragility. Good buy.",4.0

"I purchased a 12 pack of MR 11 20W Halogen landscape lights. The Amazon price was around 20% of the cost I would have paid at a home improvement store. I received the bulbs in a short time.

I also liked that the bulbs were sealed within the lamp by a clear cover, something the light bulbs that I replaced did not have. I am hoping that the life of these light bulbs lives up to the rating on the box.",4.0
"These bulbs are excellent buy! They are certainly very bright but I am not sure about their longevity. In any case, beats the more expensive ones.",4.0
"So far, the bulbs work per my expectation. You can't beat the price.  I used to buy Intermatic bulbs for ~$8 each from HomeDepot and got tired of replacing them when they go out. My close examination of failed bulb revealed that Intermatic is using a shoddy material for the pins - every single bulb's pin corrode and break off within a few months even with a light usage. In each case, bulb filament is perfectly fine but the pin breakage at the neck makes the bulb useless. I can't help think Intermatic may be doing this intentionally. Anyway, I'll carefully keep track of how long CBconcept bulbs would last, but even if they only last as long as Intermatic brand, with the price of less than $1 each, shame on you Intermatic!",4.0

Haven't used any yet so I can't speak to the quality of the bulbs right now but the package deal will ensure I don't get stuck without replacements when necessary.  Much cheaper buying in quantity...beats going to Lowes or Home Depot and paying close to this much for one bulb.  If they last it will be a great buy.,4.0
"The light bulbs themselves are great.  The price is very good and they were shipped quickly and well.  The only problem for my is that the bulbs work in my kitchen lighting fixture, except they are slightly too wide for the frosted bulb cover to fit over.  This has been very frustrating.  They are expensive track light, but all of the bulbs that I have ordered so far do not fit into the bulb cover.  I am now having to use the bulb with the cover.  Next time I will look for frosted bulbs!",4.0
"The items work pretty well - the price was exceptionally low (so 5 stars would be my norm for this experience). However, the bulbs did *not* come in a box as shown in the picture of the item here. They were dumped in two small plastic bags (each had 10) for shipment in a tiny padded envelope - one star reduction as a result since they could easily have been crushed.

The pins on all the bulbs are a bit bent (i.e., not exactly parallel), indicating inexpensive manufacturing but this is relatively easy to fix. Just bend them back into position - makes it a bit tougher to insert into the holder for the lamp I had, but can be done if some care is taken.

I have only used four of the bulbs so far, and they work without any problems - the light level is consistent (to my eye) on all of them. I will thus assume that the rest will work too - I ordered two sets of 10 since these style bulbs do not last very long apparently, and I will be replacing them frequently in this particular lamp (it takes 5 bulbs normally - argh).",4.0
A LOT OF BULBS FOR THE MONEY . BETTER THAN BUYING LOCAL AND SPENDING MORE FOR A SINGLE BULB . SEEMS TO BE VERY GOOD QUALITY .,4.0
Here is the bottom line. I was sick of paying a ton of money for bulbs that burnt out frequently. For the cost of these it doesn't matter if some are duds because you are still saving money. So far they last as long as the name brand versions at a way less expensive price.,4.0
"For the money, this 10-pack is a great value compared to the name-brand alternatives.
Perhaps the big guys lamps last longer, but so far the CBConcept replacements have
been just fine. They fit the G9 socket properly, and light with the same brightness as the
neighboring lamps. Even if a couple are duds, I still come out ahead with this set of bulbs.",4.0
So far I like it. The manufacturer only advertises a 1500 hour life - less than for GE bulbs. It is as bright as a GE bulb.,4.0
"I've only installed one so far, but it worked properly upon installation and the light it gives off is as good as the bulb it replaced. I like having extras on hand as halogen bulbs are soooo expensive to buy locally.",4.0
"These lamps were what I needed.  Easy to replace.
Just remember to wear gloves or use tissue. (Keep oil skin from  Lamp)",4.0
These are the best priced bulbs and they actually work! I've tried others but they burn out quickly. These work great!,4.0
"product works fine so far, time will tell how long they last. here are 8 more words to finish reveiw.",4.0
"Overall a good product. I found that the wire loops at the bottom of the bulb are not quite as long as those found on retail bulbs I can purchase in Canada. I replaced three existing bulbs, in one of the fixtures the new bulb seems very loose but the bulb still works. Shipping was quick and I got 10 bulbs for the price of one bulb sold at retail in my local area. I will purchase again",4.0
"Having a lot of landscape lighting means needing spare bulbs all the time and big box stores charge way too much.  This is the way to buy them, bulk packed for 1/4 the Lowes/Home Depot price.",4.0
These lights are not as bright as the ones I had previously bought at Lowes but for the price they work perfectly! I highly suggest these as a good alternative cost.,4.0
"I had a couple of lamps burn out over the winter months.  Needed to get some spares and found this 10 pack for the Hampton bay lamps.  Fit fine, worked fine, rapid delivery.",4.0
These are replacement bulbs for my under-the-counter lighting. They blow out regularly and I got tired of paying $5 at Home Depot for a bulb. Recommended.,4.0
Product arrived on time and worked great in my outdoor lights. The packaging was unusual but did not effect the bulbs functionality.,4.0
"These are much less expensive than what you get in a store.
They also required more frequent replacement than what I had purchased in stores before, even when handling carefully to make sure oils from my hands did not get on them.
All bulbs worked, no duds.

More frequent replacement didn't bother me too much, as my fixtures are pretty easy to work with to replace bulbs.
My fixtures are outdoors full time, so maybe indoor fixtures would help them last longer.
Overall I still think these saved me a good chunk of change even with more frequent replacements.",4.0
"These were the most economical choice at the time.  I used three bulbs, one for each of my display cases. Within two days one of the new bulbs died. Replaced that one with another from the pack. Hopefully the one that died was a dud.",4.0
"Taking into account the price plus shipping, the net price of this item is a good value when compared to other halogen light options.  Lights have lasted a good period of time without problems.",4.0
"I will give them 4 stars because they seem to be in perfect condition but I didn't buy the right bulbs. I have IKEA's under the cabinet light and the bulbs that is burned don't have info on them. So I check on IKEA website and they said that the bulb needed is 12v G4 10W or 20W. Since they were 5$ for 10, I decided to try them.

But they are not what I tought they would be. The original one that is burned is 2 times bigger then those bulbs so I think I will need to go to Home Depot and ask somebody what are those bulbs.

I'm now stuck with 10 bulbs and I don't know where to used them. The environmentalist in me is angry at myself.",4.0
The product works as described.  The price was good.  I will buy again if in the need of a replacement,4.0
"I have about 20 lights, with varying voltages between 12 and 14V, and I think I've gone through about 12 of these in a year. I don't think its the voltage, however, because I have about the same failure rate on each circuit. The only good thing is these are dirt cheap. The original bulbs that came with the lights went out just as often, so I can't say that these are any better/worse than those. Not sure if they were high quality to start with. Again, just buy a bunch to have on hand.  Gotta go change 2 now.",4.0
"This 10 piece set of 12v G4 10W bulbs was a much needed relief to my otherwise dark living room. The bulbs were efficiently packaged and delivered, all within a timely manner. The color temperature from these bulbs was slightly warmer than that of the original Ikea bulbs, but the difference in negligible, and doesn't stand out if all of the bulbs are replaced.",4.0
"bulbs last as long as the malibu bulbs I paid $2.50 a piece for at home depot. I would buy the bulbs again, thay are good value.",4.0
Good product; good price.,4.0
The fish and coral are very nice. They were smaller than I had expected but that is my fault for not reading better.  It sticks really nice to the wall and the coral is very real looking.,4.0
"Because the description said ""repositionable"" I was thinking these would be static clings rather than stickers, but they work just fine. My office at work has a wall that's glass from about hip height upward and we call it the fishbowl - these are perfect. They're translucent enough that you can see the design from both sides (there's a slight hint of white on the backside, but you can definitely see the design clearly) and I get just an extra hint of privacy since people tend to look at the fish before they look at me.
I did need to reposition a few pieces and the edge rolled about 1mm or so under, but there's a large enough margin around the outside that it doesn't block the ink at all.
I'd order these again.",4.0
"It is good in general.  I like the water lines, corals and the stones.  I will give 5 stars if the fish are bigger.",4.0
"I didn't read the specs well, these are really stickers not window clings.. but it looks nice .. it was fun applying it and gives a nice aquarium look!",4.0
They are easy to use. Covered a nice size space. Not too sue about the coral floating in middle nowhere,4.0
"The lights perform just as they are supposed to.  I ordered, and received the pure white tint.  In hind site the softer hue would have been a better choice  Overall the product is excellent, it was my doing that the hue is not what totally matches the rest of the lighting in the yard.  Had I ordered the softer hue I would be giving them a 5-star review.",4.0
"They look great and the price is great but there seems to be a very faint flicker on some of them. I installed 6 of them in an elevator and two of them flicker. You really need to look closely for a while to notice it but its there. At first I thought it was the transformed but its only two of the six, and they are all on the same 12VAC transformer. I will try with a 12VDC unit and see if that does anything. I will update you on how long they last.",4.0
They do not flicker when dimmed! With that very positive note the only minor downside is that they are quite a bit brighter then the 20 halogen's they replaced. Overall very happy with these bulbs.,4.0
so far so good for my outdoor landscape lighting,4.0
Working well in outside lighting. No issues and have been installed for 2 months,4.0
"So far am very happy with these bulbs. They've been in my landscape lighting for a couple of months now, and look good. Will purchase again when more of the old halogen bulbs go out and need to be replaced.",4.0
"These are great replacements to my range. The halogen lights you could feel the heat coming off them. These are cool to the touch, meaning less electricity being used. Also good for preventing burns as our range has semi hidden buttons and the lights are nearby those buttons. They are of the same brightness as the halogen it replaced.

I knocked off one star because after a couple months of use, one of the clear plastic lenses that covers the LED fell off. The light still worked so I super glued the clear lens to the rest of it. It may have been due to steam from cooking but honestly, we don't do that kind of cooking that often. It's now been months since I glued it and it has stayed attached and the other lens never fell off.",4.0
Bright bulbs for my landscaping so far works great. Replaced all mine with LEDS too,4.0
"Shipment arrived on time, but I took a week to replace the 20w with these. I actually like these better than the 20w that was in the Malibu outdoor lighting fixture. The lights look pretty good and disperse enough light, in fact better than the 20w.

It's a no brainer, buy these and replace your 20w outdoor halogen with these 1.8 watt, you won't be sorry.",4.0
"For the price, you can't beat it. The product has a nice light similar to the xenon one it replaced. I wish the cone was a little shorter; it barely fit in my landscape light (screw-in compartment). The plastic cover for the LEDs fell out a few times while replacing- not a big deal just re-set it, but took a few extra minutes.",4.0
"These replacement led bulbs looks and works well. MTB is yet to be determined, other LED bulbs lasted about 1yr.",4.0
"The bulbs arrived quickly and well packaged.  All bulbs were the same G8 size; there was even a quality control slip in the box indicating that they were checked.  The light is well matched to my other bulbs in color tone (a bit on the warm side, not a cooler light like a xenon bulb).  The only issue is that I received frosted bulbs; the picture indicates clear bulbs. This was not a problem in my application (I imagine that they ship both).  For the price this was a great purchase.  Yes, the bulbs are made in China, but so are most of the other options, like the Feit bulbs.",4.0
These are typically replacement bulbs for undercabinent lights.  They work just fine & are very reasonably priced.,4.0
Product was packaged well.  Delivered promptly.  I would recommend this vendor and use them again.,4.0
Excellent,4.0
very white light,4.0
Very convenient and well priced,4.0
Good product and value,4.0
"Great value - works fine, great price, prompt delivery.",4.0
These little hotties are just what I needed.  The price was reasonable compared to some individually packaged ones.  Just be sure they are the ones to fit your fixtures.,4.0
No problems.,4.0
Great price...hope they last! Just installed...Many brands burn out fast....will have to wait and see. But can not beat the price.,4.0
The bulbs work perfectly so far. I knew I would have to change the fixture if I had to continue to pay $7 plus per bulb at the local big box stores. Just be sure you know the distance between the metal contacts of the bulbs you need since that is part of the process of getting the right one.,4.0
As soon as I got them I replaced about 8 that were burned out. That was over 3 months ago and they are still working (which they should) so I am happy!,4.0
I received the bulbs and installed them with out issue. It has been about six months and none of them have burnt out.,4.0
"I will be ordering these soon so that I'm well stocked with bulbs for my little desk lamp. FYI: In case some of you aren't aware, you should not touch the glass part of the bulb because the oil from your fingers will cause the bulb to get hotter than normal which decreases the life of the bulb. The best thing I have found to do is use a tissue (like Kleenex) to install. After I learned this from a lighting expert a few years ago my little halogen bulbs have lasted much longer!",4.0
"I order just 1 box, to check these bulbs out. I was afraid of a very short life because the affordable price.
I have a restaurant and we have about 50 fixtures with this particular light bulb. We were spending a fortune with Lowe's, about $7.50 per bulb.
This bulb appear to be of the same quality and so far they have not burned out yet, about 600 hrs.",4.0
Product is as advertised.  Wish I didn't have to buy a package of 12.  Will last me a lifetime as we have one fixture that uses the bulb.  It solved my problem as it would for anyone buying it.,4.0
Work as described,4.0
Its a light bulb. Not sure what to say about them. I got a pack with several in it and I'm still using the first one that came so they are lasting a while.,4.0
Fit the socket/connector perfectly. A substantial saving vs. OEM bulb price,4.0
Have ordered these twice.  Loved them.  Way less expensive than buying at HD or Lowes.  In last batch though I had two dud bulbs.  That's why the 4/5 stars.,4.0
All the bulbs worked so far (I put in 4 of the 10). They have a little dimple that makes it easy to pull the bulbs out. Can't speak for bulb life yet.,4.0
"I put this in our baby's room several months ago and now I have to rub them back on to the wall all the time. I am pretty sure as soon as she can reach it, it will be gone. I do love the way it looks, people always ask me if I painted it myself. It did take two of us to apply it. Cutting it out first and laying it out seemed to help.",4.0
"When I received the 2 sheets of decals I was a little disappointed, thought that it would not be enough and it looked very cheap, but once it's on the wall, it is beautiful, it really made my guest room more vibrant.",4.0
"Nice set. These bulbs go out a lot and quite expensive individually at my local stores, so a pack made a lot of sense",4.0
I'm so glad I bought this item they are very pretty and they have a little shine but I could tell they were cheap the sticker is very thin but I had no problem putting them on my set had no instructions but the flowers were label. If your careful and follow the numbers you will be fine,4.0
As advertised.,4.0
"What's to say about an item like this? They work. Who knows how long they will last, but for now I am satisfied.",4.0
"I was a little bit disappointed when I opened the package that it looks a little bit different in person. There is a small amount of glitter in the branches which kind of makes it look cheesy, and the colors were a lot brighter than in the picture. However, it was easy to put up and once it was up it added a lot to my daughter's bare walls. This is a great buy for a little girl's room...especially if you are renting and don't want to put holes in the walls or paint. I might purchase another one for another wall in the room, but I don't recommend it for anything you are trying to make look very sophisticated, as it looks like it belongs in a child's room.",4.0
"Very fast shipping, was what I expected, looks great in our cherry blossom themed bathroom. Some of the branches do not fit together flushed as would be expected, but it still looks good. Easy directions.",4.0
It works but not sure the quality and how long it will last.,4.0
"so far so good.  worked out of the box, none broken, and still going after a month.  Too early to really say if they'll last well.",4.0
"I didn't have any problem installing each light bulb although the light bulbs are fragile, so you have to be careful.  The space I have in the light cavity is small so the manuever to install is a tight one.  So far so good!",4.0
"This was a repeat order after a successful first experience. Product arrived on time, and was as described. Satisfied customer.",4.0
"These decals were really great. It took some time to put them up on the wall, but once finished, the wall really looked great.",4.0
Bought to stick on grand daughters desk. they are on but I am worried if they will stay on. So far so good.,4.0
"While I really like these ""stickers"" because they blend well with the other decals I purchased from Amazon, they are not as re-useable as the RoomMates brand wall decals.  These are more like REALLY strong stickers.  I had to adjust them after putting them up on my wall in my daughter's playroom and they pulled off the paint!

I'm glad I purchased these, but in the future I would stick with decals from RoomMates as they were easier to re-adjust and move from wall to wall.",4.0
"I really like the product.  It sticks great to the wall and can even be repositioned.  The only con is that (at least with my pack) the stickers weren't completely cut out, so I tore some when removing from the backing.  To avoid this problem, peel the surrounding or border off first so as to see where the stickers are still attached.  Then, with an x-acto knife cut the stickers where they are still connected.  Great product for the price!",4.0
"When I first opened this I had to set it face down on a hard surface with weights on each corner to get it to flatten out. I did this for about 3 days and it flattened out great. I looked at it and thought, no way are all the pieces here, but they definitely are, it just looks small on the sheet. The little spindly bits were a bit hard to work with and extremely sticky, which is good. I didn't follow the example it comes with, but made my own design, which was a little bit tricky, but I needed it to cover more wall space in my daughter's room. It turned out great and I am very happy with the product. I even stuck a few pieces to the wall and then decided to move them which was not a problem. They are fun, bright, and a very easy way to decorate a kids room without putting holes in the walls.",4.0
"Just be aware that these are not heavy duty... But for a light duty application they work great. I made a small table for the Cat's pillow and it looks excellent in our living room. It supports a human's weight for just sitting, but I think kids rough-housing on it my not be such a good idea.",4.0
"Perfect price for value of all items

These tools are helpful for prying open cell phones and other small electronics.  I got the set to repair my HTC Evo 4g and it worked great!! I was able to open my cell phone with no damage to the outer casing :-),4.0
"This screwdriver is a decent quality product and it did the job for me -- opening the case of a broken coffeemaker. The product description provides no dimensions other than the cryptic (""x50""). This could be a problem for you. The shaft of the screwdriver is 2"" long and its diameter is 0.1"".",4.0
Received 2 in the package.  Worked fine for what I needed.  Fair quality but good for the price.,4.0
"Good product that does the job just fine, only complaint is that the driver arrived with the letters on the handle smeared. It appeared as though the driver was subject to use before it arrived. Besides this, great shipping time, reasonably priced, does the job.",4.0
"It's not a Craftsman tool, but if you seat it carefully and keep good pressure, it does not strip out as other reviews implied.",4.0
"Wouldn't normally offer a review of an item like this except that I saw the only other review giving it such a low rating.  I have a Bates Motel sign just like this that was purchased at Spencers 7 years ago.  Is it made of cheap-looking plastic?  Yes.  Is anyone able to see this when it's lit up in your window at night? No.  We've received numerous complements on the sign by trick-or-treaters (and their parents) over the years.  And despite being made of plastic, the only reason I stumbled across this review is that two of the bulbs finally burned out- the only problem we've ever had with the sign in 7 years.",4.0
Platics and kinda cheesy but worked fine and people liked it from the street.,4.0
"Looks good, happy with the sign.",4.0
This was a gift for my brother and it looks really cool. The quality is pretty low but it is just a decoration. A real neon sign would be way more expensive and this has the desired effect. It may have cost a little much for what I got but my brother thought it was pretty cool.,4.0
"I bought two of these and really like them. Yes, it was over priced and they are cheaply made. Halloween is like Christmas in my home and I love all the classic horror films. If your worried about spending the money I would suggest you pass on this. Other wise I would suggest it. The customer picture is perfect. What you see is what you get!",4.0
Thin light plastic but I guess I wasn't expecting a replica from the set or anything -- it'll be fun for halloween.,4.0

Turn your house into the Bates Motel.  This plastic Bates Motel sign is perfect for your Bates Motel/Bates House setup at your house on Halloween night.  Hang it up, turn it on and let everyone know you're not hiding from the world...at least not on Halloween night.

This sign is made of kind of cheap plastic, but it gets the job done for occasional use when it really matters.

"Looked more substantial in the pictures, so when i ordered it was sad to see it was so flimsy, but thats okay because it won't be so hard to hang up.  Looks great from a distance.",4.0
I did a Bates Motel deal at home for this Halloween and this sign was a nice addition.  It has clear C-7 Christmas style lights behind a plastic front.  The two lights behind the 'vacancy' were on a flickering circuit with added to the effect.,4.0
"It was bigger than I thought it would be! Yes, it's a novelty, but I love it!! I have wanted this for a few hallowee's now and finally got it! Not disappointed!! Fun!!",4.0
"I read the other reviews but there's the deal. It's $25, I didn't expect it to be the highest quality. I put it up on my porch, you can't tell it's plastic, it looks awesome. It is a bit flimsy but it's been really windy and it's held up. Psycho fans can't pass this up. Happy Halloween!",4.0
"I absolutely LOVE Psycho and Norman Bates! I just got this sign as an early Christmas present from my dad and I love it! When you light it up it actually almost looks like a real neon sign. The ""A"" in ""Vacancy"" even flickers like it did in the movie, and the ""no"" isn't clear so it won't ever light up. :) When you look at it close up you can see the light bulbs inside it. It does come with instructions to replace the bulbs and a list of warnings, most of which talk about not leaving it in situations where the plastic could melt.

As much as I totally love this sign, it is made out of really, super cheap, flimsy plastic. It is most certainly meant as a seasonal Halloween decoration, not a permanent fixture even though that's what I'm going to use it as. I just won't turn it on all the time and I'll make sure I hang it somewhere safe.

I would highly recommend this for any and all Psycho fans! Keep safe and treasure it forever! :D",4.0
I read the reviews before I ordered. I couldn't understand how it could be so cheap. Well I do now. No one actually says why iy is cheap. It is the material it is made of is like a cheap flimsy and it bends easily. BUT If you hang it up plug it and leave it alone it is five stars all the way. It looks good hanging there and is certainly worth the money it is being sold for now. No its not a high dollar neon sign but it is official licensed and looks just like the bates motel sign. Also note the bulb behind the vacancy part of the sign is a twinkle kind of bulb so the vancancy word looks to be shorted out again just as the real psycho bates motel sign looks in the movies. I think I got my moneys worth.,4.0

"I purchased the 690 router separately a few months ago and now I decided I needed a plunge router capability so I purchased the plunge router base for the 690.  The plunge base is very well made and works great.  Adjustments are very well thought out, convenient, handy and easy to make.  My only recommendation is to buy the plunge base and router together as a kit since then you get the case for it and it's much cheaper.  PC charges a premium if you buy things separately.  I can't find a case that is sold separately for the combo kit either so if you buy them at different times like I did you are stuck with pieces of a kit rambling around in your shop.  The router and parts are very well made but if at all possible save up and buy the router and plunger kit, you won't regret it.",4.0
Works as advertised.,4.0

"The Porter Cable 1700 series comes with a 3/8"" collet.  Go figure.  That's OK if your a production shop, but they should sell the darn thing with a 1/4"" collet because it costs a fortune and their customers probably have a lot of 1/4"" shank bits.",4.0
"The collet works great and does what its suppose to do, but I think if PC is going to charge me 300 dollars for a VS 3 1/4 HP router it should come with a 1/4"" collet.",4.0

"so far a good base . locking lever is cheap, I don't know why the rest is built very well. and this will fit a porter cable 6912 router. I took a chance on buying it as there is not much info about the base and router combo.",4.0

"This is a nice base, it moves smoothly and is very easy to adjust the depth. The one thing I was less enthusiastic about was how it connected to the router motor, basically just has a screw with a rubber clamps. i would have liked it to connect in a more positive way seems like the concept was an after thought.",4.0
I couldn't buy this when I got my router initially - they hadn't been invented yet.  Was happy to upgrade.,4.0
"Not much to say, well made for the most part, all metal where it should be. My PC690 fits well. The depth adjustment rod is a little sticky. I think it has some burrs on it. I will pull it off and clean it up for easier use. I should have bought this in a kit with fixed base and router together.",4.0
"I am most pleased with this plunge base. The only reason that it does not get 5 stars is because you have to use a hex key to mount and remove the router from the base. If there were a quick release mechanism, then it would be perfect. Overall, this is a great product.",4.0
"The base is well-made, with thicker construction than the standard base.

The only two small cons I could find with this base is that if you let it travel to the top quickly, it can stick in the upright position, and require a gentle tap with a hammer on the left tower to release; the second is that it's a tad harder for a leftie to use-- I'm used to that by now, though.

In the 'would have been nice to have' category, I wish it had a dust collection port adapter. If you're routing signs or doing inlays, you spend a lot of time removing chips to check progress.",4.0
"I took me a few minutes to figure out how the compression bolt was supposed to hold the router.  Once I figured that out, the plunging worked great.  Perfect addition to my router.",4.0

Nothing much really to say.  It's a saw blade and does what it's supposed to do.  What I really like though is the Porter Cable worm drive saw.  I've had mine for a little over 20 years now and given the choice I'll reach for that saw every time.  Some jobs it's too small to handle like cutting dimensional lumber and I have to use my large skilsaw.  I have small battery powered saws also but given the choice I always choose this saw providing I have a place to plug it in.  On the downside blades aren't available in most stores so you need to order them online.  Order 1 or 2 extra because there's nothing worse than grabbing your saw and remembering you'd pretty well worn out the blade last time you used it.  Most recently my blade lasted long enough to cut six ends off laminate countertops and cut 3/4 inch plywood to make six endcaps.  That was pretty much it for the blade.  It made excellent smooth cuts though.  It just doesn't hold up for long when cutting particle board (especially) and plywood.,4.0
"I had an older blade that did a decent job of cutting my poplar, birch and oak plywoods.  When I noticed the blade started to burn from multiple uses, I naturally wanted a replacement.  When I got the replacement new blade it strangely did not work as well as the older blade.  It made fine cuts, but I noticed some unevenness and light shredding.

"I have stripped two big farmhouses to the bare wood, removed lots of interior old lead paint off of wood trim and plaster with these machines. All you need are plenty of disks, a spare backing pad, and muscle. When the disk gets clogged up you can try and pry off the paint cornflakes with a icepick or screwdriver. If they don't come off use a metal bucket of paint stripper for about 30 min and a quick wire brush. Buy the coarsest grit disk you can get. It is not so aggressive after a couple minutes of usage. Be sure to put plastic sheeting down and have respirators on. Watch out for the EPA!

"A brief background: We own a 100+ year old house in desperate need of repainting. Scraping was particulary ineffective since the previous owners painted over much of the loose and alligatored paint without throughly scaping or sanding it. Heat was not an option for paint removal since the fire risk was high because of the blown in cellulose under the clapboard. Finally, we are not fans of chemical removal.

The pros of this device: Does exactly what is says. It stripped the paint completely off of our clapboard siding, trim, and window frames with little effort (other than holding the heavy machine). With a bit of additional sanding the house was ready to prime and paint again. Discs do clog quickly on latex paint, but hardly clog at all on old, brittle oil based paint. 24 grit discs clogged less frequently than the 36 grit ones and worked well on the house. Discs can be used on a standard 6"" grinder as well as this machine. Much faster than any kind of sander we tried and better removal of paint. Less expensive than comperable products. Made by a great company and resale is generally at least 50-75% of the original purchase price.

The cons of this device: Very heavy and takes a while to build up your muscles (if not already well developed). Took a few clapboards to get the hang of it -- Had to sand out the disc marks on those. Does create quite a bit of dust (not able to attach to shop vac like some other devices), but with use of respirators, googles, dropcloths, and a HEPA filter shopvac for clean-up these concerns were minimized. Awkward to use on a ladder, much better if you have scaffolding. Not able to remove paint from the ends of clapboard, bottom claps over the sill plate, and the underside of the claps. Follow up with a hand sander was required. Backup pad (necessary rubber disc behind the metal grinding disc) wears out quickly and is expensive to replace. Discs gum up quickly on latex paint and I found it to be quite a bit of work (even with chemicals) to remove the built-up paint.

Despite the numerous cons, we have found this to be the only product that could produce the results we needed to have a quailty paint job on our house given its poor painting history.",4.0

"This is a great feature but it might have started a fire.  I was using a carbide blade to cut through existing subflooring and the sparks were really flying as I cut through both fiberboard and nails along the top of a floor joist.

Looked down to see smoke coming from the dust bag and a couple of small, black holes forming on its surface.  The darned thing was smoldering, burning from the inside out!  I pulled off the bag and doused it in the sink.  It was still hot as a pistol and I wasn't sure it was out, so I took it out in the yard and hosed the inside after unzipping it. I'm sure the air blowing through the bag fanned the smoldering fire quite a bit and sawdust (like any small particles suspended in air) can be pretty flammable. It really gave me a scare thinking about almost leaving a smoldering bag of sawdust unattended while I ate dinner.  Porter-Cable makes a terrific saw and this bag has saved me a lot of mess (although a fair amount sawdust still gets around).  The holes don't seem to let much more dust out so I'm still using it.

There are several cons with this guide, as well.  It is bigger and heavier than most guides, and more expensive, as well.  Using it requires more operations to put it together and set up.  It does not easily store on or in a workbench.  With those limitations in mind, I still rate it as very good and recommend it to any serious woodworker.",4.0

"For non latex paint, this tool is spectacular! But....
My house has multiple layers of oil based paint, topped by a layer of latex, which is peeling horribly.  Latex paint gums this tool up in a matter of seconds.  The best routine I have come across using this tool with latex is to first apply a chemical stripper to the latex. After it has set-up, scrape as much of the latex paint off as you can. Wipe the ""stripped"" surface down with mineral spirits, and allow to dry, about 1 day.  Then use the 7403 according to the instructions.  When the carbide discs do clog up (which they will), I use a wire wheel on my angle grinder to remove the gummed paint.  This needs to be done every 5 minutes or so.  It does not get the last 2"" or so when sanding up to a corner board or a window.  For this I use a 4"" 36 grit sanding disc on an angle grinder.
  This tool IS a beast.  It is quite heavy when using for any amount of time.  This is usually the case with any quality power tool though, usually a heavier tool equates to a better quality product.  You will find it necessary to wear a cannister style respirator, ear plugs, and goggles.
  The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the fact that it gums up.  It does leave swirl marks, so it isn't to be used for refinishig antique furniture, but all in all, I recommend this tool.  By far the best method for removing paint off clapboards.

This is a quote from the email I got from Porter Cable:
""It is recommended to keep a second disc soaking in paint thinner and a wire brush to
remove the clogged paint when you swap the discs.  Some customers use cooking spray
on the discs to keep the paint from clogging as fast but nothing will stop it completely""

But then you'll have oily wood that paint won't adhere to as well",4.0
"I rented this tool for two days, and I was able to accomplish more in that time than I did during two weeks of hand scraping and sanding.  The paint on my house is old oil paint which was very brittle, so I had absolutely no problem with clogging. This may also be because I chose the roughest grit on the carbide disk (the guy at the rental place told me they were less prone to clogging).  This tool very easily chipped off the old paint (1 layer) with only one or two passes. I had some difficulty with some of my clapboards which had a slight curl to them, but since there were only a couple of these I just hand scraped those. It does leave swirl marks, but these can be sanded out with a sander.  It IS possible to damage the wood if you slip, but if you're careful this won't happen too often. I was able to use it on a ladder, although not easily due to the weight, which is significant. You do need to wear eye/face protection because it spits up a blizzard of paint chips.  And like most power tools, its fairly loud- I would compare it to a circular saw.",4.0
"I haven't used this tool, okay?  I have needed to remove multiple layers of paint from window sills and a garage door before, and am looking to do so soon again for a different house.
I am hoping to find a tool that can do paint removal better than what I've used so far.  I thought I would post my experience here for others to learn from.
I've used a torch, heat gun, belt sander, finishing sander, and an air-powered dual-action disc sander.  I just wanted to post that if you want light weight, the air-powered dual-action sander isn't bad.  Use 50-grit sticky discs and plenty of compressed air (6hp and 230V is probably better.  I used 4hp/120V and paused to allow the compressor to catch up.)
The torch makes for larger, less windblown rubbish, but is somewhat slower and when I got annoyed sometimes scorched the underlying wood.",4.0
"ONLY PROBLEM is the weight!
I have been removing the paint from my 2 story, cedar shingled house with a 3 inch belt sander, part time since May (now August), with time off for an injury and the heat. Chemicals were too costly, ineffective and I did not want bad residue. I got 1 side done, some of another side, but the edge about 1 inch below each course was still left. Turning the sander sideways to get that area, killed belts FAST! The dust kicked up by the belt sander was terrible, going everywhere!!!!
I rented the 7403 for 4 hours. My results: tired arms, more paint removed and less wood eaten than the belt sander. This thing WORKS VERY WELL!!! It takes getting used to. So did the belt sander. It works MUCH FASTER (2 to 3 times) The rollers prevent gouging. It works better on flatter, harder surfaces. (My warped shingles are not as warped anymore) The areas where paint was sticking well to the wood went almost as fast with this as the areas with the paint flaking off.
I also found that it created MUCH LESS dust, that settled more directly to the ground. Belt sanding dust included wood that made it drift much further. Dust from the 7403, in a light breeze, was found to fly straight about 5 feet at ground level, drifting very little. The dust is denser. The particles fly faster off the work, ABSOLUTELY necessitating mask and goggles! Glasses were not enough at all.
Some paint buildup on the middle of the metal grinding pad, was easily removed when hot by fingers(with sander unplugged). The metal grinding pad distributes the heat evenly. It is cooler than belt sanding.
The belt sander will help to quickly touch up the light circular marks, once my skills are improved. There appear to be ways to adjust it to reduce the marks and/or making them go with the grain while maximizing the paint removal.

"Update (2014): I still have two of these. They sit more than they get used. They are top notch tools of the highest quality. No changes to add to the review below. Just letting you know that the tools and myself are still valid and this tool is still available new.

Original review (2002):
This machine works but is heavy, like other reviewers said. Myself and my coworker are each 6 foot tall men in good condition. We can barely put in 6 hours a day with the tool and that includes two half hour breaks to allow for muscles to stop spasming.
BUT--if used correctly, this tool does remove paint. It is slow, paint dust goes everywhere, and you must wear a respirator mask and a face shield.
Contrary to the instructions included with the tool...--read this carefully--There are little adjustable rails on the left and right side of the disc. The rails can be lowered and raised to adjust the angle of attack of the disc. I found that the ""cutting"" side rail (leading edge rail) of the grinder needs to be set to about 1/16 inch above the grinding disc (leaving 1/16th inch of exposed disc to do the cutting) and the back side rail (trailing edge rail) needs to be about 1/16 of an inch TALLER than the total depth of the paint you are removing. (The back rail should ride along the painted surface, keeping the trailing edge of the disc off of the paint by 1/16th inch.) In my case I am removing approximately 1/8 inch of paint (typical for an 80 year old house). Therefore the trailing edge rail should be set 3/16th lower than the disc, leaving the trailing edge of the cutting disc suspended, by the rail, about 1/16th inch above the painted surface. The cutting edge (leading edge) of the disc is exposed, preventing the rail from riding along the painted surface, about 1/16th of an inch.

The measurements are made by laying a straight edge (I use a square) across the disc and raising and lowering the black rails to the appropriate height. This is very easy.

Plan on using an inconspicuous place on your house and practicing for about 2 or 3 hours until you get it right. Don't give up. My first day was very frustrating. Lots of clogging. At first I could only use the tool for about 10 seconds before it totally gummed up. Uggh. But with practice, clogging (gumming) is actually quite minimal when you find the right ""angle of attack"" for your application. Gumming usually occurs when you hold the grinder in one place too long or try to cut too deeply in one pass. You can't expect to realistically remove more than about 1/64 of an inch per pass, maybe even as little as 1/128 of an inch per pass. This equates to about 4-6 passes, sometimes up to 10 passes for severely cupped and warped wood. But this type of use allows for almost constant grinding with very little gumming. When the tool does gum up use a small, wooden-handled ice-pick to ""pop"" the gum chunks off of the grinding disc. A cleaning session takes about 1-2 minutes or even less. An occasional brushing with a wire brush helps prevent re-gumming on paint covered, problem spots on the disc. This technique works so well that I only change the disc when the teeth wear down and stop cutting effectively (4-8 hours of use, depending). I have only soaked the discs in mineral spirits one time and generally find it unnecessary.
Beware--this tool pulverizes the paint into a fine powder that goes everywhere. You will need ridiculous amounts of plastic drop cloths and bricks to hold them in place. Then you must sweep the powder at the end of each day. The amount that you collect is astounding. You can expect to collect about 10-20 gallons of paint powder from an average, 3BR/2Bath, one level home. This must be done for both legal and ethical reasons. Would you actually dump 10-20 gallons of lead and enamel paint into your yard?
In closing--this tool works great. It is a bear to use. You must use scaffolding. It is slow. Expect about three weeks of all day work to get your old house scraped and ready to prime. Buy lots of discs, about 10 for an average size house. Use only the 24 grit as the discs wear out and you need all the cutting power you can get. But beware as a new 24 grit disc cuts viciously and leaves severe swirl marks. But after about 10 minutes of use it wears down to a manageable level.
If you can afford it--replace your siding. New poplar siding is about 15 cents a foot (in 2005. Prices fluctuate) in the US. Materials for an average home would cost about $4,000. Plus lots of labor. Vinyl siding is usually a poor choice. It costs $5,000, looks fake, and causes weird moisture issues between the vinyl and the old siding.
But if you, like me, have little money and lots of time--this is the tool for you.

"&#65279;I've been using the Porter Cable paint stripper for a  few days now. In short, this tool does a remarkable job of removing paint BUT, you will inevitably have paint build up on the disc - - so
get a few spares. Considering the other methods available, this is the way to go. I would also recommend reading the other feedback about the tool. I found it very helpful.
I have been using the tool to strip paint off interior window casings (circa 1934) that had several coats of oil based paint, the last coat of which was poorly applied (obvious drip marks, flaking, etc). On my first try, I completely stripped the paint off one 5 foot piece of casing in one pass. I was astounded. And, there was no gouging of the wood. The depth of cut can be so carefully adjusted, that I was able to remove individual layers of paint - - that was really something.
As per the other reviewers, I found that operating the tool at a slow speed and moving it  slowly over the material produced the best results and produced the least amount of paint build up on the disc. As other reviewers had said, don't force it; just guide it and let the tool do the work. There is no need to apply any pressure. Careful adjustment of the depth as per the instruction booklet is important. Also, the tool does turn the old paint into a fine powder so a respirator is necessary
(not just a disposable dust mask). Lead based paints are dangerous - - especially when they have been reduced to talcum powder consistency. Working outside is the way to go
With regard to paint build up on the disc,  I don't think you can avoid it. I may try a coating of silicon spray lubricant to see if it helps. After a while, my routine was to check the disc after each pass and remove any small deposits with a dental scaler, the stainless steel scraper they use when they clean your teeth. The idea is to remove small deposits before they get worse. It seems that once they get started, the paint deposits just get bigger and bigger. When the deposits were small,
a couple of quick flicks with the dental tool did the trick and kept the disc clear for a long time. But, once the deposits settle in, you're toast. Just change the disc. I use a propane torch to clean the discs and, so far, so good.
Because the window casings were from the interior of the house, the intact, unweathered, oil based, enamel paint really set the stage for deposits on the disc. Still, with care, I was able to go for awhile without the disc clogging. After I got the hang of it, I couldn't resist taking a pass at the siding on my garage. The paint on the garage had been neglected for a long time and the previous owner literally threw a coat of paint on it before the house went on the market.  After the first year, large flakes began to appear. Now, the whole thing is peeling. After a quick hand scrapping of one clapboard, I tried the tool on it with great results - - right down to the wood, revealing solid douglas fir siding. I think that kind of situation (neglect and weathering) is ideal for the tool. There's not a lot of substantive paint to clog the disc. And, the tool will remove paint and paint residue much better than just scraping and/or sanding and do it a lot faster.  I think I'll be able to blast through the whole building in pretty short order.
Overall, a great tool. The fastest and best way to strip paint from a flat surface. But, nothing's perfect - - the disc will clog with paint.  Bill W",4.0

The first one gave out and like many things in life these days...it's better to just get a new one than have it fixed.  The switch is what I BELIEVE went wrong with the first one.

Anyway, I loved the first one and used it to death, it has no dust collection capabilities but runs powerfully and shuts down quickly and protects your hand and arm from excessive vibration,

I would give it 5 stars if they would rethink the sandpaper clamps to make them easier...there is a little lever provided to give you more leverage on the clamps, but the lever is not attached to the sander making you keep up with it...not a horrible situation mind you, just mildly irritating.  The up side of the clamps is that they hold on to the paper for dear life!

"I am using the 7403 on a 102 yr old Victorian home that my wife and I are restoring. The 7403 works great until you get to the point where the latex builds up and gums the carbide disks. Shy of a heat gun (take it off the 7403 before using the heat), nothing really removes it quickly. I have a total of three disks and it seems that perhaps 6-8 disks would have been better. I keep switching them out as they gum up with paint. At the end of the day, I use the heat gun on all of them and clean up w/ a wire brush.
Our house has seven layers of paint and a layer of stain below that. If you have fewer layers, you will be most likely better off. A previous review mentioned fatigue, due to the weight of 7403. This is especially true of overhead use (under porches etc.). Plan on resting every so often or you will be sore for days on end.

"After reading many outstanding reviews, I thought it was necessary to add my thoughts. First and foremost, I have been working on my house for the  past few months. The exterior paint is in bad shape and to do the job  right, it is essential that the paint is stripped down to the bare wood.  The Power Paint Remover is the tool for the job.
First, I took the time  to completely power wash the house and get all of the loose paint. Second,  it was time for the Power Paint Remover. In no time, the paint was coming  off down to the wood. My disc did not clog up, nor did I have any problem  with the weight of the tool. I let the tool do the work without trying to  apply any extra pressure.
However, the tool is heavy. It is not a tool  that you will be able to use from a ladder. You will have to put something  together so you are always working just above or below eye level. Also, be  careful, you can easily scar the wood by applying to much pressure.
I  was fortunate to talk with the Porter Sales Rep at one of our local stores.  He said to make sure that you set one side of the disc slightly higher and  one side lower (this is clearly explained in the manual). I found 1/32 of  an inch will do the trick. If the disk to clog up, use a torch to burn the  paint or wood then clean it out.",4.0
"This is a really accurate easy to use router guide.  I wish I could figure out how to mount it to my skill saw for breaking down plywood.

The guide is easy to use, pretty intuitive, and does a very good job of what it is supposed to do:  guide the router.

I've used it with Porter-Cable 690 and 890 series routers and it is a cut above the old style with two rods.  It also works with the plunge base of the Dewalt 611 trim router.

The things I don't like are probably minor to most people.

First, if they drilled and tapped the open end, and put a plate there:  You would have a storage place for all the extra bits they give you to adapt it to different routers.  I bought this guide for use at work.  I've had the same guide for about five or six years now at home.  The pin to make it work as a circle guide was lost about a month after I bought the one at home.  One of the guys that works for me is a hobby machinist, so he is going to drill and tap the body, and make a plate for the end so we can store the extra parts in the guide.

Secondly, the indicator sleeve could use hash marks at the 45-degree points, which would let you adjust to the nearest 128th of an inch, and interpolate to the 256th of an inch.  Again the guy who works for me can make the change.",4.0

"This sander is excellent at sanding but if I cut a full sheet of paper into 4 equal pieces they do not fit well. The pieces are just a little to short to properly be held by both clamps.

"I'll admit that this is the best 1/2 sheet sander on the market and has been for 30 plus years.  Simple to use, vibration free, reliable as the day is long and a high quality finish are all part of what you are buying with this model.

So why have I given it a 4 star rating?  Two words, dust collection... or lack thereof.  For as long as this model has been on the market PC have still not given any serious consideration to how to effectively collect the considerable amount of dust generated by this tool.  There is a boot PC sells as an add-on that fits over the base.  However, unless your only sanding flat surfaces AND are willing to drag a vacuum hose around you can rule this accessory out.  Something, anything would help especially with so much dust control regulations being imposed by various government agencies, work place safety boards, fire marshals and insurance companies.

Other than that a great tool that will basically last forever.  Highly recommended.",4.0

works very well.  Vibrated much less than other hand held sanders I have used.  Holds sandpaper w/o slippage.  I like that it does not have a little 'for looks only' dust bag which is mostly in the way.  Sanders that have them also have lots of holes in the bottom of their sander pad which makes the sandpaper tear up prematurely even if you don't puncture them on purpose...,4.0
"I've only owned this for a couple of days, but I really like it.  I've used it for quite a few hours the other day.  I'm usually worn out from the B&D I'm used to, so this is a pleasant change.  This thing is really quiet, for a palm sander, that is.  I understand the issues with the needing of the tool, and the design of the clamp is pretty foreign to me, but it is something I've gotten used to.  Also, the pad is wider than the 1/4 sheets, so there is a minimal hangover, but no biggie.  I was kinda worried about purchasing this, but now I'm glad I did.  The design of the tool itself is much more comfortable than the standard design, I can go for hours.  I haven't been able to do that in years.  I hope this one works for a long time.",4.0
"this router edge guide is solid. its built well and works well as long as you move the router slowly so it doesn't jump off of the wood you are cutting.

I would recommend it for your porter cable router.",4.0
"This is a moderately priced router attachment.  It's easy to attach and relatively easy to adjust.  The adjustment is fine enough for most work on flat surfaces that fully support the router base.

If your trying to route something like the front end of a cabinet (thin, isn't wide enough to support the router base) the method you use is to extend the guide is to screw a piece of wood to the adjustable plate.  This plate can be thrown off because the guide plate shifts up and down because it doesn't meet the base of the router.  I solved this by attaching a piece of plywood for a guide and making sure it was fully up against the router base otherwise the fence can shift.

I've had the more expensive magic circle router jig (I can't remember the exact name) and it did more things that I never used.  It dropped it. It broke and I looked for something else, less expensive.  This jig is reasonably priced and does the job.",4.0

"I've had this router for about a month now and have no real complaints about it.  Some of the reviewers have complained about various things such as lack of power, broken switch, etc., but so far I've been suprisingly impressed with it.  Granted, as a plunge router, I feel you could do better, but it is a good all around router.  In particular it does well under a table. PC used some thought when designing were the variable speed control and the addition of a second power switch on the base was a nice touch.  I might add that I picked this router up new for .... on a ""going out of business sale"".  Had I not gotten such a good price I would have opted to purchasing the dewalt 2hp plunge.  All in all, it's a good router, if you can get it on sale.",4.0
"I have had my PC for almost a year at this point. The soft start, the plunge, the variable speed controls, the on/off switch on the handle and the micro-meter adjustment are all wonderful. The chip deflector will fall off every so often but it is okay as well. My only problem was the space age looking guide that I had to buy extra. It looked as if it would be perfect as it too has a micro-meter adjustment. However, the guide itself would never stay where it was set so the router wandered. Very dissapointed in this and wish PC would fix it. Without question, I would buy another one as the power is great as is the finish.",4.0
Use for assembling small picture frames. Work great for this application.,4.0
"I use my Porter Cable 7518 mounted under a table.  The speed control is essential, especially when using large bits.  The soft start and relatively quiet operation are big bonuses.  The only problem that I have is adjusting  the height:  This requires the motor to be rotated which can cause dust  that is accumulated on top of the motor to become lodged in the threads  that adjust the height, causing the mechanism to jam.  Once in a while I  have to unmount the router, remove the base and thoroughly clean.  Otherwise it easily beats other routers I've used.",4.0

What can one say about a wood biscuit? The Porter-Cable tool to use them is outstanding and very efficient. Sometimes a biscuit is a little bit oversize and has to be tapped into the cut-out. Stand back because glue will spurt everywhere if you happen to tap it too hard. The biscuit process is very good for joining boards to create a large surface but other joining methods such as special router cuts may be best for fine furniture. I have built common furniture with them and used them in areas that have shearing stress. They have held well and have not failed.,4.0
There is not much to say about biscuits. The do work very well and I have gone through about 500 of them with no problems. They seem to be very uniformed and I have not had a joint go out on me yet.

"My Milwaukee palm sander finally died after years of faithful service, and I replaced it with this Porter-Cable model after reading the reviews.  It is quieter than the Milwaukee and a lot easier on the hand because there's not as much vibration transfered to the housing that you grip when you hold it.  The placement of the ON/OFF switch is really nice since it's located right where your fingers are as you hold the unit.  You don't have to fumble around or look for the switch at all.  The only beef I have is the same mentioned by a couple of others.  Some have stated this is kinda lame, but I don't think so.  Unless you want to spend $6 for 15 sanding sheets, you're going to use a regular old sheet of sandpaper that you rip into four pieces, i.e., you're not going to use adhesive-backed paper.  In this case, you have to slip the paper under the clamping mechanism that holds the paper in place.  I can't imagine why Porter Cable didn't incorporate the clamp tool mechanism into the sander itself rather than supplying a separate tool.  Yeah, you can use a screwdriver, but hey for $100 can't they design a metal arm or finger that can be pushed or pulled to open the jaws of the clamps (like my old Milwaukee)?  That's kinda lame.",4.0
"I own quite a few sanders, and in my opinion this is one of the best, although not _the best_.

Other reviewers have done an excellent job on focusing on all the positives, so I won't waste time restating what they wrote.

For the price there are a few things that could be improved on:

1.) The old 330 has a metal housing, where as this one is plastic. Granted, on a cold day the plastic is probably more friendly, but I like the feel of the metal housing better.

2.) The new 330 isn't made in the U.S.A., where as the old one is. For the price, it should be made here.

3.) The new 330 is rated at 14,000 RPM, where as the old one is 15,000. This probably makes the brushes and bearings last longer, although the brushes don't seem to be the same quality as on the older unit. Either way, the extra 1,000 RPM helped a lot when trying to avoid swirl marks with a course grit. The 340 is also 14,000 RPM, but 1/2 the price.

4.) The new 330 isn't counter-balanced as well as the old, perhaps because of the lighter plastic case.

5.) The 330 doesn't have a dust collection system, unlike the 340. Granted, if you buy a 330 you probably have a downdraft table and don't want the drag of the vacuum hose to interfere with the feedback of the sander, but it would still be nice.

6.) You pretty much need the tool to install the sandpaper. Everyone I know (including me) who has a 330 uses PSA paper because of this. Bosch has an ideal setup on their 1297DK, which is also a nice sander, but 12,000 RPM.

With that said, this is still the best unit available for purchase that I've found. The hand grip is very comfortable, it's fairly quiet, and the vibration is low enough to not cause numbness after extended periods of sanding. Because of the price I'm giving the new 330 4 stars, although I'd have given it 5 if they kept everything the same from the old 330.",4.0
It is a powerful router and the soft start is a nice feature. It has some design problems. It does not have a spindle lock. It requires fumbling with two wrenches to change a cutter.

It sure is nice having a flash light that I always know there is a fresh battery in.  This is the case because I have multiple of the 12-volt DeWalt batteries and always keep one on the unplugged charger fully charged and ready to swap out for a dead battery. This flashlight is well balanced and feels nice in the hand and turns on and off easily with the thumb of the hand holding the light.  My only complaint is that it eats the battery up pretty fast. I am unable to make a run to the outhouse and back without the flashlight going dead (or at least very dim).  And I don't stay seated long.  I end up turning it off while seated.,4.0
"I gave it 4 stars - 5 stars for its usefulness and 3 for its build quality.  I have several cordless tools from different makes, so I'm not using up the batteries all the time like I'm supposed to from what I've read, but having this flashlight around helps me at least cycle through my DeWalt 12V batteries.  The flashlight has a lightweight feel to it without the battery installed, so it clerly doesn't feel as ""heavy duty"" or solid as, let's say, a drill might feel, but I figure what should I expect?  Maybe the yellow and black color scheme along with the DeWalt label makes me expect more?  But, heck, it's only a flashlight!  You can't vary the beam width as you can with a MagLite but you can pivot the head which has proven useful at least once.  Lastly, I'm not quite sure how I ever got by without a flashlight in the shop!  My final recommendation is that if you have a cordless kit from any make, get the matching accessory flashlight!",4.0
"If you already have a dewalt 12v cordless tool - this flashlight is great.  I always keep my backup batteries charged and I have good light whenever I need it.

It's fairly well built and will provide great usable light for more than 30 minutes.  The head of the flashlight rotates so that you can position the beam where you need it.

Should it be cheaper?  It used to sell for $ 34.00 and now costs $20.00.

Sounds like a good deal to me

Nice router but if I had seen ANYWHERE that it was not made in the USA I would have looked harder for one that is.,4.0
"Excellent router.  Nice motor.  The soft start is good.

Not critical but the bit changes could be updated.  I like doing things the old fashioned way and using wrenches to change the bits doesn't bother me.

We've used this to turn large paneling bits.  Most recently an enormous one that we had custom made.  It handles it perpendicular to the grain with as little strain on the motor as could be anticipated.

I'm knocking a start for safety.  I don't like that the switch is on the top of the router.  The top is proud of the switch, so if you set the router upside down, it won't hit the switch.  Still I see our carpenters often holding the router against themselves as the use the wrenches to tight the router bits in place.  I can't help picturing their bellies somehow hitting the switch and sending parts flying.  With good safety practices those parts will be wrenches and not finger tips.",4.0

"Great router for my Inrca LS table setup. Fits in the Incra Master Lift II with zero adjustments to the mounts. with one significant flaw. The collet on mine was exhibiting pretty extreme runout, varying by the position of the collet in the spindle, and how it felt like settling when clamped down with the nut. I thought maybe the spindle had runout, but I tried a quality collet/nut from Precise Bits and the issues went away entirely. Now this thing runs beautifully.

Runout isn't a huge deal with short/low diameter bits (as long as we're not talking about very small bits which may be broken by it), you may not even notice it.. But when you throw a raised panel or rail/stile bits in, get ready for some serious vibration. Also, if you do Incra style dovetails or box joints, any runout is going to make your cuts wider than they should be. With dovetails this makes it impossible to get a consistent dovetail tightness based on depth of cut.. so if you change bits and go back and try again with the same DOC, your results will be different. Sure you can cut test pieces every time but that's a huge waste of time and wood. I could never understand why I was having such issues and then discovered runout was the problem. Any dados you cut with a specific width bit will be wider as well.

The ultra precision collet set from Precise Bits makes the world of difference, plus the collet never sticks and requires you to back the nut off to get the release to pop.. just wiggle the bit and it slides free. It really brings this machine up to a pro level quality.

Hopefully most others have a good collet on their routers.. or don't do anything with it that requires high precision. I just wanted to share this so people looking for a solution might find it easier.",4.0
"I am in the process of making raised panel doors for my entire house with the 7815 mounted in a Kreg router table. It truly is a powerhouse and I don't feel it is overkill, after trying successfully but scarily to run the large bits with my smaller Bosch router. It worked, but I doubt it would survive the experience. This one, having the same power (amperage) as my Bosch table saw, glides right through maple. Someone mentioned the poor R&D response by PC to several issues with this router. I have not had a problem with the mode of adjustment, without a router lift, and with a mirror it is highly accurate and easy. But I do have an issue with the speed control slider switch. This is not a good arrangement as constantly I am finding myself bumping it when turning the router on and off, and it easily will unintentionally change to a different speed when touched while adjusting height. It simply is an inferior design for a router table set-up. The on and off switch also is not ideal for a router table set-up as you find yourself groping around, under the table, to find the switch. An auxiliary paddle safety switch is a very good idea which will take care of both these issues, until you again need to adjust the height by groping around under the table. Changing bits is not that difficult: one wrench under, the other wrench above the table. Easy.

Regarding the comments about it being difficult to release bits from the collet. I learned a trick that may help and has totally alleviated any problems for me. Loosen the collet to where you can turn it with your fingers. Then when you meet resistance loosening it with your fingers, use the wrenches again to back off a little more, loosening the collet further. Voila! The bit slides right out. This is a great tip!

4 1/2 stars, the 7518 loses 1/2 star for the poor slider switch and less than ideal on/off switch location.

Incidentally, me a router lift is no more than an extremely expensive and unnecessary (unless you are a production shop) item. $300 for a wee bit of convenience doesn't cut it for me unless I find a smoking deal on one. Plus, the bending over or squatting to change settings or bits is much-needed exercise! 1/64th inch incremental changes in bit height are a piece of cake with this router, without a router lift.",4.0

My only gripe is the electronic speed control.  It's first-generation and allows the speed to fluctuate when spinning big bits at low speed to cut raised panels.  I understand that some newer models do a better job at speed control.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.",4.0

"First, let me say I love this saw. Very strong for it's size and cuts plywood with great ease and precision. Unlike another reviewer, I find the fence to be just fine.

My two gripes are the small adjustment knobs on the fence and the power trigger. As a middle aged man with the beginning stages of arthritis, I find the knobs can be difficult to loosen, a little bigger or an oblong rubberized knob would be nice. My other issue is the lack of a thumb safety on the trigger. It's easy to actuate the saw just by picking it up if you aren't paying attention. I get used to it myself but others who may be using the saw on a big project with me have commented on it. If you are a lone woodworker that becomes familiar with it, I imaging you might view the lack of a thumb safety as a good thing, one less annoyance. For me, the lack of one is not a good thing for the general population.

I'll also mention that the blade choices for these are a bit limited so make sure you look into that at the same time you look at this saw.

For some of the negative reviewers here, perhaps you are expecting a lightweight trim saw to be as strong as a full size worm? If so, you are using the wrong tool. This is a great saw for plywood and trim, with the right (sharp) blades. If you want a saw you can fling into the box, toss around the job site, and power through ply with a dull blade, look elsewhere.",4.0

"I have Porter Cable tools which belonged to my grandfather.  And for the 70+ years that my family was in the industrial construction business, we used a lot of Porter Cable tools (when they didn't sprout legs and walk off).  So, when I learned that Porter Cable had been swallowed up by Black and Decker, I felt a little ill.  Because of the B&D connection, when I recently needed a router to hang under my Kreg table&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kreg-PRS1040-Precision-Router-Table-System/dp/B00002240Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kreg PRS1040 Precision Router Table System</a>&nbsp;,  I started looking for anything but this router.

However, after a lot of looking, it became clear that this is the de facto standard, and that lift makers pretty well assume that this is what you will use.  I did give a lot of thought to the Bosch, and I could have gotten pads for it to fit my lift&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kreg-PRS3000-Precision-Router-Table-Lift/dp/B002YIG578/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kreg PRS3000 Precision Router Table Lift</a>&nbsp;, but the pads that come with the lift are for the PC 7518.  Besides, I plan to do some things which could benefit from the additional power of the PC.

I don't see a lot of point in dwelling on what's good about this router, others have covered that, it is the standard, it is powerful, and it does not mind being run while hanging from the ceiling by its' toes (I'm told that they built it to run well upside down because they wanted to get good market penetration in Australia - but that could just be a rumor).

I bought the 7518 instead of buying the motor by itself in case I ever had a reason to run it out of the table.  But honestly, I'm just a belt and suspenders guy, I can't imagine ever using it outside of the table - it is just too big a beast, and what would I ever do outside of the table that requires this much power ? (Brief pause while someone tells me what I would do outside the table that requires that much power.)

I do not like the way the speed control is implemented.  Many years in the electronics field has left me with a real dislike of slide switches.  I think of them as a failure waiting to manifest itself.  And while I admit there may be some benefit to a stepped speed control in my application, I have a preference for continuously variable controls that I can tune to find the ""sweet spot"" for what I am doing.  As expensive as this unit is, I would like to have seen a solid state control.  If Porter Cable wanted to really address the upside down under a table market, a plug in remote speed control with continuously variable speeds and an rpm display would be the cat's meow.  Just make sure it is the real RPM, and not some fake number.  This wouldn't be a difficult improvement for PC to make, in fact, I have considered modifying my router to add it myself. Of course, when you have Black and Decker running the show, and you are selling the 7518 very successfully without it, why would you bother to update the product?

So, now that I joined all the other lemmings in going over the PC 7518 cliff, I'm pretty happy with it.  I wish the 1/4"" collet had been included, but I realize that this thing is capable of destroying a 1/4"" bit if you aren't careful, so maybe that was the logic.  I ended up putting a quick change on mine, so I have to use a collet adapter now anyway.

The worst thing about this router is that when you go to order parts on-line, you discover the terrible truth of what you bought - the parts department isn't Porter Cable, it is DeWalt !  Given the terrible reputation of Black & Decker / DeWalt service, I was pretty horrified to make this discovery.  The salesmen at one of the nearby ""Orange Big Box"" stores have repeatedly warned me about the bad service from these folks, and of course, DeWalt is one of their big brands (they recognize me as a very frequent repeat customer, so I get the ""come over here a minute - whisper, whisper, whisper"" dope, not the official party line).

Would I buy this router again? Yes, absolutely.

But, if there was a comparable router with the the features I've talked about, or which simply was not a victim of the Black and Decker/DeWalt evil empire, would I pick it over the PC ?  YES, ABSOLUTELY.

As a reviewer I have to be honest about this sander.  It is a real nice powerful sander and I find it on a par with my old Black and Decker as far as noise goes.

"I've had this sander for four years, and use it extensively. It has a good design, and is well built. It is light enough to be held with one hand for scribing, and stable enough for flat sanding.
On the down side - the dust bag is a joke. It never worked right, and tore and fell off after a month. It also gets hot after a few minutes of hard, constant use. But I've also had no down time with it. It handles well, and made to last. If you do a lot of flat sanding, I'd recommend a heavier sander. For all around service though, it's a keeper.",4.0
This a fine quality machine. It really is very basic and quite simple in its design. Although not as refined as some sanders out there this unit does one thing well. SAND.The ability to adjust the speed is a must on any sander. This tool will easily withstand the daily rigors of loading and unloading your work truck. I do recommend upgrading the sanding shoe and I wish porter cable offered that as a standard. From the rugged american craftsmanship to its simplicity and fair price this tool is a big hit. Two thumbs up on this one. Now get out there and sand something.,4.0
"I purchased this sander when they first came out.  The dust pickup is not as good as the older model. The dust inlet is located on top of the driver roller.  The older model (pre-whisper) had the dust inlet located at the  back, near the bottom, of the driver roller, which pckup a lot better.  The  problem is enhanced with the lower variable speeds.",4.0
"This is a fine router and I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that the speed control switch is a little flimsy.  The fit and finish are not up to the old PC standards.  I have several older PC tools (a router and two drills), some of which I bought in the late 70's, they were well built and after changing motor brushes and the on/off switchs they work as well as the day I bought them.  The construction of this router is not as robust.

  I bought this router to use only in a router table, I have a 3 HP Makita plunge router that I like, but didn't need the plunge feature in the router table.  Thus far, the PC 7518 has cut like a dream using both large and small bits.  I like the ""easy out"" collet, it is well designed, works as promised and is a great improvement over the old collets.",4.0
"The Porter-Cable 7518 and 7519 (it's fixed-speed cousin) are solid routers, but you should consider their advantages and drawbacks carefully before you buy.

Handheld, they are beasts, but that's true of all 15A (15 Ampere) routers. They weigh about 13 pounds, and using them is almost like weight training. That may be what you need in a production environment, where you'll beat the router to heck, but it's overkill for a home shop. For handheld use a 12A handheld router is plenty. The primary application for a 15A router is panel raising with large bits, an operation that should never be performed hand-held. (The Ampere rating is an indication of the power the router can safely deliver on a continuous basis without burning out. It doesn't describe the power the router normally draws, just the peak power it's capable of. With smaller bits, you'll never need the kind of power that a 15A router can deliver.)

The chief reason most of us would buy one of these routers is to use it under a router table. In my opinion, the best way to do that is to mount the motor in a router lift device. This enables you to adjust the router height from above the table, without lifting the router and router plate out of the table top (They're heavy and the handles nearly fill the opening, making removal awkward!) or struggling to work under the table. I recommend a router lift that can raise the collet above the table top to simplify bit changes. My choice was the Jointech SmartLift Digital. The JessEm Mast-R-Lift also raises the collet above the table, but I've never used it.

Even in a router table, you need 15A only if you're routinely spinning bits larger than about 2"", which are mostly horizontal panel-raisers. A 12A router is fine for most router table use. A 12A router won't last as long if you're using large bits, however.

I can't imagine why anyone but a production shop would buy the 7519. The single-speed feature may provide very slightly higher reliability but it greatly restricts the bits you can use. If you shop, there's no real difference in price between the two models. For almost everyone, the 7518 is the best choice.

Porter-Cable should be ashamed for their unwillingness expend any R&D on the 7518 and 7519. Nowadays, every router has a self-extracting collet, but these are the only routers I know that don't have a locking spindle and therefore require two wrenches for bit change. (PC's latest 2 1/4 horse router has an auto-locking collet, so how primitive is one that doesn't lock at all?) I'd also blast their cheapness for not including a 1/4"" collet. The location of the power switch on top of the motor housing can be awkward, since you have to remove one hand from the handles to cycle power.

When using the supplied base, the adjustment mechanism requires turning the aluminum-encased motor housing inside a huge aluminum screw in the base. (Few engineers would design with aluminum sliding on aluminum, particularly when the surfaces can't be lubricated.) Operation is rough and awkward, particularly under a router table. There's nothing to keep dust out of the adjustment mechanism, so the aluminum screw can collect grit, and under extreme conditions can jam. A router lift circumvents all these problems.

In summary, I recommend that you consider the 7518 and 7519 only if you'll be mounting the motors in a router lift. If you don't want to spend the money on a router lift, consider one of the newer routers that has built-in above-table adjustment. 12A routers are now available from Milwaukee (Model 5616-20), Porter-Cable (model 894PK), Freud (model FT1700VCE), and others. The Triton TRC001 is a 15A router that is reputedly excellent for use under a router table, but I haven't used it.

If you want a single router for use in router table and hand-held, buy a multi-base kit to make it easy to switch functions. It is very time-consuming to convert a table-mounted router to handheld use when the router is screwed to the router plate.",4.0

"A real power house no doubt about it.  I am only going to post my one comment, that is not listed in any of the other reviews.  Maybe mine is deffective maybe not.  I have mine attached to a router table  with a Jessem Mast-R-Lift.  When using a 3 ""  panel bit the varible speed is all over the place.  Now in defense I was doing free hand with no guide (NOT SAFE) and taking irregular size cuts off the wood. I wanted to see if it would get bogged down and how it would recover.  It has the power no doubt about it.  It just takes time for the electronic speed controll to tell its brain to speed up.  But remember anyone will tell you to take lots of smaller cuts rather than one big one.  So this may not be a long term issue.  Hope this helps.  BE SAFE.",4.0
"As a woodworking instructor I have seen three of these machines sustain quite a work load nearly everyday for the past several years. All three are still going strong despite the use, misuse and even abuse they take from high school students. They have far surpassed the longevity of other routers we have burned through in the past.  We have,however, encountered one problem in particular. That is the need for very frequent cleaning of the grooves that allow depth adjustment!  Once these become ""clogged"" with dust the machine can be very difficult to adjust. Which means that it is almost impossible to take apart to clean. I wish P.C. would come out with a way to remove the motor from the base without the need to unscrew it. This has proven to be a major design flaw. Otherwise, our machines have been great.",4.0

"I have not used this router much yet but what I have used it for has been enough to tell me it is a very good router. I use it mostly in a table. It is heavy and when used in a hand routing operation the power comes through well. I have discovered one thing to watch for on my other Porter Cable Router (690) which is very upsetting is the breaking of the screw nut combination which holds the router in its base. This screw has a plate on one end and a wing nut on the other end. On the 690 the plate separated from the end of the screw while I was routing which released the motor from the housing so the depth of the bit changed. That is something Porter Cable should really work on as the same screw -nut combination is used on this big heavy router. The plate on the end of the screw is seemingly nothing but pot metal and when talking to a pro, counter top maker about this he showed me a drawer full of these screw nut parts which he keeps on hand to replace when they break. This is a guy who uses his routers on a daily basis cutting Corean and other counter top materials all day long and he is used to these nut screws coming apart! Porter Cable should replace this part with a better one to assure protection from injury and damage to materials!! Other wise this is a great router. I suggest anyone with a Porter Cable router to get these parts before they break so you can replace them and keep on routing.",4.0

"I considered the single-speed model to try to save a few bucks.  Well, the first time I used this, I had to make a very light sanding to correct a blemish in an oil finish.  It would have been difficult to impossible had I not had slower speeds available.  This sander did the trick.  It loses a star because the dust collector ""canister"" is pretty flimsy.  It has a habit of popping off when you bump the sander against anything (easy to do inside cabinets), and mine finally developed a crack along the base, making it loose fitting.  But, since I usuall sand outside, I just leave it off and point the business end away from me.  Works fine.

"Great sander, just a couple of things could've been better. 1. Maybe having 8 dust collecting holes instead of 5. 2. The collecting cartridge vibrates off the unit which causes a mess sometimes.

I have duct tape to hold it on.",4.0
"A great palm sander, gives excellent, swirless results on everything I have thrown at it, including the entire bottom of my 25ft sailboat!  VERY comfortable to use.  Like other reviewers, dust canister was constantly falling off until I replaced it with a new canister assembly from PC and they seem to have corrected the problem (its REAL tight now).  The sanding pad wore out after about three years and was was easily replaced.  Overall a fine machine I would buy again.",4.0
"I have been using this sander for about 8 years and agree that it is very aggressive and prodices a very smooth surface for finishing. I have experienced the canister coming off during use.  I solved this problem by wrapping a heavy 1/4"" rubber band aroung the neck of the canister and stretching it over the back of the canister.  This is quick and easy and still allows for fast removal for emptying the canister.  The sanding pad does wear out from time to time.  I purchased a sheet of the hook material and cut out replacements for gluing to the bottom of the worn out pad.  This is a much cheaper approach than buying a new pad.",4.0
"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.
The top palm grip is comfortable, which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place, ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.
The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.
I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines, the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that, the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask, however.",4.0
"I've had my 333 for over a year now and am fairly pleased with it except for the dust canister. Virtually every time I use it, the hard, black canister falls off, bouncing on the floor and sending up a plume of very fine dust into the air. If you buy this product, be sure and get a respirator or some cloth dust masks. You'll definitely need it.
The sander itself is surprisingly powerful and, with the lower grits it is very aggressive. I personally prefer the hook and loop abrasive attachment.",4.0

"I purchased the DeWalt framing saw for a christmas gift for myself.  I was a little skeptical, after reading a few of the reviews here on amazon, and decided to look into wheather or not the saw would live up to the challenge of the jobsite.  Having worked with the M77's for my entire carpentry career I knew that they would be hard to beat.  We currently have 3 M77 and my DW387g on the jobsite.  Slowly over the past 6 months it has begun to see most of the action.  It has plenty of power, and my fellow co-workers have come to enjoy the smooth action, good balance and light weight.  The only real problem that I have found with the saw is that when making cuts on 5/8"" or 1/2"" plywood the saw is so light weight and the saw slides so smoothly that it is hard to make straight cuts, but who's going to see that on a roof anyway.  Overall the saw is very powerful, light, and easy to handle. The drawbacks are almost to light-weight, and I'm still worried about the gears stripping out someday.  Not a bad tool to add to the jobsite.",4.0

Together, they're really easy to hook up and suck about 50-70% of the dust.  It's length and flexibility really help as well.",4.0
"I have been impressed with this dust collection system. It was easy to install and works well on my 6"" dia. orbital sander.  Though some dust still escapes, it is a dramatic improvement over letting the dust fill your work area.  On the other end I use a 6.25 peak Shop-Vac QSP Pro and a Sears automatic power switch, which automatically turns the shop vac on when you start the sander. One note of caution, this dust collection system does make the sander harder to hold onto, especially when you are using just one hand.",4.0
"very nice addition to the saw,however i do not recommend the outriggers if its a saw you move alot,both outriggers add noticeable weight

I have used it with my Shop Vac,2.5"" connection and the supplied adaptor with no problem.  It also fits my new Sears shop vac.  I am satisfied with the attachment and bet it would work even more efficiently with the perforated pad and paper.  My only suggestion is that I wish they included cord attachment clips.

This support could have used a little more design time, it works but it is not great when compared to other brands.",4.0
"I bought this to use as a side support.  It is not perfectly flush with the table, but it doesn't matter to me because it holds up long boards until I can get them in position with featherboards, fence, and my hands.  In exchange for perfection, It slides easily against the body of my on-site rolling table saw and is out of the way and ready to roll.

It was easy to put together.  Just remember that it can be either a side support or an outfeed support.  The smaller bracket, rods, and support bar are for the side.  The bigger set is for outfeed.",4.0
Very useful for the Dewalt saw when cutting longer boards or plywood and not having to deal with the hassle of saw horses. The only problem is when you move he saw and collapse them in they do not lock in place and will slide back out.,4.0
These table extensions are nice to have when cutting a larger piece of wood and not having another set of hands to assist you. Setup is fairly simple. I did end up adjusting the mounting brackets by making the extension bind up a little to prevent the extensions from sliding out every time the saw is tipped over.,4.0
"This product was a very nice addition to my portable table saw. It goes on easy, does as it says and makes working with longer lengths of wood a bit easier.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it does flex some when running longer pieces across it and I wish it was made just a bit more heavy duty.",4.0
These work great however the dude feed falls out when tilting saw to roll around. If this had a wing but set screw on either one to lock into place it would be perfect. I put masking tape around the tubes to make a tighter fit and lock better into place.,4.0
Easy to install and works fine. Reason for only four stars is because they sage a little from weight; although I don't think enough to affect the cut.,4.0
How did I use the saw without these.  (My wife knows!)  Glad I bought them as they are very handy.,4.0
"It works.
(I cannot wax eloquently about something so basic and simple.)
The supports are easy to setup -- I spent 20 minutes to assemble everything.  Of the 20, I spent 10 minutes fiddling with the alignment to  get it exactly the way I wanted.
The only ""minus"" is that the  support sags a little bit when fully extended.  I could feel the sag while  cross cutting a long board.
Still, even with the sag, the support makes  it possible for me to cut long pieces.  I was making many 4"" pieces  from 6' boards.  The side support made the work quick and safe.
If you  can park your saw against a workbench, you can use your workbench as your  side/outfeed support (park the saw next to the bench at the correct  height); but, if you work without a bench, or want your supports attached  to the saw, this side/outfeed support kit is a must-buy.
BTW -- The setup  instructions mentioned that the saw's mount points lacked screw threads,  and that you had to use the included self-tapping screws with a drop of  motor-oil.  On my saw, however, the threads were already there.  After you  order the supports, you might want to check your table saw and see if there  are pre-threaded mounting holes.  If you don't see threaded mounting holes,  go find some machining/motor oil.",4.0

"This is one of the finest laminate trimmers I have used after fifteen years in the fine woodworking business. Easy one-handed operation, powerful and compact motor, and absolutely the finest adjustable base on the market is why I keep reaching for this tool and why I own two of them.  Like all carpenters before me, the lure of saving a few bucks on a lesser-quality tool was something I entertained.  Luckily, among our crew I was able to test-drive several brands and models (mostly DeWalt and P.C. 7310).  The second I picked up this model, I was hooked.  Using a well-crafted instrument is its own reward.  I am happy I spent the extra money every time I reach for this gem.  So why not five stars?

"The Long Haul review:
  It is now 2011 and I have owned this drill since 1998. It has given me great service. As a residential electrician and contractor is has made me quite a bit of money. The drill has cut well over an estimated 25,000 holes in 2x10 joists and 2x4 studs. It has performed beyond its design and ratings by powering 3- 1/2"" self-feed bits through doubled 2x10 southern yellow pine. Mine has reverse and the mechanical variable speeds. The die cast angle housing and collar is superior to Milwaukee's version in that it won't come loose and twist on you. It's quite a little monster workhorse.
  I can't give it 5 stars because it has some drawbacks. Trigger variable speed would be nice because starting a 4 inch hole saw can become a bit brutal and hairy if you don't hold the drill so it will torque away from you shoud the bit become jammed. It's all or none, in or out. But I do suppose a variable trigger would sacrifice some long-term reliablility. Secondly, due to its design I cant get it into as close of quarters as I like, but I see that there is now a Dewalt available with a design that is closer.
  Mine has only been service once, by me, for a cord changeout. (Edit: I shortened the original cord to 2 feet because I always need and extension cord anyway.) Parts seem to be readily available from Dewalt. I expect the trigger to go sometime (no matter what brand, if you use it a lot the trigger is usually the first to go behind the cord.) Trigger is $35.00 online. Comforting to know I can get service parts.

Update: One poster mentioned the case. I neglected that part of the review. Where would this drill be without the case? Kudos to Dewalt for including a quality case for this tool. It stores the drill and the all-important bits to make it handy. My case is just as old as the drill, and it hasn't broken, warped, or cracked.",4.0
"I am compelled to break a couple of Amazon's review guidelines in order to highlight the fallacy of another review showcased as of December 30th, 2005 in the top five slot for this product. The review I am referring to is ""You can get this product free!, December 28, 2005""  written by ""Humble Me"". The URL provided in the review re-directs your browser to [...] If you are a savvy consumer, you would look for the fine print of this deal. That would send you to [...] NOTHING IS FREE. READ THE FINE PRINT. Unfortunately, many people each year are misguided into believing fantastic offers are actually true. Shame on the purveyors of these tactics.

I gave this product four stars, as opposed to five only because the new version, DW718, is far superior to it's predecessor, the DW708. The new 718 crosscuts at 90 degrees up to 16"" and miter cuts up to 12"" at 45 degrees. The old DW708 falls four inches short of both those cuts. That alone is a significant reason to consider paying the extra money for the latest iteration of this product. Other improvements include positive bevel detents for common angles, 6-5/8"" nested crown moulding cuts, and 6-1/2"" upright base moulding cuts. Get an education of the many improvements to be found the new DW718 at DeWalt's website - [...] - they also have a video for the product that is worth a look.",4.0
"I've had my DW708 for almost 3 years now and I am very happy with it.  I love the capacity, ease of use, tool quality, the 12 inch sliding range is great for wide stock, and the locking stops are just where you need them.

The tool isn't perfect though.  I don't like the location of the alignment marker for the double bevel.  It is obstructed for shallow angles up to roughly +/- 15 degrees.  There also are not any postive stops for the bevel.  Lastly I have yet to find a laser system compatible with the DW708.

My complaints with the postive stops for the bevel, alignment marker location, and laser system have been addressed on the newer DW718 but it will cost you another $150-200.

For my purposes the tool has mostly been great.  It has run with no issues and will continue to serve me well for years.",4.0

"I've owned my chop saw for about 5 years now, and considering how much I've abused it, it still works pretty good.  The motor is pretty noisy now, but it always has been a little loud.  I won't use any other DeWalt power tools (except my table saw), so I buy Bosch.",4.0
"The DW708 is a great saw for miters that do not require perfection. On mine, when the split fence was set perp. to the blade, the other half of the fence was .007 out (V-shaped if you will). This doesn't cut it when building furniture. I had the fence surface ground at a local machine shop and all is perfect now. Out of the box, this saw may be good for mitering decking material or for cutting ends that are going to twist, warp and bend anyway. But, if you are looking for a precision saw for furniture building or cabinet face framing, expect to add another $300 fixing up the fence. I was a little disappointed at the quality, but I guess it's I should have not expected precision from overseas.",4.0
"I bougt this saw and then used it as my primary cutting tool when I framed a 2600 SF home.  It works great for framing and really improves your cuts while in many cases saving you the time of using the framing square.  The large 12"" diameter blade and the large cut capacity allow you to miter even big pieces of lumber.

I live in Washington and in this part of the country we frame outside even in poor weather.  This saw stood up to work in heavy rains, freezing temperatures and hot sun.  The blade that came with the saw also lasts quite a while.  I framed the whole house and the blade only showed signs of getting dull towards the end.

Many framers and carpenters I've seen who use this saw simply place it on the ground or a temporary work bench.  It's tough to get a good cut on a longer piece of wood if you do it this way so I highly recommend a miter saw stand.  The Dewalt stand is what I use.  It's better than nothing but it's pretty flimsy.

As for the cons...

If you're lugging this thing to a construction site every day and then throwing it in the back of your truck after work you'll find that it's heavy, bulky and akward to move.  I stored mine at the construction site in a steel shed for security and so I didn't have to lug it home every day.

Also, although the saw is great for framing, I've had problems using it to do millwork.  The 12"" diameter blade flexes a lot and makes it very difficult to get precise cuts in many cases.

The motor is powerful and will cut effortlessly through most materials, but it does bog down quite a bit when you do angle cuts through gluelam or versalam engineered lumber.",4.0
"Some of the reviews on Amazon make me suspicious of who is writing them.  I just read a review that was supposedly of this Dewalt but the reviewer spent most of his time hyping up the Makita.  That's fine, but his bad experiences with the DW708 were vastly different than mine and other people I know that also have logged quite a few hours with their 708.  For example, I found the 708 to be spot on right out of the box.  90 degree cuts are prefectly square, 45 degree miters, etc., all right on.  Some reviewers complained that the 708 is loud, but to my ears and to my DB meter, it's quieter than most.
I do agree with those that say the extension should be included at this price.  For me, it's not an issue since I set mine up on top of the excellent Rigid miter saw stand.  Whether you're a professional builder or a home improvement hack, a mobile stand like the Rigid is a great accessory, making it trivial to move a fairly bulky and slightly heavy tool around with ease.  There - I diverted my attention away from the tool I'm reviewing, showing that I can learn from others here...",4.0
"Obviously the guy below works for Makita or is a disgruntled Dewalt ex-employee.
I have this saw, it works as advertised and then some...it's solid as a tank and can stand up and beat any of the other 12"" Compound Sliding Saws out there.
When it gets to this level of equipment...it's up to your own taste.  Makita, Dewalt, Hitachi, etc.  They all have something the others don't.
It's up to you to go to your local store, check out the equipment and then decide which one you want to buy.
I made my decision to purchase the DW708 and that is one awesome saw...cuts are straight and no loss of torque when cutting through tough wood...and the build quality is top notch...except for you ladies out there...watch out for those burr edges...
As for clamps and such...I can't remember how many times I actually stopped and clamped a piece of lumber while at a job site...if you have that kind of time...God Bless you.
that's my humble unbiased review...",4.0
"I purchased this saw 11/23/03, and took it to the dewalt service center the following saturday because the table was not flat. Since i had already sent off my reciept for the yellow and black payback before i discovered the problem and had no reciept to return it.
Two weeks later i picked up the saw wich dewalt installed a new base on it, and when i got home the first thing i did was put my straight edge on the table, guess what it still was not flat!
So being a Tool & Die maker by trade i took the fence off the table, It is not the table that is not machined flat, but the bottom of the fence which is fifty times more rigid than the base. So when the fence is bolted to the table it pulls up the ends making it not flat. So i machined the bottom of the fence so it was flat and now i have a saw that is by far the best saw i could have bought for the money.
I ould only give it 4 stars since i had to do Dewalts job to fix it. The box says MADE IN THE USA WITH US AND FOREIGN COMPONENTS. For the money there ought to be some QUALITY CONTROL somewhere don't you think!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But by the way yesterday 12/17/03 not even a month since i purchased the saw i recieved my free 18 gage brad nailer for the yellow and black payback. A nice early Christmas Present.",4.0

Bulb Worked Perfect in my Milwaukee M12 Flashlight. Just wish bulb was brighter. Still Cant Figure out why Milwaukee dose not make a bulb.,4.0
"The official DeWalt sealed packaging says that the bulbs are made in Japan. Amazon's packaging was sturdy. I included a couple of pictures. The filaments look nearly perfect as you can see. I do some serious soldering. The filament connection looks strange to me, but others can judge for themselves. Overall, the bulbs/packaging looks fine, buying this product is a bright idea. Plan to use it in my Bosch 10.8/12 volt flashlight.

Good luck and have fun.",4.0
"When I bought the light many years ago It worked great and was plenty bright.  I took to strapping it onto the handlebars of my bicycle (with a pad to prevent damage) for commuting home at night from work.  I really like the quick forty five minute recharge cycle and I have two batteries so is easy to change out.

No other bike light I have found at any price comes close to that quick charge and simplicity.  Anyway . . . the bulbs eventually went after LOTS of use and I went looking for new ones.  At my local tool supply I found them and headed for the counter.  NINE DOLLARS ! ! ! !  (for two bulbs; now ten plus).

That's stupid I exclaimed !  For twelve volt flash light bulbs.  I can get the same thing at the local mom and pop hardware store for less than a dollar each; dollar sixty nine tops.  Five dollars each from Dewalt what a mark up !  Thievery !  etc., etc., etc., etc.,

OK I am singing a different tune now.  I just ""invested"" in two genuine Dewalts after several years of using the hardware store ones.  Partly because the cheep ones are getting hard to find and because I remembered the light being plenty bright back when new and hasn't  seemed that way for a while now.  Even allowing for the darkening that happens to the glass on the bulb over time

I put in the new bulb and ran it for a charge worth.  Quite a difference.  The light out put is whiter than the basic cheep bulbs, the spot on the road is larger for the same pitch, it actually seemed to get brighter on the second use even though the battery was lower annnnnnd it ran longer than with the cheep bulbs for the same charge.  I can say that because the run time is within a minute or less for each commute period.  I guess I am back with Dewalt bulbs for the difference they make.",4.0
"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee, unbelievably, does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.

I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because, in my first shipment, one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.

This is an ""XPR"" = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered, while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star).",4.0
"The Dewalt has taken center stage in my basement shop, right across from my table saw. The Dewalt has the most cutting capacity on the market and the double bevel is extremely handy. Sure beats flipping long mouldings around. Bevel cuts are repeatable on both sides of the saw using the positive stops. For bevels greater than 45 degrees, I recommend the old fashion way; A table saw with a miter gage or a block plane, as this feature on the Dewalt ...No complaints on accuracy.
Pros:
I Love the cutting capacity of the slider and the tall fence is great, just remember to slide it out of the way on miter cuts. I also like the 15 amp motor, plenty of power. Slides smoothly.
Cons:
The blade it comes with is a throw away, but I saved it for grunt work. My base is not machined level and I have to wedge shims in the back to prevent the saw from rocking (It is bolted down). The accessories could have come with the saw at this price. It throws sawdust everywhere.",4.0
"I'll just hit the major points:
- Very solidly built.  Very stable.
- The electric brake is so much more convenient than I expected.  You can switch out workpieces within about 2 seconds of a cut.  Now my table saw bugs me because it takes so freakin' long to spin down.
- It should have come with at least some worthy accessories.  The vertical clamp (DW7082) would be a good choice, IMO.
- The dust bag is completely worthless - without a vacuum-assisted dust collection system, sawdust rockets out the back of the machine.  Even with a vacuum-assist, you'll be sweeping up afterwards.  If this is really an issue, maybe sawing isn't for you. (*laugh*)
- The depth-stop system is shady.  If you press a little harder than ""last time"", the saw will bow down a little more.  It's very inconsistent.  Don't depend on it for a ""real"" dado.  That said, it is very convenient if ultra-consistent depth isn't important for a given task.
- The over-45 degree angle cuts are more a marketing gimmick than really useful - it takes more than trivial adjustments to bring this setup around.  And then you have to un-do everything to get the stops back to 45.
- When I was researching this saw, I read several complaints about the sliding arm bearings ""shifting"" or being a shaky (which would result in inconsisent cuts, of course).  These people obviously do not read manuals.  Just adjust the bearings using the tool in the back of the arm.  It takes maybe 30 seconds to do a very thorough job of getting the sliding arm very tight (tolerance) and exact.
- Yellow is a good color for tools.
- It comes more-or-less set up.  It's always a little disheartening to open up your new tool to discover a bunch of metal bits and a few baggies of screws.  You can make some sawdust within a few minutes of opening the box.  It did take some adjustment to get it to where I was ready to *use* it, but nothing major.  A minor point, but still pleasing.
- The handle being perpendicular to the blade and shifted towards center makes it not only more ergonomic, but also you can cut with either hand.
- The fences are very nice - they are tall, very sturdy and stable, and adjust/remove with only one wing-bolt.
- Of course the dual-bevel is great (though, honestly, gratuitous - still, I'm a fan)
- The cam-action miter base is superb.
- The adjusty-tool stores right in the back of the arm.  Very convenient.
- The included saw blade is mediocre.  It's great for chopping 2x4s or something, but it's not appropriate for ""pretty"" lumber.
So - I really like this saw.  If there was a 4.5 star option, I'd go with it.  If it was less or came with accessories (other than that dust bag), I'd give it 5.",4.0
"I've built this saw into where my old radial saw used to live in my professional woodshop, but easy enough to take to a job site for framing. It's relatively smooth and quiet, does all it's supposed to do, but I have twice made the oh-so-easy mistake of doing a compound cut without sliding the tall fence clear. The second time it tore the fence right out of the slot. BANG! I was digging aluminum shrapnel out of my throat, and ruminating over a brand new but ruined 12x80 Dimar blade. I suppose the good thing is the saw still works ok after some slight adjustments, so it isn't too weak in the arm, but it would be nice if they could figure out how to avoid this risk, and improve the dust pickup.",4.0
"I owned the C10FS for several months (it's a good tool) but then sold it to buy the DW708. Here's why: better capacity, more power, better fence (try to find a C10FS on a jobsite that still has those cheesy plastic things), better guard (ditto... most carpenters jam or remove the Hitachi guard), accurate, readable and repeatable mitre setting (try to set 1/4 degrees on the Hitachi), a bevel left feature that actually works (banging my knuckles on that stupid knob thing was the last straw on the C10FS), and bevel stops that adjust with a single wrench instead of using a hokey jam nut system. The dust seals on the slide rails are rubber and work better than the felt ones on the Hitachi. The camlock mitre adjust takes a little bit of getting used to but works very well. The only caveat on the DeWalt is the big blade, and that was the original reason I went with the 10"" Hitachi. I had bought a DW705 (12"" chop box) when they first came out and still use it to frame, BUT the 12"" blade deflected way too much for finish work. The solution is to spend the $$ for the Forrest chopmaster blade (actually two of them so you can keep them sharp) as the DeWalt, Freud et al 12"" blades are a waste of money. Another very worthwhile (although too much $$) accessory is the quick-release clamp, which switches sides and adjusts VERY quickly.",4.0
"I got this when I began working on a rental house owned by my mother.  This was very useful because it let me work at night when I'd otherwise have to shut down.  The use of common batteries with the other Dewalt 18V tools is what makes it so useful.

I use it as an area light, bouncing off light-colored walls to light up an entire room (and it is a little dim for this).  I still carry a flashlight as a backup and I'd recommend the same to anyone using it at night, since you may knock it over, plywood may fall on it, et cetera.  It can be used for task lighting.  I suspect that the other Dewalt 18V flashlight might be better for that, though.

The design of the light, with the flexible neck, lets you set it up in all kinds of positions.  The advice given in another review - set it on its side - should be taken to heart, as I think that's the most reliable way to use it.  Setting the light on the battery base and extending the neck can make it unstable.

But this is a very useful light which can be used in many, many ways.  I think that, because it's so useful, one is tempted to use it just a little bit beyond its ability to balance itself.  With that caveat, highly recommended.",4.0

I won a Dewalt DW421 in a contest about 5 years ago.  I traded it in and paid the difference to upgrade to this sander.  The first 2 or 3 failed out of the box with motor and/or gear problems.  After finding one that performed properly I put it to the test.  I have used the 7336 with the dust collection system to sand cultured marble sinks and smooth walls that I had recently plastered.  The dust was minimal while using my shop vacuum.  It performs very good to excellent in sanding both soft and extreemly hard surfaces.  This is one of the best investments I have made in my shop!,4.0

There is a little less handle orientation adjustment than Makita however this thing is a whole lot tougher than the Makita. It's a brute that I am very happy to have. Works as expected of a Dewalt. I want to buy another chuck so I can rapidly switch between angled and straight.,4.0
"My construction class purchased a DW708 two years ago.  It was a breeze to set up, with little tweaking for a perfect 90 degree cut.  It is great for lumber 2x4 and up.  Also the blade included is great: when we made our first compound miter, we forgot to adjust the fence.  The blade sliced right through the fence and the 2x10 we were cutting.  We took the blade off and not a single tooth was damaged.  I would reccomend this saw to anyone who needs to cut large pieces of lumber.  However, if you are doing trim work, go with Makita's LS1013.",4.0
"I HAVE HAD THIS SAW FOR 16 MONTHS AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.  I BOUGHT IT TO USE IN THE PLACE OF A RADIAL ARM.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE CUTTING CAPACITY AND ITS POWER.  MY BROTHER-IN-LAW HAS A 12"" SLIDING MAKITA THAT I DO NOT THINK COMPARES. I NOTICED THE MAKITA HAD ALOT OF TORQUE REACTION THAT I FOUND TO BE VERY ANNOYING.  THE MAKITA ALSO DOES NOT HAVE THE NICE POSITIVE STOPS AND LOCKING MECHANISM THAT THE DEWALT HAS. THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME FROM GIVING THIS SAW 5 STARS IS THE DUST COLLECTION. I HERE THAT THEY HAVE CHANGED THE DUST COLLECTION ON THE LATEST MODELS.  I WISH I COULD CHANGE MINE BECAUSE THE DUST COLLECTION ON IT IS JUST ABOUT WORTHLESS.  OTHER THAN THAT THIS SAW IS ALMOST HEAVEN!",4.0
"Let me start out by saying I'm pretty much a newbie woodworker. I've heard good things about the DW788S from a guy at work and decided to take the plunge. I ordered the version with the stand and light attachments. They came in three different packages.
The stand was surprisingly heavy and assembled easily. A minor detail is that when the saw is mounted it seems to be a little top-heavy. I think that if you're clumsy like me and bump into it hard, it could go over. However, it doesn't seem in any imminent danger of falling. The light assembly is sturdy and mounts easily with two screws. It does need an extra outlet to plug into.
As far as the saw goes, it is nice. I found virtually no vibration just like others have said. It cuts quickly and accurately. Being new to scroll saws I was amazed at how tiny the saw blade is. At first I thought it was a piece of wire in the bag of parts. I've cut some 1/2"" MDF, 1/4"" ply and some 1/2"" walnut. The cuts are smooth and as accurate as I can follow a line right now.
One thing I don't like is the blade attachment. There is a thumb screw at top and bottom that holds the blade. When you tighten a blade, the screw has a tendency to twist the blade out of vertical. Now I put the blade in crooked and the thumbscrew will straighten it. Like many others, I'm not too crazy about the hold down, but it does work and is actually pretty easy to adjust.
A nice addition would be some kind of vacuum attachment. I rigged one up with MDF and a spring clamp that works OK, but misses a lot of sawdust.
Overall, it's a real nice tool, solid and accurate.",4.0
"I am overall very pleased with this product.  Cuts well, nice features, packaging and instructions generated no complaints - for the saw.
The stand was another story.  It is tube steel construction, when I unpacked it, the tubes were dented and would not fit together without cleanup.  It was not of the same quality as the saw.",4.0
"I am the owner of the DeWalt DW788 20"" variable speed scroll saw and am very pleased.  I've been scrolling for about 20 years, so I feel qualified to evaluate this saw.  I previously owned a Delta, which was a good saw until I burned it up.  The DeWalt  has some great features, among which is the fact that it has cut down the vibration considerably ( in comparison to other saws), has placed ALL the important contol features up front and within easy reach and without having to used any kind of tools.  The adjustable height on the stand is a smart move.",4.0
"I am a beginning scroller.  I read a number of product reviews in wood magazines and saw several of the models I was interested in demonstrated (and tried them too).  I was interested in ease of use and dependability.  The Dewalt has lived up to my expectations in every way.  Set up was easy,  and blade changing simple.  Cuts are smooth.  There are better, and more  expensive, saws out there, but for the money, the DeWalt is a GREAT deal.",4.0
"I have had this saw for over a year now, but I only used very briefly until about 3 months ago. I had a major remodeling project done in the house and I used saw heavily on cutting Brazilian cherry floor planks, walnut for the trim, and some moldings. I never used other miter saw or sliding compound miter saw before this one. So my review is solely based on using this saw. When I bought it, I wanted the best based on my own research on the subject. So here is my findings from the use of saw and hope it will give you what you looking for in a tool review.
The GOOD:
  Works out of box, no assembly needed.
  Clean balanced move on the sliding rail (back and forth) and head (push down and let it up).
  Miter adjustment easily and lock down handle works well and tight.
  Easy to read miter degree marks.
  Cuts bevel nicely once set. Stock blade works well. Better, smoother result with better blade.
  Easy to change blade.
  Very good ergonomics on the handle and switch position.
The BAD:
  Has to be careful with the fence extension when do bevel cutting.
  Need to take the extension fence off for certain cuts.
  Hard to read bevel scale.
  Tape the wrench in its hole or you will need replacement soon.
  Loud, very noisy loud.
  Don't use top handle since it's out of balance no matter where you secure the rail.
The UGLY:
  The dustport gets nothing but dusty.
  No dustbag, well, like it works anyway. No support extension.
  No hold-down clamp.
>Don't take me wrong. I like DeWalt tools even often the times I found they are over priced. I do own their planer, table saw, biscuit jointer, jigsaw. But like any other quality tool maker, there is always room for improvement. This is a high quality saw and I will keep it for a long time.",4.0
"I bought this saw around 8 months ago and have used it both on contruction projects and fine woodworking jobs (oak, ash and walnut). The Dewalt cuts through everything I have thrown at it very nicely including the 6/4 oak.
I have two relatively minor complaints. As others have noted, the dust collection port on the saw is a joke. The other problem I have had deals with trying to read the bevel gauge. At 90 degrees, it it nearly impollible to get a straight view of the hair line in order to line it up directly on the 90 degree line. Fortunately, it is easy to use a compound square for this setting in lieu of the gauge. My list of two flaws didn't include the depth of cut adjustment (it doesn't work) only because no one should buy this saw to cut dados anyway.
All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase. I attached the saw to a mobile stand (the Trojan) and bought a better blade than the one provided when I am doing fine cutting. The blade that was provided works fine for rough carpentry projects.",4.0

The light in the kit isn't very versatile, so I bought this one.

The light and flexibility is definitely useful, but it isn't as bright as you would hope.  I think the flexible arm will eventually become brittle and break also.  I used this a lot in my attic and it worked great, much better than the light mentioned from the kit.

Pros:
- Flexible and versatile
- Bright enough most of the time
- Fairly lightweight
- Long lasting

Cons:
- Heats up after extended use
- I think the flexible portion will fail eventually, it feels like it will wear itself out
- Heats up over extended use
- Brightness is OK

Overall this is a good light, I will upgrade to LED when I need to",4.0
"The only two ""faults"" I have found are as follows:
The dust collection fails miserably in capturing dust.  The bag collects only a small portion of the dust produced.  A waste of $... if you ask me.  Even when hooked up to a vacuum, it collects very little dust.  Plus, another annoying feature is the yellow band of paint around the outer circumference of the saw blade, which leaves a yellow stain on oak boards.  Everything else about the saw is great.",4.0
"I bought the DW 708 3 months ago and have used it extensively since then primarily building oak furniture.  Prior to the Dewalt  I had a Ryobi 10"" non-sliding miter saw that labored when sawing through 6/4 white oak.  The Dewalt cuts through it like a hot knife through butter, yielding a smooth cut with minimal tear out.  The sliding mechanism is smooth and the miter presets seem very accurate. The only criticism I have of the saw is the dust collection port on the saw is small and relatively ineffective.  With a powerful dust collection system attached I imagine I manage to collect about 25 - 30% of the sawdust generated - not particularly good performance.  I have overcome part of the problem by placing a floor sweep collector on the workbench behind the saw.  This has increased my total collection to about 75%.  Never the less, the positives of this saw far outweigh the negatives and I highly recommend it.",4.0
"This is my fourth compound miter saw and my third sliding compound miter saw. This saw allows piece of mind. You basically know that this saw will cut whatever stock you have, within reason. This is a very good tool, it is thoughtfully designed and has some real advantages and falls slightly short in only a couple of areas. The BOSCH 3915 ( 10"" SCM ) is a fine tool, but only bevels one way, its toggle clamps are quick and easy to engage ( more so than the DeWalt vertical clamps, which are still effective ).I prefer the cast in angle markers on the BOSCH over the DeWalts painted on gauge or Hitachi's C10fs which are too hard to read because they are painted the same seafoam green as the base and they are too small. The detents on the BOSCH are superb, the DeWalt's are also very good, and the Hitachi's are not as plentiful or crisp. The cam action lock down on the DeWalt is great, but the BOSCH's screw type works very well because of its large knob, much easier than the smaller Hitachi's. Regarding the cam lock on the DeWalt, I was really impressed how well it locks down even a degree or less next to a major detent. The adjustable fences on the Dewalt are superior to the Bosch's which only one side moves, and the Hitachi's are too short to be very useful. For the most part the BOSCH has a very nice base, but the direct drive motor and mount is fairly old technology. The Hitachi is a nice and fairly compact saw with a great motor, very smooth start up, but the base needs updating. The DeWalt is a great compromise. It does not fall way short in any category that I can see based on owning the other two saws mentioned. The accessories not being included is a little disappointing, I believe that for the price of this saw DeWalt could atleast include the dust bag. Generally speaking though, I believe this saw is woth every nickel when you consider the other saws are very good, but have distinct shortcomings, the DeWalt really does not in my opinion. I have mounted this saw on a mobile custom cart with locking wheels and storage beneath, I mounted the the Rousseau extensions and stop system on my cart and it is extremely solid and useful. So far, although not perfect - this saw is the best of the current choices. Hope this review helped you.",4.0
"This machine does a fantastic job of making my cars look their best. My only complaint doesn't even involve the machine it'self. But, the fact that I had to search all over for the accessories to use the machine. Once I got everything together I am trilled with the results.

"For over 5 years, this has been my go-to tool, whenever  I needed to do some sanding.  It puts palm sanders to shame and my belt sander back in the box.  I have also used it with a wool bonnet to polish my car, at lower speeds.
I would have rated it 5 stars except it is starting to die.  The variable speed dial only revs the machine up half way, which is too slow for sanding.  I plan to buy another and hope that Porter Cable (and Milwaulkie!) will start using better switches and variable speed controllers.
BTW, I have also used the dust collection kit that Porter Cable sells for this sander and would rate it 2 stars.",4.0
I use this product to polish and wax my car and I am very happy with it. The multi-speed settings allow you to make sure you don't over-do-it and keep control. Its fairly comfortable to use and you don't fatigue too quickly with prolonged use. My car has never looked better.,4.0

"I have had several Radial Arm Saws in the shop for years.  I got this Dewalt Sliding Miter saw as a modern replacement (substitute).
I have had the saw in operation for about 60 days now. The primary advantage is in the ability to saw while pushing towards the fence.  You can do this with the RAS but it is tricky getting the stock in place.  The 708 swings the blade downward to the stock. This is very helpful when crosscutting wide sections of hard maple.  The saw comes up to full speed and down to a halt very quickly ( less than one second).  it seems to have plenty of power.
The miter stops are OK for general use; but you will need to measure and clamp for precision  work.
The saw is not effective without both a long support table both left and right. I am a short person and setting the compound tilt requires my walking around the saw.  I can't reach over it to the knob on the back.  This is awkward with the long support tables in place. The dadoing (depth adustment) is useless. It is just a little screw that bears against an unsound part of the frame.  12"" is probably as small as I would go for blade size.
There is a dust port; but almost no dust either naturally nor with vacuum attached; goes out this port.  You will need to adapt your shop dust system to collect dust as it exits, fairly straight back from the blade.
My shop is not a construction site, so I have not exposed the DeWalt to the rigors of those tasks.  I am happy with this tool; but alas it is not the perfect tool....",4.0
"I am a hobbyist. I've been slowly accumulating tools over the past few years and building a small woodworking shop in my garage. The DW708 is my dream tool. Simple to use, ...accuracy without pain.
I now use my table saw far more effectively (not trying to make it do everything) and I will skip buying a radial arm saw, saving money and space.
At [this price] Dewalt could have thrown in the dust bag.  I took a star of the rating for the consumer-unfriendly lack of accessories.",4.0
"This is a fine saw.  It has been an acurate work horse since i bought it six months ago.  The standard blade was ok but required upgrading for fine trim and furniture work.
This this is BIG.  It's not especially heavy, just big. It takes up much more room that a standard miter saw. The sliding mechanism is the primary culprit. The old saw stand in my shop, is now a laundry cabinet in the basement.  I had to build an all new, BIGGER, cabinet.
It takes up about as much space as a Radial Arm Saw.  It costs  more than than a RAS.
I not unhappy with the performance at all.  It does require the new cabinet for cutting large stock.  The stability on heavy wide stock as demands the unit be anchored well too.
Make sure you need a sliding miter.  You may be better off with a RAS and a standard miter saw.",4.0

"I've tested many different laminate trimmer kits that are on the market and have found the porter cable deluxe kit to be the best value for the money. The four different bases that come with the kit allow you to do most  any kind of trimming with precision and comfort. The undercut base is  especially usefull for making perfect seams on large counter tops. when  adjusted properly the seams almost dissapear. The porter cable router  itself is smooth running with very little vibration as compared to others.  The only down side that I can see is changing the bases can be somewhat  combersome and time consuming, however, the added time it takes to change  the base is offset by the amount of time it saves by doing the job faster  and more accurately.",4.0
"As usual the tool has a good feel to it.  My granddaddy would say it is built hell for stout.  My only complaint is I expected a little more in the way of examples of each part in use.  The examples of how to set-up each  attachment are clear, but how you use some attachments are left to the user  to figure out.  Also the bits that came with my trimmer are not the ones  listed in the instructions.  They are 1\4 and 1\8 inch bits but I am unsure  if you need the bits listed in the instructions because a different grind  on a bit makes a lot of difference where the cutting takes place.  The two  bases I did figure out (standard and offset) worked as expected out of the  box.  I am sure this is another tool I will use and pass on to my Son.",4.0

Cons
Far too light on the base, I am contemplating filling the open spaces in the base with body lead. Using regular dewalt 18v's the light will fall over alot if it isn't positioned with care.  I'd gladly have a 5 pound base if it meant i could hang the light head wherever I wanted.

"When I bought my Platinum Ed. Delta Unisaw, I quickly realized that good  support was an absolute necessity in ripping long stock and panel cutting.  After much research on Outfeed Tables the unit that realy shined over the  others was the 50-302 Delta. I decided against making my own table because  by the time you add up a bill of material's w/hardware, it was just about  comparable to purchasing one. Assembly and direction's were straight  forward easy to follow respectively. It took me about 3  hrs. to assemble.  The instructions suggest 2 people are needed for assembly but I honestly  didn't have any problem's by myself! Here are the Pros and Cons as I see  them:  Pros:  Fold down of the table via  piano  hinges saves space for small  shops  Easy to assemble  Color blends in well w/Platinum  Unisaws  Sturdy and supports heavy stock  Will fit a wide variety of Saw's  Tables are completely sheathed  for less warpage  Pre-drilled screw holes were  matched perfectly  J-hook leg take-down takes only  seconds to do.  Cons:  Delta should add an extra  leg to bring support to 100 %  instead of 95 %  The hardware (nuts & bolts)are a  bit of a puzzle to properly  orient  The  tables should be shipped in  a more substantial box; mine  had a  crushed-in corner during  shipping. Delta should pack and  ship like  Biesemeyer does.  Overall I think this is a quality, versatile and  large support table for those of us lacking space in their shops. I would  recommend this outfeed to anyone who will be needing solid support of stock  but do not need a ""permanent"" outfeed. Try the Delta 50-302 with  your Unisaw and you will never regret it!",4.0

Have easily paid for the second sander in savings on sandpaper. Sander is easy to hold and allows light sanding or hogging.",4.0

"I sure do like this light. Light is bright, and lasts a pretty good long time. The only thing that I didn't like about it is that if you set it down on the battery, and raise the lamp up and point it down, it becomes unbalanced. but...that doesn't hinder my using it...love the light.",4.0
"Real good addition to the table; set up was simple; I think this is a must for this table given most users will probably by laying full size plywood sheets on it; you really need the stability to safely work; I tried a single roller stand initially but it was unreliable and unsteady which is why I bought this table; one gripe is my saw is on a moving platform, the standard leg for the extension table has these rubber feet that drag along the ground as I move the table; when I lower the table the end actually rests on the ground; I don't think it's a major problem though since I can probably replace them with wheels later.",4.0

"This saw could be an All-Star.  Instead, it's a third string bench-sitter.  As least as it came from the factory.

Having read other overwhelmingly positive reviews I ordered the saw.  When it arrived I was careful not to lift it by the arm.  I attached the table to the saw and installed a blade, careful to face the teeth forward and down, per the instructions.

Problem #1.  The blade was rubbing on the side of the blade hole in the table. It took a bit of manipulating the two screws that secure the table to the bevel gauge but I got the blade pretty much centered.  There is no side to side adjustment to account for this.  That's just not acceptable.

Problem #2.  The bevel lock knob on the saw was broken.  That had to have happened during packaging or assembly.  There was no damage to the box upon arrival and the saw was securely packed with the cardboard inserts.

Problem #3.  The blade is tilted because the upper and lower arms aren't in alignment.  WTF?  Seriously.

Problem #4.  The lower guard is bent and doesn't allow the table to tilt to the left.  Not a bid deal to straighten it but it should've never got thru QC like that.

Problem #5.  This one's minor as I didn't expect it to do much anyway.  But the ""blower"" moves about as much air as a flea fart.  it's pretty much useless and is more in the way than functional.

DeWalt gets a premium price for a HarborFreight-quality saw.  You'd think they could make a better product.

Having highlighted the bad, there are some good points.  Very little, if any, vibration regardless of the speed setting.  It's quiet.  Very sturdy and stable.  The speed and blade tension levers are functional and very easy to use.  Changing blades is very easy...it takes about 5 seconds.

So...  I don't want to go thru the brain damage of returning this saw to Amazon.  I'm hoping DeWalt makes this right.  Update will follow.  Email sent to DeWalt re: the problems with this saw.

**UPDATE: 03/14/2017***

I decided to reorder the saw from Amazon.  As usual, no problems with the return/refund.  I received the 2nd saw today and it's perfect.

It's very solid and nothing was broken, scratched, bent, misaligned or otherwise wrong.  This one, too, runs well with little-to-no vibration regardless of the speed setting.  The little blower is still lame but that's not why I bought the saw.

Bottom Line:  I initially rated this saw as 2 Stars.  I've updated that to 4 Stars.  Haven't heard back from DeWalt.  Another issue like this and I'll be a former DeWalt customer and fan.",4.0
Only reason the 4 instead of 5 stars was that while I was waiting the few days it took to get here I found it locally for about $4 cheaper but that was okay since I got what I wanted for a price I was willing to pay (MUCH less that retail) and for less than what most local stores had it....if I had ONLY checked EVERY local store....,4.0
"Was a little concerned when the DW flashlight arrived in a USPS plastic bag (bought from Neandertool). I thought that it was a used item.

I gave 4 stars because I didn't get a ""heads up"" that the item would arrive without the original packaging.",4.0
"First table ordered arrived damaged as noted in other reviews but Amazon customer service was great and they delivered a replacement with next day air and had UPS pick up the damaged item.  The new one took some time to install but it is so nice to have the table, it is far superior to the roller stands I was using.",4.0
"And with a later model saw you don't need the 2x2's (I cut mine then didn't need them, too) or the drill bits and drill (I had it plugged in and the bits pulled & ready).  Wish the instructions had provided tool lists specific for the saw type - maybe it would have entailed another paragraph but would have prevented some annoyance)

Like the earlier reviewer, I cut off the 1/2 inch and then wished I hadn't.  A flush fit to the saw would have made for less risk of hitting the outfeed table with your outflowing wood - I thought I needed to since the table support didn't line up with the support bracket holes - but all you have to do is adjust inward the second table support (there are slotted holes to allow for it) and the brackets mate up nicely.  Now that it's all assembled I wished I had routed the cut edge before putting it all together, but I will go back and hand rout or sand a bevel on it before using it).

As for the reviewer who couldn't get the hinge holes to align, mine didn't either till I turned it over with the pin facing the ceiling (had to really examine the picture with the instructions to tell the pin side went up).

It did fit perfectly in the predrilled and knock-outs and the welded nut bracket for the short-table support were ideal as there is very little clearance inside for that one set of holes.

Hope this helps.. I cannot handle large sheets by myself, so this is really an asset in my shop - 5 Stars for the product itself, 4 overall only due to the instruction shortcomings.",4.0
"I installed the outfeed table on my Unisaw with no issues (the hinge lined up just fine for me).  I also use the table as an outfeed for my planer from the other end (just have to watch when it reaches the cast table lip).

Unfortunately, I follwed the directions and cut 1/2"" off (I don't understand why this was instructed).  If I did it again, I'd leave it full length.

A few minor annoyances: when the table is folded down, it covers the dust port.  Also, there is a large opening in the front of the table for the blade guard which I don't use.",4.0
"I just finished installing the outfeed table and wanted to pass on a few things I came across.  First, I read the other reviews and agree with everything they said.  I called Delta and suggested to them that they also read the reviews and investigated.  They said they would look into it. Right!

I didn't cut off the  inch also.  I asked Delta why they say to do this and the only thing the tech guy said was so saw dust wouldn't get trapped.  I do not see this as a problem, since the entire saw will probably be covered in wood anyway.  I did add a  inch baltic plywood spacer so the horizontal support brackets would line up without bending.

If you have a new saw that has the knock out holes on the backside/bottom (page four paragraph 1) you do not have to make the two 2x2 pieces of wood. It would have been nice to know so I didn't waste a stick of wood.

Page 2 Step 6: Be careful when you stick you hand in the saw for the blade.  It will cut you.

Page 2 Step 7:  When you square the support bars you don't have to been right on just get them as close as you can.  You can level the table later in the installation.

Page 3 Step 9:  The 5/8 carriage bolts are a little short; I had to compress the lock washer then re-install.  Delta don't be so cheap

Page 4 Step 3&4:  The four holes on the hinge and the four holes on the height adjustment bracket DO not line up, no matter how you try.  The adjustment bracket will be offset from the hinge.  This does not effect the final installation.  I asked Delta about this and they just said ""oh"".

Page 4 Fig 11b:  Use a flat washer and lock washer as shown in the picture but doesn't say it in the description.

Page 5:  When you have all the parts assembled make sure that the slots for the miter is aligned before you tighten everything, I didn't notice until I had tighten everything, so I had to undo and redo.

Page 6: Fig 21 and the description letters do not agree, just read carefully.

I give a rating of 4. The table is great but Delta's instructions stinks.",4.0
"I got this table to save me the time of constructing one myself for my 36-715 hybrid.  Unfortunately, I had to modify it enough that I am not sure I saved any time.  Now that it is on, I am pleased with it.  It is probably nicer than what I would have come up with.

To install it, some have complained about reaching the mounting points inside of the saw.  I had no problem reaching both upper mounting points through the throatplate area after removing the blade and splitter.  The lower mounting points were also easily reached through the dust collection opening.

Leveling it is not that bad and does not require two people as it states in the instructions.  Also, they suggest removing the rear rail, which is not really necessary if you use two squares to make your measurements from the table top.

For the hybrid saws, the miter slots will not line up unless you drill new holes for the lower metal support brackets.  The stock openings are rectangular openings for adjusting.  I just partly assembled the support brackets to the outfeed table and lined up the miter slots to mark my new holes.  You will need a couple standard bolts for this also.

The two upper support arms also need to be mounted differently because they would get in the way of both the sliding metal shield around the splitter mount, and also the dust collection port.  I removed the sliding shield and cut a new one without an opening.  So, now I will be shopping for a guard/splitter that does not use the rear mounting point.  With the new shield in place, I then worked out how the support arms would fit.  The only stock measurement I used was the 5 1/4"" distance below the table top for the center of the support arms.  The arms were then attached by drilling the four holes so the arm centers were 11 1/8"" apart.  This makes the outside holes 14"" apart and the inside holes 2 7/8"" from the outside holes (IIRC).  I drilled the same holes in a piece of 1""x3"" maple that spans the width of the cabinet and made room for the bolts holding my shield with a Forstner bit.  Using 3/8"" x 1 1/2"" bolts, washers, lockwashers and nuts;  the arms went on without a hitch and are quite stable.  Just be sure to put the wood plate, nuts and lockwashers on the outside.  I did not use the inside metal mounting plates but did use good sized washers on the inside and I have no clearance problems.  The angled supports will now bolt directly to the lower part of the cabinet without wood spacers and getting the support arms to level was not a problem.

I hope this saves someone some time.  It took me a while to figure out how to get everything to fit, but now that it is on it looks nice and works well.  I am not crazy about the particle board construction, but it is flat so I am not really complaining.  Just be careful with the screw in the table.  Even tightening the bolts can easily damage it.",4.0
"Overall this is a nice product, but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling. You don't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws. Fortunately, I heeded that warning from other reviewers. I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table. Don't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton, and it was packed well. Probably mishandling at the factory. After seeing this and the maximum 1/64"" thickness of the lamination, I plan on banding the sides with hardwood. It won't be long before I add my own dents. I agree with other reviewers. The instructions are horrible.  The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time. Correct them Delta!  It does work and save me space when folded down. The brackets are nice and heavy. I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination.",4.0
I am happy with a Dewalt Scroll Saw DW788 because I already have one. This saw arrived with damage to the box but figured happened in route. Checked contents and nothing appeared to be damaged. I finally was able to assemble and set up and try on 3/7/17. Variable speed adjustment did not work. Otherwise everything else appeared in good working condition. We have done maintenance on other machine so we opened up area where switch is located to see if wire was unhooked and found connector was broken and doesn't snap together and we believe this was a factory defect because it was taped together with some kind of glue/tape like stuff that just peeled off and that is how we found connector was broke! I am taking this machine to be repaired at out local repair facility I would hope someone would reimburse us for this repair. If that has been settled I would mark at 5 star!

Brackets very heavy, this for added stability.  excellent addition, wish I would have purchased it sooner, much better than roller stands.  I like that the unit folds down if the saw needs to be moved.  Rated only 4 stars due to particle board table, but overall good value. Amazon gave excellent service as always.",4.0
"Mine arrived yesterday without incident.  No damage to the table at all but I can see how others have had problems.  Packing was not the best.

The unit is very easy to install - it takes a couple of hours.  I own a late model Unisaw and all the holes are pre-drilled in the cabinet for this table which made the installation very smooth.

Regarding other comments about cutting the table - Either I missed it in the instructions or they took it out, but I didn't see anything that said to cut the table if you're installing it on a newer model.

My only complaint is with the 5/8"" carriage bolts they ship with the unit. In a couple cases, they are barely long enough to get any thread on the nut and fit the pieces together.  It's a very minor thing though and in the end it went together easily.

Fit and finish are good.  I can never understand why Delta uses cheap particle board when there are much better materials available. With care though, it appears that it will last as long as the rest of the tool.",4.0
"Expensive? Yeah. but NOT as costly as cutting off a thumb or a kicked back 2 X 4. This is designed to support whatever you're cutting, so you can SAFELY keep material under control. It is well made (albeit in Taiwan) with heavy- duty parts -  rods, plates and hardware. Mine came with STANDARD 1/2"" SAE nuts. Try using adjustable wrenches to install the rods to the plate and the screws underneath.  Also if you leave just a little looseness in  the installation hardware under your saw, you can easily slide the extension in and out to accomodate your lumber. You may want to lightly lubricate the rods. If I had a complaint, it would be that this should come WITH your DeWalt miter saw instead of as an extra.",4.0

"I've had mine attached to a jet cabinet saw for about a year now. I experienced poor packaging too. Though not severe enough to send it back, one of the corners came buggered up. Mine is particle board....or a very low quality MDF. The sides are skinned with a melamine rather than a laminate.
Ok, that's the bad. This table works, and works well. I wrestled with building my own but in hind site it would be tough to make one as sturdy, light, and with folding capabilities. My shop is in my garage and it's sometimes shared with the car, so having a folding table is nice. The design is very flexible so it should attach to almost any cabinet saw (requires some drilling in your cabinet). It uses lots of angle iron and fastners but the instructions are enough to get you through it. Once installed it makes sheet cutting a breeze. I can't believe I used roller supports for so long. It's expensive for what it is....basically painted angle iron, fastners, and a cheezy table board. But it works great. I would buy it again.",4.0
"This outfeed table is a nice, spacesaving design. However, it conflicts with the dust collection hose when the new style (rear) collector is used. The table will not fold all the way down, but rests on the dust collection hose.

"Really a must have!  Great for both rabbiting and dados up to about 5"" from the edge.  the dust port only works for rabbiting but when used works well.  the device would have received five stars if it didn't make the router so unstable when setting down.  After you make your cut the round dust port causes the router to tip over, once almost rolling off the bench.  This would get a solid five stars if they included stabilizing legs.  I'll have to drill and figure something out.

As for the intended use, it's priceless!  A must have...",4.0

"I purchased this for my wife about a week ago.  I'd originally bought a Porter-Cable and WE were very unhappy with it. I own SEVERAL Dewalt power tools, so I was confident in stepping up in price, knowing that the quality is commensurate.  It would have received 5 stars if it wasn't for the pressure foot issue listed below.

Pro's.
Blade change is relatively easy. Two thumb screws, top and bottom secure the blade in place. Clearance to the lower thumbscrew is good but not superb. The upper arm pivots up so you can position your work piece for inside cuts without having to completely remove the blade. Simply loosen the top thumbscrew for the blad, lift the arm, set your work, lower the arm, tighten your blade and go for it.

Vibration is minimal, even at higher speeds. This is due, in no small part to the cast-iron work surface and the metal construction of the saw itself. All adjustments are easy and well thought out, except for what I listed below, Bevel markings on the gauge are easy to read and the table locks securely at all possible angles. Blade tension adjuster is easy to use and consistently accurate.  The extended handle makes tension adjustments very simple. The power switch is large and easy to get to.  The blower arm stays where you put it!.  It provides enough air to keep your work piece clear, allowing you to easily see your cutting area.

The unit is somewhat heavy, which in this case is a GOOD THING! It provides added stability and speaks to the general quality of the Dewalt line of products.

The ""it would be nice"" category:
The saw only uses plain blades. You cannot use pin blades in this unit.  While that isn't a problem for my wife, some of you might like to have that option. If you must use pin blades, you'll need a different saw.

Having the ability to lift the upper arm is a great benefit. It would be nice if it were engineered to stay in place by itself rather than requiring you to hold it while moving your work piece. Not a real issue, but it is a minor inconvenience.

The scroll saw doesn't generate a lot of sawdust so a dust collection attachment for a shopvac isn't a requirement. However, it 'would be nice' to have that option. I'm sure that some people like to keep their work area completely sawdust free, so for them it would be an added bonus.

Con's
I am disappointed in the pressure foot. While it is large enough, the design is flawed. When you lower the pressure foot on your work piece and tighten the thumb screw, it continues to lower the foot, increasing the pressure on the work piece, making it too tight to move it easily or accurately. If you lift it off a little and then tighten it, there in little to no pressure on the project, even though tightening it does continue to lower it.  Also, the foot is prone to lateral movement. In order to avoid this I have to tighten it so much that my wife can't loosen it and it makes it difficult for me as well. Not practical nor helpful

I've review the light and stand separately.  Low marks on the light!! High marks on the stand.  Given the price of the saw, it would be nice if the stand was included. However, it is DEFINITELY worth the extra cost.",4.0
"Like other reviewers have said, the light is top heavy. The illumination is very good, though. My only real complaint is that the switch is a slider on the front of the unit, a bit inconvenient. A rocker or push-button on the back would be easier to see and use.",4.0
"Very bright and the re-chargeable battery system works great.  Also have and love the companion drill product.
Only thing that isn't great is when trying to use the goose-neck to aim the light with it on the ground; need to wrap it around something.",4.0
"The guide does fit the DWP611 router, counter to what other reviews say. You do have to change the position of the rods from the outside location to the inside location to account for the smaller size of the router. It's sturdy and I like having a vacuum port. The lockdown nuts are solid. The micro adjustment is a bit of an afterthought, the numbers on it are meaningless with no reference Mark or scale. I do think it's still with it for the price I paid.",4.0
needed a replacement.it was sharp and did the job,4.0
"Works great combined with my other 18-volt Dewalt tools, though I did replace the bulb with an LED from Super Brite LEDs, much brighter light and longer battery life, though battery life is pretty long anyway.  Really handy to set or lay it sonw and bend neck around to get the light where you need it.  Would be handy if it was a wider beam though.",4.0
"This flashlight is a very good flaashlight overall.  Its 18v pattery provides long lasting bright light for close objects.  It's ""flexible snake"" handle can be used to hang the light anywhere and aim it where needed. It would be an ideal light to hang under a open car hood to light up the engine compartment.

However, after I received my DeWalt flexible floodhlight, I found on Amazon a black aluminum LED flashlight (""3 Watt Cree LED 3 AA Tactical Flashlight 180 Lumen Long Throwing Tight Spot yet wide moon light Torch, 7224bk"") which uses 3 AA batteries and produces 180-200 lumens of light. A typical flashlight with an incondescant bulb will normally be WELL under 20 lumins, including the DeWalt flexible floodlight. At close objects it has a very small, bright center beam, but a very broad overspill beam allowing the user to view things not in the main beam very well. For illuminating distant objects, the small center beam gets broader with the distance from the object. It will illuminate objects 400-500 ft. away. I purchased the LED flashlight on Amazon and consider it to be one of the best flashlights I've owned. The way that LED flashlights have improved (compared to incondescant bulbs) is amazing. I use 3 re-chargeable AA batteries in mine. They get 3-5 hours per charge. In about 6 months I've only had to recharge it one time, and it gets lots of use. Unlike incondescant bulbs, the LED should VERY rarely, if ever, need to be replaced.",4.0
I've only used this light a few times already... It does stay in place where you want to stay. It's great for working under a cabinet.,4.0

"As a small fellow, I bought this primarily because it was so light.  It is certainly easier to handle.  However, you do have to hold it strongly with both hands.  It develops so much torque and has so little mass to resist, kickback is definitely more of a problem than with my old Sears Craftsman.  I've experienced it climbing up the workpiece and running backwards across it, particularly with a narrow kerf blade like that intended for plywood.
That said, if held securely, it's a very good saw.  The case is roomy and appreciated.  And the handle adjustments are quick and convenient.",4.0
"After owning a cheap craftsman circular saw for 15 years, it was time to upgrade.  I actually tested out about 15 saws and settled on the Milwaukee 6390 for the following reasons:
1.  Power  -  This thing will cut through  it all and it helps with accuracy of the cut.  It also just sounds great  when you fire this thing up. 2.  Weight  -  Light and easy to handle. 3.  Adjustments  -  Easy, quick and accurate.  No effort or tools required  except for blade change, and even that is easy and quick. 4.  Base  -  Large, sturdy and the cut line is quite visible. 5.  Trigger  -  Responsive  and crisp.  On some saws it takes quite a bit of effort to keep power to  the trigger
The downsides: The case is a giant and takes up way too much  space.  The blade that comes with the saw is cheesy.
The bottom line:  Circular saws will last a long time, so spend the bucks on a good one, like  the Milwaukee.  You will be glad you did.  If you buy this saw, you will  find excuses to use it often.",4.0

"Great light for under counter, attic or tough to reach areas.  The gooseneck extension (18"" +) is a real plus.  When battery is in place the light is very stable and not easy to tip over.  I already had batteries and charger, so worklight was an inexpensive addition to my combo set.  I checked at 'box' stores and couldn't find comparable light for near the price I paid for this item on Amazon.  I do handyman/remodeling, and great for inspecting prior to bidding on job.  Not something I use everyday, but when I need the light it is worth every penny spent (and then some).

"I really like this light. I brought this one to replace the first light I have had for a several years.  The first one was out of warranty and the flex broke near the base of the base of the light. It still worked, but you couldn't hold it in position.  Hoping they have improved the design. You can bend this to just about position to get light on something and free both hands to work on it. Uses the standard Dewalt 18v rechargeable batteries. Has a spot in the light to carry a spare blub, it's near the blub, remove the cover like you are going to replace the blub and you will see the small hole to drop a blub in. My first one came if a spare, now they don't. The blub lasts a long time, but if you don't want to be without light drop in a spare just in case. I own three different Dewalt 18v lights and if I need to work and free both hands this is the one I pick off the shelf. I gave it 4 of 5 stars because of the concern it too may break the flex again and need replaced. Amazon's price was great, cheaper to buy the new light than the part to repair the old one.",4.0
"I always thought this thing was kind of a joke. While it is combo filler, it is also very usefull, the flex is rigid and stays where you point it. At least sofar being only 2 weeks old. Bright enough to see, this is not a surefire. I even hung it from some pipes and it worked. I grab this light for more jobs that I ever thought I would.

An multi LED version or better yet a combo LED/incandescent would be a good redesign for the nano version. I don't like the feel of 100% LED lamps.

Anyways, very good lamp but didn't come with extra bulb, hence four stars.",4.0

I think, though, that this is a rather expensive device in its own right before you have to purchase the expensive 18 volt battery that makes it work. (Note, the battery does not come with it!)  If you already have Dewalt or Black and Decker devices that use this battery, however, you're in good shape--especially if you own more than one such battery.",4.0

"The Milwaukee 6390-21 was my first circular saw purchase.  It is fairly lightweight, quiet for a circular saw, zipped right through a bunch of cedar planks and cedar 4x4s once I got the hang of it.

I'm not sure yet whether the adjustable handle is a must-have feature, but it is a nice option to have.  And adjusting the cutting depth and angle is a cinch.

After using this for a full day I think the electric brake and replaceable power cord on the Milwaukee 6394-21 would be a nice upgrade - but perhaps not worth the significant extra cost for my DIY use.  My only other concern is the aluminum base plate, which flexes a bit under pressure.  If Milwaukee had included a stiff magnesium base plate this would be a 5-star saw.  As is, it is still a great bargain - the only other saw I considered (a Makita with magnesium base plate) was $35 more at the local big box store.",4.0

Which would be good for big guys. If you're smaller framed....or a small woman, this might be a little cumbersome. I enjoy using the Porter Cable circular saw much more, without any sacrifice of accuracy or power.

This is a very good saw, but remember to play with your tools before you buy them. And think of the end user if it is a gift.",4.0

"I'm an experienced craftsman, but not a finish woodworker, so when I needed to significantly modify my favorite Oak TV cabinet in our living room to make it fit a new wide-screen TV, I had to temporarily enter into the world of routers and router bits. I had several jobs to do including rounding a four-foot portion of the cabinet edge with a 3/8"" roundover bit.  This edge has a molding sticking up just 1 1/4"" inches away so only a router with a narrow base could do the job. Another constraint was that my 3/8"" roundover bit is 1.26"" in diameter.  Since I had a one-time application for a router (my other router is used as a tool-post grinder on a metal lathe) I opted for the good reviews and inexpensive price of the PC 7310 and an inexpensive set of bits&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yukon-Tool-YTRB24-24-Piece-Router-Bit-Set/dp/B00006F702/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yukon Tool YTRB24 24-Piece Router Bit Set</a>.

My experience?...Very satisfied...but I did some customization.
First, the router worked great with very smooth and powerful operation in all the tasks that I used it for...which may be beyond what it is supposed to be used for.  I was very careful, given my inexperience with routers, and built up temporary support structures and guide fences for most of my uses which included: round a four-foot portion of a solid oak cabinet edge with a 3/8"" roundover bit, flush trim 3/4"" oak plywood with a flushtrim bit, mortis out an exposed plywood edge with a mortising bit, cut out mounting holes for cooling fans using a cooling-fan template and a flushtrim bit, cut off the edge of a 3/4"" solid oak cabinet door and remold it with an ogee bit combined with two other bits, and chamfer the edge of a new 1/4"" Masonite cabinet partition.

Though the router worked great, I had two problems: 1) its base was still too wide to ride on the narrow edge of my cabinet and allow the 3/8"" roundover bit to do its job, and 2) the cutter hole in the bottom of the base of the PC 7310 is too small (1.204"" diameter) to allow installation of my 1.260"" diameter 3/8"" roundover bit. Also, the plastic base provided by PC is not particularly flat, as noted by other reviewers, but that was not critical for my application.  Since the router baseplate is relatively easy to unscrew, I solved all of these issues by fabricating a new aluminum baseplate for the router with a narrow width on one side as needed for my application, and a larger hole as required for my larger cutters...and I made this baseplate flat.

Minor inconveniences: The cutters are a bit difficult to remove after they're tightened, but my Yukon cutters all had a ridge near the shaft so that a screwdriver could be used with a twist to break them free.  Also, I invariably chose to remove the entire base to install and remove the cutters, but that took only seconds.

Bottom Line: the router did a great job for me and was amply powerful to not visibly labor on my significant tasks with oak cabinetry.  My custom modifications solved my particular problems, but these are probably unneeded for the vast majority of the router's intended use.  I highly recommend it.",4.0

"I fix computers for a living.  I took two years of autoshop which makes me the mechanic for the family fleet of vehicles...little did I know, think or imagine that one day I would have to take on the role as a builder/engineer/carpenter.  All of this was thrust upon me about a month ago when my wife decided she wanted to keep chickens in our backyard.  It was my job to somehow assemble a chicken coop for the chickens to live in.

I've got a cordless Ryobi saw that barely holds a charge that got me through some of the construction and I finally told my wife that we needed to invest in something better if this job was ever going to get done.  I read some reviews and decided to buy this saw from the local Home Depot.  I paid $10 more than what it's currently listed here for, but I didn't pay for shipping so it probably evens out.

I have no doubts that this is a quality saw, however; I was a little disappointed that it wasn't actually MADE IN THE USA.  That's somewhat of a bummer.  The Tilt-Loc grip/handle is a neat feature but I haven't had any use for it quite yet.  It's actually a little bit of an effort to get the tilt-loc to move from position to position so I've just got it set at the setting that will fit the darn thing into the box.  Others have mentioned this, but it bears repeating--The saw doesn't fit into the box unless the tilt-loc is in the very bottom position and the saw is set to 0 degrees cut / flat.  It took me probably 5+ minutes to figure out how to get the saw back into the box after I messed with the tilt-loc.  I'm also a little skeptical of the tilt-loc action.  It kind of feels like if you were adjusting that on a regular basis that it's going to let go sooner rather than later and you're going to have a broken handle.  That assumption could be complete wrong but it's just the feeling I get after adjusting it myself.  It's all plastic, it feels nice but it also feels like it's a breaking point.

With that out of the way, the saw is great.  It's been handling all of the tasks that I throw at it with ease.  Again, I'm not a professional carpenter or anything so I can't speak to any shortcomings in the blade that comes with the saw, it works fine for what I've been doing with it.  I've made really nice cuts out 1/2"" plywood, this thing eats through 2x4's like nobodys business...which is what I needed it for.

I really hope and expect to have this saw for quite a long time.  That was the thought of spending the extra money on a good saw at this point in my life rather than buying lesser/cheaper saws and having to replace it down the line.  Though, if you do the math on it, the cheapest saw here on Amazon is around $50 or so, you could pick up 2 of these and still it'd be cheaper than buying one Milwaukee.  Food for thought.",4.0
"I always praise the Milwaukee tools. The tools made in the US that is. The last Milwaukee circular saw I bought was made in China. As I noticed some malfunction in the way it sounded, I disassembled the unit and found out that one of the main bearings was bad. I pulled it out and found out it was a Chinese made bearing. I replaced it with a top brand bearing. I believe Milwaukee should have strict quality control and top quality parts for its tools if they want to maintain the goodwill they enjoy now.",4.0
"This is a very nice, high-quality extension.  It is wider, and has a flat top on the support (opposed to the curved bar on most miter-saw extensions).  In addition, it is longer than the extensions you typically receive with a 10"" miter saw.  The screws to secure it are self-tapping, which is explained in the instructions, so be prepared for that.  I use it with the DW703.  The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is that if you want support on both sides, you need to purchase 2 of the DW7080's.  This gets a bit pricey, considering many saws come with extensions included.  A partial solution to this is to purchase the DW703K, which includes one extension for the same price as the DW703.  Overall, however, the combination of a DeWalt saw and these extensions are well worth the price.",4.0

One thig that I keep seeing in the negitive column in everyones reviews is that it is not precise enough for some people, all I can say is keep in mind what this tool is inted for....this is a laminate trim router...there is nothing precise about that, infact it has always been kind of a joke in the industry that they put the fine adjustment knob on the router at all!  If you are looking for a small precise genral pourpose woodworking router this is not what you want, if you are looking for a laminate trim router as the name implies this is a very good one, we do millons of dollars worth of work each year here and have found for the price this is a fine trim router.",4.0
"I bought this 3/8 inch drill to replace my favorite Hitachi that finally gave up after 20 years. I expect that this Dewalt should last as long. By the way, it is a VSR drill even though that designation is not always evident in the advertising. This Dewalt is solid as a rock and quite powerful for a 3/8 inch drill. The trigger action is smooth and offers full control. I do have two complaints about this drill. First, it is poorly balanced. With it's large chuck and metal housing the weight is shifted way forward and will fatigue you quickly if you are holding it horizontally such as to shoot screws into wallboard for example. Second, the drill should be more compact than it is. If you put in a standard spade bit, the combined length of drill and bit is too long to conveniently drill holes in a 16 inch stud bay.",4.0
"A well made router edge guide but I recommend buying 2 of these to lock down on both sides of a project, sandwiching your work with a fence on both sides helps reduce the drift that I experienced when the router bit dug in. also the bars are not the longest and it does limit the size of stock you can use this with.",4.0
"It is a nice saw.  I wish it came with a light near the table/blade.  When I install a blade it is not in the center of the hole in the plate.  It is touching very lightly the left side.

"I have been using the scroll saw daily since I received it about a month ago.  Even though it's a ""Type 2"", it seems to be working just fine.  I had to tip the table a degree or so to get it to be perpendicular to the blade.  No big deal, I just changed the angle indicator to 0 degrees once the blade was perpendicular to the table.  I thought the price at $455 with free shipping was the best deal around until I found the saw plus table and light for $50 more somewhere else.  Oh well, I'm pretty sure that's one of Murphy's laws.",4.0

"4.5 stars.  I just received this saw to replace an old Milwaukee built like a tank and heavy as one.  This new one is definitely lighter, but feels cheaper, but new saws are like that - they just don't feel the same as my old one.

And made in China, not USA.

The idea of a case was nice until you see the hinges and latches, which are horrible - Milwaukee should have used some good plastic latches rather than flimsy aluminum junk that would seem to rust in a minute.  But that goes to the case, not the saw, which I am sure will be a solid performer.  1/2 star deduction for case.",4.0

"I purchased this splitter to replace the wonderful piece of equipment that came with my Delta Unisaw. Since the stock splitter has been busy collecting dust behind my bench for the last couple years I thought it would be a good idea to replace it with something that works.

It arrived undamaged from Amazon with all the neccessary parts to complete the install. It is very well made and the quick release mechanism works smoothly.

Installation took about 45 minutes, if you have 3 hands or no bones in your fingers you might be able to install it faster. For some reason I had a heck of a time getting the 2 bolts in place - either my fingers are too fat or I'm stupid but it did seem a little tricky. I would recommend putting in the bottom bolt first as the top one has much more wiggle room and is easier to see while you line things up.

I've been using it for a couple weeks now and have been very happy with how easy it is to use. One - it does a great job as a splitter. Since that's what it is I kind of expected that... Two - it's extremely easy to install and remove as you need to. That little feature means I will keep it close by and actually use this safety device.

I only gave it four stars due to the extreme price. It's well made but definitely not 150.00 worth (180.00 for the one I bought since it's for a LT Unisaw - apparently designing one to work with a LT saw cost Biesemeyer considerably more money). They didn't reply to two emails I sent asking about the price so apparently their customer service isn't all that great either.

As another reviewer stated though - how much does it cost to replace a finger? If you can choke down the price you'll be happy with the product.",4.0
"Splitter showed up very quickly (ordered 2-day, got it in less than 24 hours!).  Everything was there, no missing parts, and the splitter plate itself appears to be well made, no blemishes and it's dead flat.

Instructions are pretty simple and clear but as they say, the devil is in the details.  The bracket that the splitter goes into is held in place by two bolts and tightening those bolts while the blade is in place is a bit of a hassle.  You can do it however make sure to have appropriate wrenches and sockets onhand (needs two long 7/16"" sockets and one 1/2"" socket or wrench) and work carefully.

The hardest part for me was getting everything aligned and snugged down.  The splitter needs to be in line with the saw blade and also perpendicular to the tabletop.  You have to leave the bracket bolts pretty loose to be able to move everything around, and then once you've got it all set you will have to clamp everything in place, lower the saw blade and tighten all the bolts (making sure that nothing moves while tightening).  I was able to do it using a straightedge and a square, holding it all down with some double-faced tape and a clamp but it took a while.

If I had to do this all over again, or if I was giving advice to someone, I would say to get a magnetic welding clamp.  This is just two narrow magnets set at right angles, used to hold pipe in position while welding.  You can find them for about six bucks, I wish I'd thought of it beforehand.

Loosen both bracket bolts to allow easy adjustment, raise the saw blade to allow alignment, then stick the magnet to the tabletop and the splitter - this will hold the splitter perpendicular to the table and you can wiggle it around to get it lined up with the saw blade.  It should hold pretty strongly so you can then snug the bracket screws into place once everything is properly set up.

It's actually not critical to get everything lined up with a micrometer since the splitter plate has a tiny bit of play in the bracket.  I think that this is a good thing since it gives you a little room for error.

Once installed, removing the splitter is simple - pop the throat plate, pull the knob and remove the splitter.  To reinsert you just push the splitter into the bracket, it seats and locks with an audible ""snap"".

Works like a charm with my 1/8"" Forrest WW2, however the splitter measures 3/32"" thick so I will test it out with a thin-kerf blade and see if it works.  Perhaps Delta listened to the complaints about the splitter thickness and tweaked it a bit.

Overall a very good, solid product that works as advertised and improves safety.  I'm dinging it a star because of installation hassle but that doesn't seem unusual for many woodworking tools and you only have to do it once.",4.0
"Well, this is a robust and well-made item, however the engineering department failed to take into account that for many of us, thin-kerf blades are the norm. Having to disassemble and grind-down the body of this handsome and somewhat overpriced splitter is a bit disconcerting.
 Installation of this splitter with a Delta Unifence installed is a real hassle. It is obviously intended to partner-up with the Biesemeyer fence instead, which does not have the round rear guide bar to restrict access to the back of ones' saw. Of course, once the installation block is affixed and aligned, it should not require any attention. The quick-disconnect feature works very well, and the splitter reinstalls in perfect alignment each time.",4.0
"I thought it was going to be this one but I have yet to find a saw that I actually could give 5 stars to.

Pros:
The base was square to the blade out of the box. I returned a saw without even plugging it it because the base was out by 3/32"". This one, however, was very close which makes for square speed-square cuts.
Lots of power. I ripped a 12' 2x10 without the saw lugging.
You can easily see the cut line from both sides of the blade.
I like moveable handle, usually it's in its regulay position but occasionally when you don't want to show a lot of blade, it works well.

Cons:
I guess you could count this all as one shortcoming.
Where's the rip guide? I see the spot for it in the box but it is not included for some reason.
Alright, I sucked it up and bought the Milwaukee rip guide for an extra $11. I inserted it into the slot only to find it doesn't fit without grinding off the high spots on the rail of the guide.
The connection for the guide is wanky. The set screw comes in at an angle and doesn't securely hold the position.",4.0

"A six inch random orbital sander is intended for rapidly removing material from large surfaces (eg. table top).  It is not a detail sander and should not be expected to be lightweight and agile.  Use the right tool for the job.  I am very happy with mine.  It does a very good job of quickly sanding large areas.  Unlike the competition (from a certain black/grey company), this sander provides integrated dust collection.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is two fold.  First, the gear mechanism makes a grinding noise (like it is going to break).  My Dewalt biscuit jointer made a similar noise, but has lasted for years.  Second, the variable speed has a very narrow range of speeds (ie. highest speed is really fast, lowest speed is still really fast).",4.0
"I have this installed on my DW708 saw. You really need to buy 2 of these - one for the left side and one for the right. It comes with an extra piece to allow you to attach it to other saws besides the DW708 model but I cannot vouch if this works for other saws. It only comes with a single locking screw. The original packaging from years ago came with 2 screws. They are self tapping screws. If you have 2 extensions installed, you cannot slide them both all the way in - just 50% the way in. Only one can be slid all the way in at a time. The support is 1/4"" lower than the table. I never found this to be a big issue. The support is mainly there to keep things from falling onto the floor - a temporary resting place. I will use my hand or a clamp to hold the wood level to the table when it is time to cut. The locking screws do not have to be locked down tight. You just need them snug enough to keep the extension from wobbling.  The DW7080 works great in conjunction with the DWX723 Heavy-Duty Miter Saw Stand.",4.0

"This has to be be the best power tool I have bought in recent years. I had bought a power planer for quickly reducing thickness of rough cut wood. However the planer is not really suitable for final finishing as it tends to leave deep gouges in the material.. I had a conventional palm sander, but that took too long to achieve results. So taking up the 30-day satisfaction guarantee, and checking out other manufacturers, I opted for the PC 362.
It was absolute charm to setup and use. You change belts by flipping a lever. You adjust the ""trim"" of the belt with a small wheel while the machine is turned on. With 50 grit, it quickly removes 1/16 inch in a couple of passes. So start with 80 and don't apply any pressure - let the tool just glide. Its 15lb and far more sturdy than bosch or dewalt competitors. However the weight is actually a plus, because it means you don't have to force it down to remove material. The dust bag actually works very well at removing the sawdust.
The main consideration was the price. However, don't think you'll get good results if you go for a sub- [$] unit. This is a tool any professional will use again and again.",4.0
"The edge guide was delivered with no issue.  The fence adjusts very easily and comes with two sizes of rods.  The micro adjust feature is extremely useful.

I was able to make a minor adjustment for a perfect fit.  the adjustable fence slides completely closed or opens to fit around the bit is also a nice feature.  The guide was a bit expensive but you get what you pay for.  I would have given 5 stars, but the the locking center nut has to be tightened very carefully.

"Generally, a good saw. Comfortable to pick up and get to work, but not the kind of tool to set down or store carelessly due to the aluminum shoe easily bending.

Saw does get up to speed a bit slow, and it does throw sawdust around. It helps to practice a bit and to use the sharpest, finest blade you can for the work at hand. It's tempting to let the motor do all the work, but stick with good sense and let the proper blade do the work.

I generally enjoy the saw and have a great deal of confidence in it getting the work done. I would give it a higher review, but it's not a tough tool, just a good one.

If it lasts a few years, I'll be happy at this price - although I would have paid extra for a detachable cord and a rip fence to be included in the giant red box...",4.0

Great saw and power.  I was surprised how much I would like the Tilt-Lok and how easy it was to adjust it.  Easy adjustment of the handle, bevel, and cutting depth.  The out-port of the saw dust is nice.

CONS:

It seems to me that it takes a while to get up to full speed.  The blade that comes with it is nothing to brag about.  I wish this saw had the removable cable.  When you put it in the case, like most saws, you put a sharp bend in the cable.  It's has a modest cord grip, but over time this can really wear on the cable.",4.0

I know folks who had taken pride of building their own guides but I took the easy route!! Only reason dropped a star is due to the price, but otherwise it's a well machined product.

"I own the discontinued Dewalt DW703 compound miter saw and only occasionally pull it out of my shed to set up in the garage on a portable workbench when I have a project that needs to be done. Right now I'm working on replacing boards on my deck. I had been moving a second portable workbench and saw horses around to either side of the saw to support the extended lengths of the boards and thought that there must be an easier way to do this. I started pricing these DW7080 Support Extensions online but noticed that many of the stores listed them as ""out of stock"". Since amazon.com had them ""in stock"" I decided to buy two, before they also became discontinued Dewalt items. Amazon is excellent when it comes to shipping their products and I received mine in 2 days. Yes, they are expensive, but so was the miter saw when I bought it. Although these extensions do not slide underneath the saw for storage, for the occasional carpenter like me it won't be a problem to disassemble everything to put away until my next project. I was aware of the comments about the difficulties in inserting the self-tapping T-30 Torx/flathead screw to secure the supports but I had no problems with that after starting the screw with a flathead screwdriver and then tightening it down using a T-30 Torx hex bit inserted in to a  inch socket in to a 3/8 inch adapter attached to my ratchet.

"I want to give this light 5 stars but I can't say it deserves it.  The head on mine never wants to swivel at all.  It feels like if I try and force it, its going to snap clean off so I've stopped trying.  Overall, the light provides pretty good illumination but the top will get warm fairly quickly.  Its been very tough and rugged as it has been dropped repeatedly.  So far nothing has broken or cracked.  The replaceable batteries make it convenient to use.  You can expect to get a good amount of time out of a single battery (depending on the life and condition of your batteries) before having to swap them out.  What would be nice is if they would develop an LED upgrade.  This would make the battery stretch for hours.

I still think it lacks power compared to a worm drive, which isn't all that much more expensive.  Here's what I'd like you to consider before buy a circular saw: try out a worm drive before buying anything. Brakes are a definate plus, for you don't want to slow down when you're on a roll and they make for a downright safer cut.  Also consider the $60 Skil 13amp saw with a laser.  Skil is a great name when it comes to circular saws, and what a great price.  If you want to spend more look at the Skil worm drive saw.

"Other reviewers are correct, this is a terrific little sander with one problem, the switch is tricky to operate.  The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best.  Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task, this should be a no-brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production.  Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent, noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders.  I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable (with no dust collection) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC.  Highly recommended.",4.0
"This is the fifth sander that I own and it is simply great.  The only complaint that I have, as do others, is that the dust collector falls off of the body of the sander - all the time during use!

And that's one of the reasons why it probably gets more use than some of our other sanders.  The vacuum attachment works better with it than on our other sanders.  So far, despite a lightweight appearance that would make you suspicious of its durability, it's still sanding through some rough territory for us.",4.0

"I had no problems using the router guide. I will have to check more strenuously for flex, but this was not noticeable to me while performing some fluting on a piece of walnut.

The only thing which is mildly annoying to me is the dust collection setup. It seems like an obvious thing to have and it works ok when you are trimming or profiling the edge of a board, but when doing operations in the middle of a board (i.e. fluting or cutting a dado) it becomes useless and actually gets in the way. I find that I have to ""prop up"" my work piece on another board that is 2 inches high so that the dust collection port doesnt run into the bottom of my workbench.

"This saw is a huge upgrade from my previous scroll saw.  I've previously used only the cheap (under $100) scroll saw models out there. The blade changing system on this saw is so much quicker and easier to use than previous saws I've tried.  The 20"" work table also is a vast improvement over the smaller models I've been using.  Speed adjustment is simple and easy to do on the fly.  The only feature I don't love about this saw is the workpiece hold-down bar - it's difficult to get tight and slips a bit right to left.  Overall, though, I'm very happy.",4.0
"I got the bundle with the saw, stand and lamp. The stand seems to be sturdy enough, and I do really like the 3-leg design. The instructions weren't great, but I was glad that I had them (lots of parts, though, they do seem to make sense). With the saw on it, it would be pretty easy to tip, if you bumped it from the side or something. Seems totally secure for working at the saw, though. Kind of nice to have such a small footprint, I think. It also included a few extra nuts & bolts & washers, which was nice, because it uses a LOT of them. They should mention that you DEFINITELY need to put the long vertical bolt (for mounting the back of the saw) up into its hole in the back of the stand before securing the nut on the bolt in the top back side of the stand. There's no room to put it in its hole while the nut is attached to that back horizontal bolt. Also, it does tell you, and it's right - definitely don't fully tighten the screws on the stand until after you have mounted the saw.",4.0
Just what I needed.  Don't know why it took me so long to buy one.  Great price and quality product.  My saw takes up a lot less space with it's own stand.,4.0
Great stand! adjustable back leg allows you to tip saw forward for better seeing what you are cutting! Only down side is the stand is somewhat top heavy and easy to tip needs to be bolted to the floor or a board to stabilize it! very comfortable to sit at!,4.0
"This stand is definitely heavy enough to comfortably support the Dewalt Scroll Saw.  However, the assembly instructions don't adequately reflect the actual product or its assembly.  It's not that hard to figure out but its just ridiculous that manufacturers can't get this simple detail right and include decent instructions for their stuff. Also, they could have done a better job with the design, placement of the three bolts at the back end makes it hard to get all three in correctly.  However, you only have to put it together one time, and once it's done it makes a fine platform for Dewalt's excellent scroll saw.",4.0
"Dewalt does need to work on their packaging for this product. They cram all the parts into a box that's about 25% too small for them to fit... so the sides are bulging out and the ends are opened and/or ripped off. But that said, it did arrive at my address with all the parts and without damage. Your mileage may vary.

Assembly was easy enough for me to do by myself. The instructions are very terse (it's just a picture of the completed stand with arrows pointing out where all the bolts go -- no words, steps, or tips -- just a picture). One bolt (the rear top one) interferes with the saw mounting bolt so that was a hassle to get them both on.

Once assembled, the stand isn't exactly rock solid. It's stable enough for the saw but there is a bit of left-to-right wobble in it if you give it enough of a bump. It's not enough wobble to affect the stability of the saw when in operation but I had expected something unquestionably solid from a product like this.

It puts the saw at a very comfortable height. The rear foot adjusts upwards to tilt the saw towards you (if that's your thing) -- but adjustment is not easy once the saw is bolted on. Anyway, overall it fits the bill, I'm happy with it, and I would recommend this stand.",4.0
"This light is, in general, well made. I'm disappointed with two aspects of it: 1) I'm using it on 9096XRP batteries, and the handle design does not balance well with them, (perhaps it's better with the smaller Lithium batteries), and 2) the elevation of the light can be adjusted from horizontal through vertical by rotating the head at the joint where the head joins the handle, but cannot be angled lower than horizontal at all. The first three times I used it as a work light, I had to find something to block up the back of the battery to get the light aimed low enough to light what I was working on. Why a rotating joint to change the elevation of the beam? Beats me. It seems gimmicky, and it reduces the utility of the light compared to a normal friction joint that would have allowed for simply grabbing the head and setting it to the angle I want - including declined angles.

The light beam has plenty of brightness for my purposes, and overall the quality seems good. The grip is the same plastic clamshell that all my other DeWalt tools use, so it's plenty sturdy for a light. I'll endorse it for it's quality, but the engineering leaves me wanting to ask, ""What were you thinking?""",4.0

"I've owned two of these over the years. One was the older model and the one you see here. They are very durable. They will cut anything you want to cut with power to spare. The quick change blade clamp is very simple and  very useful . The orbital action is great for speeding up any cutting job  in anything except metal. Just watch for splinters. The variable speed  makes it much easier to start a cut.  The only complaint I have with the  saw is that it vibrates a whole lot. My hands go numb after only a few  minutes with this saw. If Porter cable would put a counter balance in like  Milwaukee , this would be a 5 star saw.",4.0
"As you have seen by most of the reviews this is a great product.  Milwaukee has incorporated all the power you will ever need and has many great features.  The adjustable handle is very unique, and at all times you can see the cut line without any obstruction.  The height adjustment lever is positioned just right and very easy to use.  The bevel adjustment lever is also very well placed and does not get in the way of the front handle although on my unit it is very tight and hard to move.  I like the fact that if you adjust to cut on a bevel angle the front handle will still be positoned in the level positon and will not intefere with the sight of the cutting line like the Dewalt DW364.  I mention the Dewalt DW364 because I would rate that unit equal in design.  The Milwaukee is much larger and in my estimation unbalanced.  It feels heavier then the weight stated.  Again the Dewalt feels more balanced and lighter even though it comes in at a slightly higher weight.  Also, on a bevel cut the Milwaukee is easy to see the line and the Dewalt almost hides the blade.  It is a toss up between these 2 units but if size, weight and balance are a consideration I would chose the Dewalt.  If features are a factor I would chose the Milwaukee. After saying all that I kept the Milwaukee because they are minor issues to me and this unit outclasses any other unit I have compared it or the Dewalt with.  Also at a price savings over the Dewalt I felt this was a great bargain for a high end company.",4.0

"I received this stand, along with the saw and the light, from another online Tool website for a great price.  The saw is great, the stand is great, and the light is junk.

This stand is a bit tedious to assemble, but the included drawing helped a bit.  The instructions make it very clear they want you to bolt this thing down, but don't worry it.  I suppose someone tipped it over on a dog once, so they added this to the instructions to reduce liability.  It is a tripod, so keep the kids from playing monkey-bar with it and you'll be fine.

The instructions also say to keep the stand bolts a bit loose until you set the saw on it.  I found this to be wise.  It lets the parts all settle in prior to tightening and made for a rock solid platform with no wiggle.

This stand really is a nice comfortable design and, had I purchased it separately for the Amazon price - would have been more than pleased.",4.0
"What can you say about a stand?  It went together easily enough and accomodates my 788 just fine. The legs have a lip on them to allow the stand to be anchored into the floor, however I was not about to ramset a scroll saw into my concrete shop floor. Or, maybe those holes are for wheels, hmmmmm. If you need a stand for your saw, get it.",4.0
"Received the stand in a box that had obviously been opened somewhere before shipping to me. This usually means something is missing. What was missing were instructions of any kind. Nothing in the package showing a picture, assembly, or anything of how it should look. The ONLY clue was the rather obsure picture on the box.

I have heard that DeWalt sends factoy seconds and/or returns to Amazon customers. With defects in both the saw and the lack of instructions with the stand I am beginning to beleive this to be true.

That said, the problem with the saw was taken care of immediately by DeWalt and I was able to figure out how to put the stand together. I guess that makes the cost savings worth the purchases.",4.0

"I recently purchased this extention wing and I am really pleased with its quality and ease of operation and assembly. I read a review on this site and was reluctant to buy it. The person who wrote the review was complaining about how it wouldn't align right with his table. The bolt holes do have a little play for adjustment. When you install it, you should move your fence right in the middle where the two are joined. Pull the lever down to lock the fence. finish tightening the bolts to the wing. When you are through, slide your fence back and fourth to check the alignment. I bought a wing for each side and both bolted up like a charm! I only gave it 4 stars only because I wish the wings were bigger. I feel it was a good deal and it arrived in four days.",4.0

"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the ""Lifter"", which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great.",4.0
"I have had one of these for many years and use it mostly 3/4 pine projects (some red oak and maple also).  It handles the job it was designed for well (home use), if you try to push the machine it just won't handle it well (and you my want a stronger machine for that).  The belt sizes and disc size (along with the 1/3 hp motor) dictates the maximum stock sizes you should try to use with it.  If you want to use it to sharpen tools instead of a grinder, it will do that also.  Just be sure to remove all sawdust before you do, the metal sparks and filings could ignite inside the sander.  The sander is also pretty quiet for its type (at least quieter than the competitors) and also operates smoother.  It would be nice if Delta offered a second table as an inexpensive option.",4.0

"In the last 3 months I've tried 4 different scroll saws, 5 counting this one. All the others were ridiculously difficult to install and change blades. And they all had big holes in the table with a plastic insert with big slots in them making it difficult to make square edged cuts and cutting out small parts. I don't know why they put all those plastic guards around the lower arm.
Now this one is so easy to use compared to the others. The blade clamps are made for plain end blades and its no problem to clamp even one of the smallest sized blades.
 As for doing inside cuts, no problem. One of the other saws I tried had this big clear plastic guard thing over the end of the upper arm and blade clamp. There was no way to get a blade up through a work piece to do inside cuts. With the Dewalt all I have to do is loosen the clamp off of the blade and I can raise the arm a couple inches leaving plenty of room to line a work piece up with the blade then lower the arm and clamp the blade in place. The only thing needed is a small block to hold the arm up while getting the blade through the work piece.
 The blade tension adjustment is also way better than on the other saws I've tried out. It's a little lever right there on the end of the upper arm and you only have to move it about a quarter of a turn to release the tension. Best of all it has markings to line it up with and I can feel it sliding over little notches as I turn it so when I find a tension that works good on a blade I can get the same tension every time I re-clamp the blade when moving it to another inside cut. The main thing you have to remember is you cant lift and carry the saw by the upper arm.
The speed adjustment is easy to use and the saw responds well and keeps a smooth action through its whole speed range. The on/off switch is big and easy to use right on top. One saw I tried it was down under the table another had it half way back on the side of the arm.
About the only complaint I have about it is for the price, it should come with a work light. Even the cheapest poorest quality saw I've tried had a light on it. Almost $500 for it and they want another $30 Bucks for a work light. And it would be nice if they threw in the stand for it too for that price. Its a sweet machine but I think they want a little too much just for their name. That's why I didn't give it the other star.",4.0

I called the service center after tracking its arrival and the person I spoke to explained that the parts were on backorder and would not be available for a week. Ok, so after said ""business week"" I call again to check on the status. The person I now spoke to told me that they were waiting on a 3 amp fuse which they needed to install in order to diagnose the problem. I thought that they determined the ""problem"" after the 1st representative said they were waiting on ""back order"" parts. I inquired why they could not go to the local auto store and purchase said fuse and proceed. I was told that they were not able to do that!!!!  I called Dewalt 800# to speak to a manager and was told that I would have to call the service center again and ask to speak to said manager whom they did not have a name or phone # for!!!????? Now my business is at a standstill, they didn't care, I was told I have to wait at least another week, they didn't care, and I am unable to work due to their lack of SERVICE both for their product and their customers.

"I have just received the DeWalt 788 scroll saw yesterday which was pretty prompt and I was impressed with the efficiency of Amazon.com. The package arrived in a single huge carton box. The delivery guy dropped it off at my front door and I realised then how heavy it was!

The next day, I tried to set up the equipment after reading up the installation guide. Pretty easy I thought, until I discovered that no matter how I placed the material hold-down device, it would not align with the centre of the Saw blade opening. I thought I was suppose to bend the allen key which comes with the package, but decided to check on internet how the pin connecting the material hold-down should look like. It definitely feels like a different pin as compared to the one I was given. Which is actually just an allen key. So I checked out DeWalt website and quickly register my product so I could give them a feedback hoping I could get a pin which looks exactly like the one shown in the diagrams on the manual without having to bend my allen key. There isn't a service site in Singapore and I can't find a spot to give them my feedback. So here I am, writing this .....from a happy customer, I am now sad.

"I had gone through 2 ""cheapie"" scroll saws over the past several years. I do a fair amount of fret work and intarsia. I finally have a machine that holds the blade tightly and is easy to thread into pilot holes.the blower works great. Having the arm tilt is an invaluable feature for me. I am not crazy about the hold down...the arms are too far apart for some of the small work I do. But other than that, a fantastic machine, and getting the stand free is a great incentive. A built in light and blade holder would nice added features.

I just completed cutting and building a very intricate clock that was all fret work with this saw. It's outstanding to operate. Changing the blade and re-tensioning from one hole to the next is fast and easy to do. I like the extra long air hose on the saw; it does a nice job of keeping the work area clear of dust when cutting and it adjusts easily. This saw also runs very smoothly and quite.

"I already owned one DeWalt 788 and because I'm in a semi-production environment, I needed a backup.  Yes, I was please with my first one but still shopped around to see what else was available.  I came back around to ordering a second DeWalt 788 mainly for price - there simply is no better value for the money.  I have only one minor issue with the saw but it's easily overcome.  The issue is that the blade is angled slightly forward (probably intentional) so it cuts aggressively, but it's too aggressive for my delicate-cutting needs.  The issue is easily resolved by altering the lower screw holes and adjusting the blade angle - not something everyone might be comfortable doing but doing that makes it a perfect scroll saw for my needs.  The average user will probably never need to make that adjustment because their needs are different than mine.  Beyond that simple adjustment, I love how well the saw works right out of the box.  Oh, and the first saw is still working just fine even after a year's worth of relatively heavy use.",4.0
"I could not wait to try the saw. There are two things I don't like about it. You can tilt the table to the right, Because of the Thumb screw on the bottom of the blade. You have to change them around in order to get the table to tilt to the right. I don't think someone play with it, they should have got that fix first. When you tighten the table down you have to be careful not to let it get too close to the blade. That's what I didn't like!",4.0
"I bought this saw about 6 years ago. After 6 years on the farm it works just as good as the day I bought it. It has cut many 2x4s and lots of rough lumber. I used it to build 3 building in the farm. The lumber was all rough cut and wet.
The depth adjustment is a lot easier to set that other saws. My only complaint is it is a little heavy to use on a roof. Also I use a smaller saw to cut plywood.",4.0
"I bought this saw because it is one of the few ones which can be adjusted in all 3 angles (cutting depth, bevel, shoe-to-blade alignment). The cutting depth scale was completely off for the blade provided and can be adjusted (no big deal). The bevel calibration to 90 degree cut and the scale were off and needed adjustment before first use. It turned out the bevel adjustment to zero had no room below zero degrees because the shoe was hitting the motor housing already. Shoe-to blade alignment was ok with ~0.2 degrees off. I adjusted it anyway, and it can be done very accurately with this saw.
The weak point of this saw is the shoe: It is as several reviews have stated warped. But he warp is little enough on my saw that it is no issue (1/8 inch on the shoe length). The bigger issue is that it comes unpolished: The plate has been first ground super-rough in direction perpendicular to sawing direction. That means the shoe does not slide at all because you are sanding the wood surface you are cutting. It can easily be fixed by sanding the shoe surface down with sand paper. The shoe also has large burrs from stamping the sheet metal. Since this has been done after grinding there is lots of burr. So you have the rough shoe surface grinding the wood you're cutting and the burrs scratching the wood you're cutting. You have to polish the shoe before use with sand paper, then you'll be fine.
One more thing: This saw is very heavy.
At last: Seems long lasting quality.",4.0
"This review will compare the Milwaukee 0299-20 Magnum and the Dewalt DW235G.  Similar drills from a specification perspective.

I purchased the Milwaukee drill initially due to all the rave online reviews at Amazon and Home Depot.  It seemed like it was well put together.  I bought this specifically to drill holes in railroad ties for rebar pins.  I used it with a Bosch 3/4"" by 9"" daredevil auger bit.

The first few holes went well.  Then the drill started to bog down a lot requiring me to back it out often to clear the debris.  Not a huge deal.  But then the bit bound and the entire chuck assembly snapped and fell off.  There was an alan bolt inside the assembly that sheered completely and the drill was ruined.

I thought maybe I just got a bad drill.  So I took it back to Home Depot (it was cheaper there than Amazon) and they exchanged it after I explained what happened.

I manually freed the bit and started over with the Milwaukee replacement drill.  Drilled the next hole and ran into the same frequent binding.  This time I looked at the chuck assembly and noticed that it was unscrewing itself from the body of the drill.  I stopped immediately before the drill broke and tried to tighten the assembly up manually but it wouldn't move.

So I returned the Milwaukee and opted for the Dewalt DW235G.  It also had good reviews and was very similar from a power perspective.

Brought the Dewalt home and went to work.  Powered through the rest of my railroad ties with no issues.  The bit did get slightly bound up at times, even to the point where I had to uncouple it from the drill and manually back it out of the ties, but the drill never showed any signs of coming apart like the Milwaukee.  It was powerful and did a great job on a tough project.

I did like the side handle better on the Milwaukee, as it had grooves to slot it in to keep it tight.  The Dewalt does not have grooves and the handle did come loose once but for the most part it was fine.

The Milwaukee also seemed to have better variable speed control.  The Dewalt is okay but the trigger was more sensitive and made it ramp up quick if I didn't use an extremely light touch.

The Dewalt felt more solid, worked better for me, and was $40.00 cheaper.  I would recommend the DW235G if you are looking for something in the corded 8 amp category.",4.0
"This is a solid piece of gear.  Sturdy, stout and works well just not enough adjustment to earn five stars.  For example, when you place the light on a flat surface, you cannot angle the light beam in a downward angle without using a shim to tilt the base.  Other than that, it is solid gear but the MSRP is too high for what it delivers.",4.0
Provided ample light for those occasions the lights go out or for general purpose.  I would recommend it to everyone.,4.0
"This is a good product.  It is like ""all other"" edge guides; it must be adjusted and double checked if you are doing precision work.  I would recommend its use with Dewalt routers.",4.0
"I bought this guide for a project where I needed to make some long routes on a screen.  Even with three kids hanging on my legs and not looking at the instructions, I was able to get this thing on in five minutes.  I practiced on one board and felt comfortable enough to take on the project, which was being done for my mom, so I was worried about screwing it up.  But the guide was so easy to use I felt comfortable going after the project right away.

Also, it is as solid as a rock.  However, I've only given it four stars because my use with it has been limited, so I can't give it all five stars just yet.  Still, I don't see anything going wrong as far as durability is concerned.  I recommend this item highly.",4.0
"I'm sure the guide will work as advertized--once I have it.  Ordered it in May, with the website indicating it was in stock and would ship immediately.  It's now been four weeks and the latest email is that it'll be another two to three weeks before it ships--putting delivery into July.

I'm sure this review is a waste of my time because it'll never get posted.",4.0
"I purhcased this a few weeks ago from Amazon. I played around on scrap while getting the hang of it. It is easy to setup and use. I used it making some fluted trim and the vac port worked ok when working near the edge but hooking the shop vac directly to the Dewalt plunge router worked better. All in all well worth the money.

"I received the edge guide a few days ago and used it to complete the mortising for the hanging brackets of my daughter's bed that I recently completed.  I felt that the setup was a snap and it is easy to use.  Prior to using the guide I made a few practice cuts so that I could get a feel for the adjustment and accuracy of the edge guide.  Given how inexpensive this edge guide is, I believe it works great and have no complaints.",4.0
"I wanted a scroll saw to help cut out model airplane parts quickly. I did a lot of reading and settled on this saw and promptly received it a few days later. Bent. It is very heavy and feels sturdy but after running it for a few minutes, I noticed it had a knock at RPM's above speed 4. A quick google search later showed that this was a prominent problem from older models. After inspecting the machine further, I noticed it was cutting at an angle. No problem, just adjust the set screw and the thumb screw until the blade makes a right angle with the table. After maxing out the adjustment, the blade was a solid 1 degree off. On smaller work pieces, this is barely noticeable. Try to cut a circle on 1"" thick wood or stack cut and you will quickly notice that the parts are all different. I took a step back and noticed that the machine's entire top arm was bent about 1/4"" to the right which explained everything. A call to DeWalt support later and they said it will be a month before they can look at it. So, I simply bent the thing back - by hand. If I am able to bend this cast iron by hand, it isn't very strong. Now the knocking is gone and the machine cuts straight vertical cuts.

Now that is worked out...for the performance.

The machine is very quiet, about as loud as a sewing machine. It also vibrates very little.

Blade insertion is very fast and easy. It takes only a few second to thread the blade though a hole and reconnect the blade.

The top arm swings back to give you room to thread the blade and set things up. The bad thing is that it is not spring loaded. The material holder came down on my finger nail by accident because of this. (It slipped out of my hand while trying to thread a blade through a hole) I have to prop the arm up with a block of wood until I can rig up a spring system.

The blade tension is very repeatable and easy to adjust.

It is pretty strong, it didn't slow down once while cutting out 1 1/2"" thick wood.

I recommend waxing the table with finishing wax to make it slippery. Without the wax, materials snagged on the keyhole. I also recommend taping a bag under the bottom arm to catch saw dust. If you are electronically inclined, rig up a small LED near the bottom blade holder. It is hard to see the blade down there because it is dark. I also recommend getting a small lamp and taping another bag to the right side to catch sawdust on the top.

For $500, I would recommend looking at the 16"" excaliber. This saw isn't bad, but it being bent out of the box but a very bad taste in my mouth.",4.0
"I purchased this saw to replace a saw I have been using for over 20 years professionaly. I read reviews on different saws and decided on the DeWalt. After a quick set up I began using it and found that it lived up to the reviews. It has minimal vibration, straight cuts, easy blade change and tensioning and it takes next to no time at all to do pierce cuts. I use this product on site at various flea markets and other special events in SWFL, so here is the bad; after less than 2 weeks of use it quit running, of course it was 5:12 pm on a Friday afternoon. I was able to get through to Dewalt and found that I had an authorized service center about 2 miles away. The saw was dropped off Monday am and finished by Friday afternoon, great turn around time! The motor was defective and replaced. I am again a happy camper and back to making my signs.",4.0
"I am very pleased with my DeWalt DW788 20-inch scroll saw.  It performs as well as I expected. Blade changing is easy.  All controls are readily available.  I have had limited use, but so far everything is OK.",4.0
Well made.  Does bog down a little when cutting thick wood. Also has a little bit of kick-back.  Overall good value.,4.0
"The downside is that it is quite heavy, though that can be a advantage to keeping the saw stable when starting a cut.  The aluminum base seems very rigid and gives confidence on keeping the cut on course.  Nice hard case with space for a few additional blades though you have to be careful stowing the cord to keep it away from the blade.  Hard case is much better than the bags supplied with my other DeWalt purchases.  Warning - no fence is included - you have to buy the over-priced $20 DW3278 fence separately.",4.0
I am normally a Craftsman tool man but lost my last Craftsman Circular Saw to a shop fire.  This is my first DeWalt Circular Saw and I am impressed.  It has everything my Craftsman had except a lazer guide.  It is considerably lighter than my Craftsman.  It also has an extra long cord which helps me.  I recommend this DeWalt Circular Saw to anyone needing a good dependable saw and will probably be buying more DeWalt products in the near future.  JJF,4.0
"I installed these blades as replacements on my Delta 22-540 planer and was very pleased with how sharp they were and how easy it was to install them.  Once installed these knives have done a great job for me on red oak, q/s white oak, pine, and poplar.

I have owned this planer for years now and I find that these double edged knives are a great value.  By flipping them over when they get dull they last me a long time.",4.0
"I used one side of the blades to plane pine wood.  The boards were 4 in.  wide, about 1/2 inch thick and approx. 6 ft long.  I planes them down to  about 3/8 in.  I did about 8 pieces.  All  went well but one board had many  knots in it and it chipped the blade.  Seems great for wood with few knots  in it.",4.0
"The DeWalt DW908 18-volt flashlight is a nice piece of equipment and great to have around the garage.  Purchased it because I have five or six other DeWalt 18v tools and a couple batteries, and they are all outstanding quality.

The light delivered to me has the smaller footprint (for lithium batteries), though my toolset still is based on NiCd batteries and chargers. That was not a problem as it still fits nicely on the NiCd battery... matter of fact, I think that the bigger NiCd battery probably gives this light a much more stable base than a smaller battery would.  Does make it a bit heavy to carry around though, so this light stays in the shop and does not hit the trail with us.

The light works well and the position selector for the rotating head makes it easier for me to get the light to shine on just the right place that I need it to.  Similar to comments in other reviews, I was a bit surprised by the lack of intensity of the light though -- it might be just a tad brighter than your typical 2-D cell non-LCD flashlight.  Maybe I have become spoiled by all of the CREE LCDs flooding the market these days, but I did expect a brighter, whiter light.

On the flip side, this light's reflection will not blind you when under the car working. It puts out just the amount of light needed, and the swivel head helps direct things nicely. Looks like some reviewers got the spare bulbs with theirs, and some did not... we were on the 'did not' side of things, but that is OK. Already have a couple spares order and sitting in my shopping cart waiting for me to checkout.

If you are looking for a good, sturdy flashlight head to run on your Dewalt 18v batteries, this one will work. It is not the brightest or the lightest on the market, but the price and utility are right. If, like us, that is what you seek - then I recommend this light to you.

UPDATE 08/07/14: Based on feedback from another user, I purchased an LED-based replacement head for this light... and it made a huge difference in output. While the beam is still tight (still somewhat spotlight'ish), the bright white output is excellent. Give it a try if you are looking for that type of boost (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DEWALT-DCL0900-Replacement-LED-Bulb/dp/B0075IHV7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DEWALT DCL0900 Replacement LED Bulb</a>

"I use this drill to run my grain mill for homebrewing. As others have mentioned its a robust drill and has torque enough to keep the mill moving through 30 lbs of grain.

Other than that, I've had the drill for a year and it is dependable!",4.0
This drill is much better than a cordless drill. It has the power to really drill into metal\wood with no loss of power. Even though it is a corded drill it has the guts to do heavy drilling without loss of power like a cordless drill. Make sure you buy the 1\2 inch not the 3\8's drill for real power.,4.0
"Not all drills are designed the same.  I wanted a 1/2"" drive, VSR with a relatively low top RPM but with plenty of power.  I also wanted it at a reasonable price but with construction quality that would cause it to last for years under routine use by an intense DIY'er, me. The detailed list of specifications on the Amazon site allowed me to pick exactly what I wanted and I ended up paying $15. less than the sale price in any of the big-box stores. It arrived in 2 days and I put it right to work using a
4-1/2"" hole saw through a double layer of 5/8"" plywood.  Trust me, use the auxillary handle and hold on tight this brute has got the power I was looking for.  The VSR trigger provides very good speed control and the overall construction of the drill is impressive.  I got exactly the drill I wanted and more quality than I anticipated for the price.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the chuck key does not engage the chuck as positively as I would like but, with enough pressure you can tighten the chuck as tight as required.

"I have an older Craftsman Scroll Saw and wanted to upgrade to a newer unit. I purchased the Dewalt and have been pleased with the performance.  Large table top, low vibration and proper blade alignment is key to getting good results especially when cutting thin materials, such as fret work.  This saw does a good job at a fairly affordable price.  Blade changes are quick and accessible vs my older machine.  Variable speed control is also easily accessible. I also like the adjustable air stream to keep the dust and debris out of the cutting line. I would also recommend a foot control switch to provide power to the saw. (It does not come with the saw.)  I installed a sewing machine foot switch so I can use both hands to quicking adjust the material I'm cutting w/o having to switch the machine off by hand. Especially handy with sharp blades when changing cutting directions.",4.0
This is a very good drill which I bought to replace another 1/2-inch drill which kept overheating after a short period of use preventing me from finishing jobs.  The rpm on this drill is somewhat slower but it definitely provides plenty of needed power.  Not sure how it would work out in the workplace on an everyday basis but for my occasional needs it works just fine.,4.0
"I've owned this circular saw for over a year now.  It is heavy.  I think most of the people who complained about the saw kicking tried to hold it with one hand.  It has not kicked on me once when held correctly.  Unless you bench 250, you want to use both handles all the time.  Did I mention that the saw is heavy?  Also, it is unlikely that the blade is bent.  The blade never touches the ground because of the blade guard.  When you are sawing, you can look down and see if the blade wobbles.  The electric brake is not a safety feature.  When you release the trigger, the blade still spins for 2-3 seconds.  According to the instructions, the electronic brake is meant for certain precise cuts where you want to stop the blade from spinning without removing the saw from the cut.  In retrospect, I think maybe a lighter circular saw without the electronic brake feature would have been a better buy.",4.0

"when I received the saw, it was missing the material hold down foot and the arm that holds it to the saw.  I called Dewalt and they sent both parts in a few days.  It was at this point that I realized that they did not send the hardware to bolt the parts to the saw.  After another call to Dewalt, I now have all the parts that the saw should have came with.  I have only used the saw a few times but it operates well and has good features. I hope that over the long term that the manufacturing quality turns out to be better that the quality control people that failed to see that the saw was missing parts before it was shipped. Over all I would still recommend the purchase of this item, but I would suggest that you inspect the saw upon receiving it to ensure that all the parts are there.  Also if you need parts, make sure you ask for the hardware to install them and not expect that Dewalt will send you every thing you need without asking for every little item.",4.0

"I've used a number of these lights in the past and they all broke after dropping a couple times.  Which in theory, would be my fault, but with Dewalt, and this being a work light, it shouldn't.

"I bought this saw over 10 years ago, as soon as DeWalt released it. At the time it was the gold standard of sidewinders and in many ways it still is. I love the adjustability: super fast and accurate depth adjustment (the front knob and rear pivot is brilliant DeWalt!), fast, smooth and accurate angle adjustment. While the base was an improvement over most saws of it's time, it has been surpassed by cast bases such as Bosch's, and I'd like to see DeWalt put a better base on this saw. Mine has not stayed flat. If they did that, and perhaps boosted the amperage a bit, it would be as perfect as a sidewinder gets.

"I researched a tested a number of circular saws before eventually choosing the DW364. I use the circular saw for light framing work, finish carpentry, and cabinet-making and I wanted a good, jack-of-all-trades tools that would be appropriate for the variety of projects I would use it for. After looking at comparable saws from Bosch, Makita, Hitachi, Porter-Cable, and Milwaukee, I short-listed the workhorse Makita 5007 and the DeWalt as the two that I would like to own. Initially, Makita's no-nonsense, field-proven design and reputation for reliability were winning me over, but I took a chance on the superior ergonomics and features of the DeWalt and didn't look back.

There are two really standout features of this saw; the first is the precise and heavy-duty depth adjustment. Why don't other tool-makers build their saws this way? The stamped the sheetmetal rail and thumb-knob found on other saws is adequate at best, and unstable at worst. One of my 'tests' involved setting the depth gauge to it's shallowest setting, putting the saw on the floor, and leaning in to the handle with all my (220 lb) weight. Only the Makita and the DeWalt didn't deflect under this abuse, but the elegance of the DeWalt's design and the fact that the rear-pivot design keeps the attitude of the handle in roughly the same place, regardless of the depth setting, gave it a leg-up over the Makita.

The second standout feature is the large and rigid hard-anodized aluminum shoe. The DeWalt's shoe appears to be about 30-percent bigger than those found on comparable saws and, unlike the Makita's die-cut aluminum shoe, the edges are machined smooth. Does this really affect the day-to-day performance of the saw? Probably not, but it is a nice detail. The DeWalt's shoe also appears to virtually scratch- and gouge-proof. I've seen my share of field-worn Makita 5007s to know that the their shoes are susceptible to gouging with use and abuse. For a framing saw, this is non-issue, but I'd hate for my saw to accumulate nicks and gouges that might scar the surface of finish cabinetry materials. Again, it is a nice detail that helps the DeWalt stand out from the rest. I tend to prefer cast shoes or even the stamped-steel ones found on many worm-drive saws but, as stamped aluminum ones go, this is the best.

No saw is perfect, and this one has its faults. The chassis doesn't seem quite as sturdy or well put together as that of the Makita, but it is certainly comparable to those of the Bosch, Porter-Cable, and Milwaukee saws I looked at, and this saw is big and heavy for a sidewinder. But is seems to tackle anything you through at is with flying colors. Using the included 24-tooth framing blade it powers through wet 4X4s like a worm-drive; throw on a 40-tooth, thin-kerf Freud Diablo and you can precisely rip sheets of delicate 1/4"" Baltic birch plywood with aplomb.

This is probably the closest thing to the perfect circular saw you'll find. It has fulfulled all of my original purchase objectives and every time I use it, I am impressed with what a great design it is and how well it just works. If you only have room for one saw in your tool cabinet, I can't see how you'd go wrong with the DW364.",4.0
Very happy with the price and delivery was quick. These are factory blades so I expect them to work as such.,4.0
"Well, I have yet to buy a DeWalt tool that I haven't been happy with, and this saw is no exception.  This saw makes consistent cuts and has a ton of great features.  I would make two suggestions when buying it that some people may overlook:
First, I would buy a quality blade for use with your intended projects rather than the one included (it cuts, but as with most blades included with saws, probably isn't going to satisfy your needs)
Second, I would strongly suggest picking up the optional rip fence (DW3278).  You can usually find it up for around $10.00, and it makes long straight cuts infinitely easier.  Definitely a good investment!
Nevertheless, I am extremely happy with this saw.  THe only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the included accessories (and lack of an included rip fence).",4.0
"I picked up this saw/kit about 6 months ago and have used it inside and out up here in Maine.  While I like the inside weather, it never cared how think the ice was on the lumber.  I am a bit biased toward yellow tools anyway but I am really satisifed with this saw.  A few notes though that keep me from giving it a perfect score.  It arrived mis-adjusted, and it took some time to get it right.  But that is also an advantage.  To have a saw with a built in tracking adjustment is well worth it to be able to true up your saw blade with the base plate.  Unfortunately, I can no longer use the pre-stamped cutting marks as I had to move it quite a bit to get things square.  Secondly, the guard spring is way too tense.  I build a lot of stairs and any cut that is more than a few degrees off of 90 to the wood, the tight guard spring will pull the saw off line.  Since the saw is hefty, this really makes your wrist tire after a cutting a few ten step stringers.  I'm going to take mine apart and loosen up that spring it is really way too tight.  The weight does get to you after a few days of swinging it around and fighting that guard tension but I'm telling ya this thing cuts like wood like butter.  By the way, do the right thing and break in the brushes like it says - otherwise the blade break will not work properly.",4.0

To give you an estimate of how long they last. I ran approximately 20 boards (approx 20""- 40"" long) of varying thickness through my planer. All were hard wood. After about the fifth board I started to notice some very minor grooving. Now the grooves are bigger and it is getting time to change them. However they are still in the range that a quick sanding will remove the grooves. So they do ok up against a hard wood. But will not last forever. Dual sided makes these well worth it.",4.0

The li-ion battery's seem to hold a charge for a very long time. This is a very bright light. It now lays in wait for the next blackout.

"I ordered this scroll saw packaged with the stand over a month ago in order to take advantage of getting both the saw and stand at a reduced price.  Although the saw arrived in perfect working condition, the stand was missing approximately 50 percent of its parts.  I immediately called Amazon and they were to ship another stand to me.  When I received the new stand it was missing approximately 75% of its parts.  I couldn't believe it -- two out of two times they couldn't deliver the goods!

When I called Amazon customer service they blamed the shipping center and said they would get back to me within 24 hours with a solution.  The next day I got an e-mail telling me to return the stand and that they would credit my account.  They made no offer to send me a complete stand or to find out what was happening in their shipping center.  That only left me with the alternative to go online to another store to purchase the stand at an extra cost of $40 to me.

If that wasn't enough, the Amazon customer service department sent me return shipping labels, or so I thought that was what they were, and told me to contact UPS for the return.  Our UPS guy did not recognize the labels, in fact there was no mention of UPS or Federal Express on the label at all, only a bar code.  I later found out that the customer service person had misspoken and I had to send the items back through the post office.  They also sent me new labels.

This is the last time I will purchase an item like this from Amazon.  Obviously they don't have problems delivering books and DVDs but lack the ability to deliver more complicated items.

What really disappoints me is the Amazon's customer service department.  You, the customer mean nothing to them.  They were unwilling to talk about any compensation to me regarding the fact that I had to go elsewhere to purchase the same item for more money.  Of course the people your are talking with can absolutely do nothing.  How can they call it customer service?",4.0

The DeWalt would earn 5 stars from me, but for the following:  the light tends to ""droop"" of it own weight (this can be frustrating at first, but ends up not being a big deal); the blower is anaemic (but so are others I've tried); and the warranty is only 1 year (Dremel is 2); the price is a bit ""pricey""--but the product is definitely better than the less expensive machines.

"Tired of picking up flashlights that are on their last battery legs, right when you need them?  Always keep a spare battery charged for this or other DeWalt 18v products and you won't worry when the electricity goes off or you need a light in a dark space to do your work.",4.0

Both take the same bulb, and these DeWalt xenon bulbs are bright and hold up pretty well to shock and vibration (I've dropped both lights more than once and the bulbs -- as well as both of the flashlights -- can take a reasonably good beating).  But recently I've found the same bulb (looks like same manufacturer, too) branded under the Craftsman name at both Sears and OSH (for those of you in California) selling for $1.49 each.

"Over all this is a GREAT saw. My only issue with it is the table on my saw has a high spot in it right where the blade passes threw the table. Makes it IMPOSSABLE to cut 90 degree angle's. And the powder coat on the lower arm was chipping off right out of the box, there was yellow paint chips all over the inside of my box. I just received my saw this weekend, (4-15-2006) So I have only had it for about 3 days now. The paint chips, not a big deal, the table not being perfectly flat, IS A BIG DEAL! Especialy when you pay what you do for this saw! The blade change system on it is great, especialy if you do a lot of Fretwork and have to constantly feed the blade threw hole's to do inside cutting. You just release the tension on the blade, turn the thumb screw and Walla! Blade is free. The upper arm moves up out of the way while fishing the blade threw the hole, I use a scrape block of wood I have in between the table and upper arm to hold it up out of the way. Would of been nice if they would of designed it with a spring or something to do that for you but O well, what do you do? Blade tension and speed control are right up front and easy to get to while cutting, although the on/off switch seems a little flimsy, but thats an easy fix buy getting a footswitch, that way you don't have to keep looking for the on/off switch while cutting, just take your foot off the switch and the saw stop's! The size of the table is great, nice and big(just not flat in my case) plenty of room for larger projects. And the 20inch's of depth on the throat is a plus also. Other saw's in this price range only give you a 16 to 18inch clearance. It could use a more powerfull motor and a dust collection system that would allow you to hook up to a shop vac or something. All in all its a great saw, but DeWalt, I don't know what you guys are doing over there but maybe you need to sit back and rethink some things! A saw of this quality should not be shipped with a sub par table! Is it really that hard to make sure a table has a nice level surface on it? Obviously the surface is machined down, you can tell by the machining marks left on the surface of the table. So how does it develope a high spot? Hopefully DeWalt will correct this issue and continue making great quality tool's.",4.0

"Our sidekick has received much use and abuse and continues to work like a dream.  We've used it as a framing saw on three large and countless smaller projects and for hundreds of compound miter cuts on hardwood.  The saw still cuts square as the day it was new.  The stand is a little flexy, but is fine for all but long, very heavy lumber.  With an additional work stand, cutting long 4x6 treated posts is easy to do alone.  I really shopped long and hard before buying and was worried about if this was the right tool, but it has proven itself worthy and a good value.",4.0
"I had recently been looking for a miter saw and compared various models. I finalized my choice based on Delta's reputation for producing good quality product. Secondly, I found the added stand a great deal based on cost. In finally getting down to using the Sidekick, I found it easy to use, with angle adjustments quite easy to use. With an 80 tooth blade this saw can certainly get detail work done with ease and precision. The stand, Hmm, the stand needs better locking mechanisms, so the legs cannot fold in on itself if accidently bumped. Overall, great saw, with a stand that needs more attention to detail.",4.0
"What an advantage a sliding miter is over my old fixed miter saw.  I bought this saw from amazon a couple of months ago to build a deck.  I knew I would like it because earlier in the summer I had helped my in-laws with some house framing and they had one.  If not for that experience, I probably would have shied away due to some previous reviews with warnings about cracked handles.  My saw did not and does not have a cracked handle. I think it might be easy to break the handle if you picked the entire saw up by it- which the instructions clearly tell you not to do.
My deck is now 99% finished, and I cut nearly every board on some type of bevel or miter with this saw - 26,000 pounds of lumber according to the delivery sheet.  I cut hundreds of 2x8 beams and joists, 4x4 posts and 5/4x6 Trex decking. It has lots of power, cuts smoothly and cleanly - no problems.  I say the saw is a good value because it is cheaper than most of the competition, and has the added value of the stand - which costs about $100-150 more for every other saw I looked at.  My only complaints are minor.  first, the miter stops are not quite as easy to feel as I would like - you can't set it without looking.  Second, sawdust tends to blow right on the miter markings, causing you to dust them off every time you need to reset(the dust bag has about as much value as every other one I own, which is zero - why do they bother putting them on?).",4.0
Fast shipping and they were easy to install.,4.0

"The Dewalt DW788 is my first scroll saw. Haven't even used someone else's before. So I would really like to thank everyone who took the time to write a review on it and the other scroll saws at amazon. It was the primary reason I chose the Dewalt.

I make boxe's, all kinds, shapes and size's. I have pretty much quit using metal fastener's, hinges, knobs, catch's, etc. I really enjoy making my own out of wood. Have been using a multitude of power and hand tools to make my own, but thought a scroll saw would allow me to make even smaller, more intricate pieces.

Assembly was very quick and easy. I added rubber feet to the base of the saw as it will sit on a workbench not on its own stand. Have a small shop, every thing has to be mobile. I also purchased a foot switch as everyone I talked with about scroll saws seems to feel it is a necessary safety feature. With a combination of the rubber feet and a rubber pad, the machine doesn't move at all, even on speed 8. Vibration is very minimal, and luckily the saw is at the perfect heighth when sitting on the bench. The dust blower works adequately, but I am going to rig a vacuum source up somehow. Changing blades is a bit of a challenge at first, but I think with time and practice it will become much easier. I also have rigged a swing arm lamp to use with the saw, old tired eyes ya know, need all the help I can get.

I mostly use hardwoods, and thickness's up to 1"" so blade selection and speed are going to be critical items. So far I probably have spent 10-15 hours just practicing, using differant woods, blades, speeds, feed rate, etc., and taking a few notes to help later on. I am very happy with the results so far. Have made two sets of decorative hinges out of mesquite and am very pleased with the small kerf I was able to achieve and how well they fit and function. They took a bit of time to produce, but I know that will change as I become more practiced and comfortable with the machine's ability and of course my own.

I spent a lot of time researching scroll saw's before purchasing the Dewalt. It will not be used everyday, but hopefully will be used a lot for a long time. So I wanted a machine that would last a long time and I believe the Dewalt will do the job for me.

Recommend it highly.",4.0

"This is one fine saw its like driving a BMW  compared to a VW bug on bad roads. The only 2 problems I have had are the lower blade chuck and the on off switch. If you buy one and live aways from the repair shop be sure to get an extra on off switch it takes just a few minutes to put one in. Its a good idea to get an extre blade chuck both are the same part number. Keep the table clean and waxed and be sure to clean up the ends if the blades with sand paper also buff the table top with 300+ grite sandpaper befor waxing. The work piece hold down does make a fine hat holder,better than throwing it away. Have fun and enjoy spending the money you have saved.

"The DeWalt DW908 18-volt flashlight accepts DeWalt 18V batteries, either NiCd or Lithium ion. If you use DeWalt 18V cordless power tools and have 2 or more DeWalt 18V rechargable batteries, then this is a useful flashlight. Of course, it works like any rechargable flashlight and its pretty bright as you would expect for an 18V flashlight. The value of it is in helping manage battery life of the 18 volt Ni-Cd batteries - you can use the flashlight to FULLY discharge the battery before recharging, thus getting some use out of a battery that might be too weak to run your saw, but that can light up your flashlight for awhile. This helps prolong the life of the NiCd batteries. The flashlight has a swivel head and stores a spare bulb.

"Prior to owning this sander, I had a Porter Cable 333.  When it died on me (earlier than I thought it should have) I tried this Dewalt and found it to be better than the PC.  The one thing I have noticed is that if you're ever using it on an edge to round it, the pad will get ""dented"".  This could have been because I used it in a manner that it wasn't made for but who doesn't?  Overall, I think it's a great little sander and would buy it over the Porter Cable again in the future.",4.0
"This sander really does work fine, it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though, I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum, but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover, that I usually fail to properly toggle, so when I start to sand, it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however, that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it, dropped it, loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders, but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over.",4.0

"definitely a *major* improvement over not having one.
I remember having a bit of a problem getting the screw holes in the hood to line up with those in the planer, but no hig hammers or powertools were required to overcome this minor hassle.
The silliness is that you can't flip up the outfeed with the  hood mounted, and unmounting the hood each time isn't rational.  My planer is mounted under a workbench, and I just left plenty of clear and in the back.
I'd say this ought to be bundled with the planer - which is a  great planer by the way - this tool produces *volumes* of chips!  some form of dust or chip collection is a requirement, packaging it separately is just a form of gouging.
I've never noticed any chip compression pitting as described by another reviewer - either with or without the hood.  btw. I'm using a 5.5hp Sears shop vacuum with it.",4.0
This dust hood works fairly well but I still get chips around the planer knives...leaving dents in the surface of the boards even when using a 2hp dust collector connected using less than 10 feet of hose.  The hood also  prevents you from folding up the out feed table which is a bit of an hassle  for storing the tool when not in use.,4.0

The bit would not fit the hole in the stock base plate. I (and a lot of others) couldn't believe Porter-Cable would make their classic router without the capability to accept any non-pro grade bit. I had two different sized collets so why not two base plates?

"As a novice at routing, I was puzzled for a while when I bought router bits that would not fit through the hole in the router base. Lo and behold, after reading an Amazon review I learned that you could buy an optional sub-base with a larger whole that would accommodate larger bits. I needed to round the edge of a 1"" piece of oak, and the rounding bit has a ""shoulder"" that needed to be above the work surface. So the larger hole in the sub-base enabled me to raise the bit so that only the curved portion engaged the wood. Evidently the thinking behind the smaller hole is to make the router more stable for hand-held use, but I found it no problem to work with the larger hole. I totally agree with whoever said that this base should come standard with the router - with as much as router tables cost, you need this flexibility to maximize what you can do in the hand-held mode.",4.0
"Yeah, it does what it should.  Gives you a wider hole for large bits, and lets you see your work unlike the stock black base.  It seems equally slick and glides over the surface well.

"Using Delta mobile base for an older Delta compound slide power miter with integral stand. It works fine. The steel corner brackets are sturdy heavy gauge fabrication. I machined the hardwood rails to fit the brackets snug with no gaps, does not flex in use.
One significant complaint is that the product included carriage bolts for connecting the steel brackets to the wood that were too short to fully thread the nuts! Reduced rating one star because of this spec. error. I purchased next size longer carriage bolts locally. The additional length also provided space to add split ring lock washers, so the connections are less likely to come loose. Similarly, the leveler legs should be next size longer. The short length does not allow for much height adjustment, but not an issue if work area floor is smooth and level.",4.0

Now that said, I bought a similar set at Harbor Freight for about $5 less and it's a little different - instead of the flip up/down thing to make it mobile, this one is on four casters and rolls around until/unless you lock it down with two screw sets; I put my band saw on this one.  I would say either is fine, but I would give a small margin to the less expensive one from Harbor Freight, but it's a close call.",4.0
instructions could be a little clearer concerning wheel holes.,4.0
"I have a similar stand from Delta under my band saw, so I knew this was going to be a great to operate, which it is. I'm using this one to move my jointer around and I do not regret the purchase. The reason I'm giving it only four stars is for the following two reasons. First, some of the hex nuts worked with my 1/2"" wrench while others were just a bit too large. I figured it was just poor quality from the manufacturer, but finally realized that some of the nuts were 13mm. I don't think that was intended, and was probably just a mix-up by the manufacturer.  Secondly, it would have been helpful if the instructions stated a minimum size for the base. I initially cut the wood for a 14 1/2"" base to fit the 14"" base of my router, but it turns out that it will accept only a minimum width of 15 1/4"" so that the foot operated wheel can fit. It would have been good to know that before cutting all the wood. Apart from the one-time assembly issues, it works really well. My main reason for choosing this one is that it does not contain any plastic parts that some of the other mobile bases contain.",4.0
"This part is not really worth it.  I was using a Bosch orbital jigsaw that that I got for our pergo kitchen floor.  I started out using the inserts, but after a while I just couldn't see the line I needed to cut so I took it off.  When I did I really didn't notice a difference with it off.  If you use a sharp fine tooth blade you can achieve the same results and see where you are trying to cut. In my opinion this is just alot of fluff.  Invest in a bunch of good blades, its worth it.",4.0
"I thought that since they were clear plastic, they would do the job, and not get in the way of being able to see the line. Wrong! They fog up with wood dust on the underside, right away, and the line is impossible to see. When I wanted to see where my marks were at the end of the cut, I had to guess.
  In terms of getting a straight aim, Bosch put a V groove on the leading edge. If you were making a completely through cut, then the splintering inserts are a good thing to have. But when I tried to see where my cut would stop, it was buried under the insert, and couldn't see my mark. So I guessed. The net result is an inaccurate cut. When I took the insert off, I could make the cut, and come to an exact mark.
  The insert blocks the blower from being able to get to the wood, so it is only cleaning off the top. Having used it both ways, it is nowhere near as good as eyeballing the blade.
  I know they are inexpensive, so I shouldn't get so excited. The reason why I feel bad is that one came with the jigsaw, and instead of using it, I went ahead and bought a five pack of them.
  I used a finer tooth blade, made my cuts into 3/4"" oak with the splintering inserts installed. It made a very smooth cut without splintering. I removed the inserts, and used the same finer tooth blade, made my cuts, and it also made a very smooth cut without splintering.
  End of story, just use a good finer tooth blade. The Bosch blades are Swiss made, and they are so sharp they are almost scary. They fly through the material, and don't create any splinters, just clean smooth edges.
  My advice, put the money toward a new pack of fine tooth blades.",4.0
"I prefer reverse tooth or fine blades when I don't want splinters. That  way I can keep a close eye on the cut which is harder with these. If you  are using a straight edge I suppose they would be more useful. For a truly  clean cut I make a rough cut about 1/8"" larger and then use a router  and a straight edge for the final clean up. I would spend my money on good  blades rather than these.",4.0

Think of the money you save right there.  Many people complain that there is no cd player.  This is fine with me  because I would worry about dust on the lense or a jarring impact would ruin it. Also the dust/dirt would get on my cds and scratch them.
One final note: this radio is loud and the sound carries far and clean. I can hear this radio from at least 100 yds.",4.0
"This is a great radio and charger.  Sound is good for such a tough box.  I have ruined many radios over the years, yet I hope to have this one for awhile.  It charges my batteries or runs on them, which I like alot.  The reception is good in my area and I can adjust the station or the volume without taking off my gloves (the digital tuner on the Milwalkie unit requires you to remove your gloves to make adjustments).  I also use the auxillary jack to plug my MP3 player into and enjoy many hours of commercial free tunes.  My only complaint is that the battery does not charge if the unit is plugged in but turned off.  To get around this I switch the dial to ""aux"" instead of 'off""  Overall a very nice unit.",4.0
"Too many times over I here folks complaining that DeWalt should have come out with a CD Charger or that this particular unit has a tough time playing in indoor environments. We need to be reminded that this is a Charger first with the ability to play Radio and line in CD/Tape. I find the DW911 particularly useful when it comes to charging different batteries (9.6 to 18 volt). The unit is tougher than it looks...only the antenna has given me problems, but they are an affordable replacement part. Good unit that is perfect for a small cookout or a resting stop during a long road trip.",4.0
"I really like my DeWalt radio, but it is missing one feature...a CD.  I was told that ""no one on a job site would want to mess with a CD"", but who is really buying this?  I think DeWalt didn't do their research before putting out this product.  Otherwise, an outstanding product.  Not only charges, but can run off the DeWalt battery.  Never buy batteries for your portable radio again!",4.0
"Absolutely great product.  I needed to mobilize my Delta 105-inch band saw and this really fit the bill.  Assembly was straight-forward and instructions accurate.  When they say to use oak, maple or other hardwood, they mean it.  I glued two 3/4-inch maple boards together to get the rails which need to be strong.",4.0
"If your a DeWalt user like me, you'll love this charger. The fact that you have another charger on the jobsite is reason enough to buy one. But since  this charger can crank out the tunes makes it that much better. It plays  off of DeWalt batteries so you don't have to worry about extension cords.  You can also hook up a Discman to it. The only downfall for me is the range  of the antennae. It would be nice if I could pick up more stations. Other  than that, it rocks",4.0
"The radio/charger is a great addition to my DeWalt collection of tools and accessories but the DW911 needs to be updated. A digital tuning system to  lock in the weaker stations and add a little boom to the bass response. And  while we are adding to the work part of the radio, why not add a four-plug  gang box to the boombox. Now that would work for everyone. That will take  it to FIVE stars.",4.0

"Bosch has always been on my top ten list of manufacturers to buy.  I needed a sliding compound miter real bad and didn't want to pay the standard $400-750 for one.  I've looked at and used many of the brands that are currently on the market.  Bosch's 10"" slider is comfortable to use and isn't as heavy as I thought it would be.  It is exceptionally quiet and the sliding motion is very smooth.  All of the adjustments are relativly easy to make.  The saw is ergonomic and affortable.",4.0
THe Bosch 3915 is a great addition to my power tool collection. I was impressed with it's ability to cut 2x8's and 10's as well as fine trim. The rails have little play and can give you very accurate angle cuts in both miter and bevel positions cut after cut. The only thing that could be improved is the dust bag chute. IT clogs very easily when cutting undried (framing) lumber.,4.0

I would give it 5 stars if it had a laser...but I would not spend another hundred dollars for a laser.  Unit came out of the box right to spec.  Although I checked for adjustments, none were needed.

"I like this saw.  I use it as often as I do any of my other circular saws and I mainly use it to break down 4x8 sheet goods, including some hefty 7/8"" flooring.  I love the size, weight and balance of this saw, and it doesn't seem to lack for power either.  It does seem loud for it's size and power.  High quality carbide-toothed blades are difficult to impossible to find for this saw, which is a pity because I would love to get more use out of it than I do now.  For cutting laminate and composite materials cleanly, there's just no getting around using a high tooth count carbide tipped blade, which as far as I am aware, is not an option for this saw.",4.0
"The saw arrived whenstated,and was put to use right away. My crew enjoys using the saw, especially when repairing verticle cedar siding. The only hang up of this saw , is that it requires a one-half inch arbor. Most blade mfgrs.have three-eighths
 arbors. Other blades come with five-eighths arbors and require a 'spacer' ring.
 This ring can get lost , also  we need 18 and 24 tooth carbides for this saw.

"Nice saw. I have a great makita saw , so why this saw too. My makita is larger and much heavier. This saw is a dream to use and it really saves my strenth. Dont throw that big one away however you'll still need it for angle cuts on your 2bys. I do so few angle cuts I used it once on the two jobs I did. I am just like everyone else I hate to spend the money on tools I already have. After using this smaller saw, I must say if you do any amount of building this is amust have tool. The weight difference is a big factor in the handling of your saw over the length of your job. Old school you bust your butt with everything, if you don't have to , don't!!! TRy IT bro's, you'll love it . I ain't a contractor I am just a homeowner with a huge honey-do list. So, make it easy on yourself and bother the old lady by spending that money.

"I've been a professional highend custom builder for 17 years in which time I've bought several miter saws.  There's three things I look for in a good miter saw.  Consistancy, accuracy & value.

After disabling the detents, I discovered that the Miter scale is not accurate either.  The scale is a cast in feature (not machined or adjustable)

I was also looking for a corded saw because keeping up with battery technology is getting expensive and I don't need the portability for this tool.  Poewr is good, and overall I am very pleased with this saw.",4.0
Love this saw although it's missing a few key things in my mind. Not to be stereotypical of women but I find that I can't safely use the saw with one hand the way some people with stronger forearms might. The saw is missing a forward grip so you can use two hands to stabilize it. I had to make a piece with plumbing parts and attach it myself. The little 5inch cordless Ryobi has this grip - so should this one. Also there is no place to store the little blade wrench which should be kept with the saw itself. I had to duck tape mine to the saw because otherwise when you need it you might have a hard time finding it. Otherwise powerful little saw - they just need to improve the design a little.,4.0
"Professional here, many years of looking at this thing on the STOREshelves and then they became harder to find!
I finally needed one for a good size custom woodwork job. Light yet powerful, better long day performance than any cordless type.

"The Delta 12"" drill press is OK for a bench top model.  I was disappointed in the chuck as it tends to stick and requires using the key at all times rather than just for final tightening.  Also I believe I would rather have had the 5/8"" chuck that comes on the 16"" floor model more than the 1/2"" chuck supplied with the 12"".  For the extra hundred and fifty (approx) bucks I should have bought the larger floor model and got better capacity, longer quill stroke, larger and more stable table for mounting fences and jigs, etc.
In the 12"" presses defense, it was and is the nicest of the benchtop models I have seen.",4.0
"Just got this one for home and have already used put it to good use.  So  far, I've drilled holes ranging from 0.025"" up to 1"" and have  loved the ease by which you can make adjustments.

Drill  depth is easy to set (although the scale is confusing at first).  Smooth  feed with good drawback.  Nice startup, and a quiet hum.  The thing was  also easy to put together.  The chuck is not the best (not fully  concentric or something, doesn't grab drill bits as tight as it should) and  I will probably replace it at some point.  And like all drill  presses,(listen up Human Interface guys at Delta), this one lacks a place  to handily keep the chuck key!!!  Once out of the box, I immediately  drilled a hole in the plastic cover and affixed a make-shift chuck-key  holder.  Also...the safety key (for the power switch) should have a home  on the device (which it does not).  Regardless....a fine, fine tool, well  worth the money!",4.0
Bought it 2 years ago and works great.  Runs smooth and quiet.  Speed changes are very easy.  Table is a little small.  I built a bigger table to sit on top of the factory one.

"I received the Bosch 3915 today, and of course had to test it out.  First of all, I was impressed with the overall quality of the saw and was very impressed by its weight.  It's heavy, and I have yet to find a really easy way to pick it up and move it around.  I'm assuming that it's meant to be mounted on a bench or stand, as opposed to being moved around from place to place.  I was also impressed with the manual, since it seems to be written in English and for the most part explains things very clearly.  Often, manuals that come with tools made in other countries suffer in their translation.  I did experience one situation that was not explained well in the manual, however.  I tried cutting a dado by using the depth stop feature, which in itself is easy to adjust.  The problem I encountered in making a dado is this:  When the piece of wood is placed on the table and pushed against the fence, the blade does not make a uniformly deep cut all the way through the piece because of the curvature of the blade.  I assume that there are two solutions to this problem.  One would be to turn the piece around and make the same cuts from the opposite side.  Another wouuld be to put a second piece of wood against the fence and then put the piece in which you want the dado in front of that piece.  Either of these methods is rather inconvenient, but maybe I'm missing something.  If anyone has a solution, please let me know.

Previous to using the saw, I checked all of the adjustments as explained in the manual and found that they all seemed to be set perfectly.  I also cut several test pieces and checked them for squareness and various angles; they were all perfect.  I haven't yet used the saw for crown moulding, so I can't comment on how well it does for that purpose.  As far as the operation of the saw itself, I was generally satisfied.  Since I have been using a miter saw that has a vertical handle most of my life I had no issue with the handle on this saw.  I do realize, however, that some folks prefer a horizontal handle.  The one feature I don't like is the placement of the power switch lock-off button that has to be depressed before the power switch can be pushed in.  No matter how I contort my hand I can't find a comfortable way to depress both buttons at the same time.  On my other miter saw, the lock-off button is perfectly placed so that both buttons can be easily depressed at the same time.

Lastly, I have to agree with other reviewers about the uselessness of the dust bag.  I tried turning it it every direction possible, but nothing helped.  It doesn't collect much dust regardless if I make chop cuts or sliding cuts.  And, yes, I do slide the blade from front to back as explained in the manual.  So, overall, I would give the saw 4 1/2 stars, but since that's not possible I gave it the four stars because of the lock-off switch, the dust bag, and the dado situation.",4.0
"Being a rank beginner to woodworking but not to power tools, I purchased this miter saw as a starting point to my woodworking hobby.  I needed it to construct the window seat frame in our new log home.  After 10 cuts on 2x4's, the switch shorted out on the saw.  I contacted Bosch and found a tool supply store who could do the warranty work - simply replacing the defective switch.  After 4 weeks, they finally received the switch from Bosch and I was back in business.  They stopped carrying Bosch tools because of the delays in getting parts and orders from Bosch.  If I had ordered a Makita or Hitachi saw, I would have been repaired in less than a week.  I'm glad I bought the saw but it was a toss-up between the other 2 and $$$ was a factor.

"I bought this base for my Rikon lathe, which weighs about 150-lb with its stand.  The corner supports seem to be well made and the wheels are heavy-duty.  After reading several reviews, I decided not to use hardwood for the 4 sides - the thought of drilling all those holes, in the right places and perfectly perpendicular, didn't set well with me.  Rather, I went to Lowes and bought their 1-1/2"" pre-drilled steel tubes (see photos).  The pre-drilled holes are on 1-inch centers, so they're perfectly spaced for attaching the tubes to the four corner pieces - I didn't have to drill ANY holes.  I'm sure that saved at least an hour of set-up time.

The worst part about putting it together is the instructions that come in the box.  They are somewhat vague, and the illustrations in the instruction sheets are black & white photos that are VERY blurry.  And, the photos were taken too far away from the stand to be of much use - it would help a LOT if Delta would provide clear, close-up, detailed photos.  I got SOME help by studying the color photos on the box, but again, those photos weren't close-enough to see the details I needed to see.  The other negative is that there were no lock-washers for the bolts that shoulder the weight of the tool that's on top of the base - and the bolts provided were barely long enough to fully thread the nuts onto.  Going to have to keep an eye on those nuts to make sure they're not backing-off...

Other than that, once assembled, the lathe now rolls around on my concrete floor with ease.  The foot-pedal ""brake"" works well - it takes very little effort to raise and lower the brake, and when it's in the ""stowed"" (up) position, the lathe is solidly planted on the floor.  (That was a concern to me as, from the photos, you can see how the lathe is significantly top-heavy.)

I would buy one of these again, but would hope that by the time I do, Delta will update their instruction sheets to include detailed close-up photos or illustrations.",4.0

"Simple to attach, however the image does not show that there is a plug on the end, I thought it might have hooked up internally.  No big deal as I had an available outlet on my work bench.  The two screws that have to be removed in order to mount the lamp must have been tightened by some massive piece of machinery, I was able to hook an extender on the supplied allen wrench to break them loose.  I don't think I was able to tighten to the factory setting, but if they do vibrate loose CA glue will fix the problem.

The only reason I gave it four stars is that the supplied bulb isn't all that bright, but it does help.  If the bulb were brighter I would have given it all 5 stars.  I must say that due to the very low vibration level of the machine itself, there is no vibration movement of the light when the machine is running.",4.0

The blade that came with the saw was poor, Chinese made, not carbide tipped, and I used it for one cut before changing to a quality blade.

Otherwise a great saw and welcome replacement for my other 5.5 inch saw  which I finally wore out in over 18 years use.

"I have used my new saw a few times now and really like the saw. As stated in many of the other reviews, the dust collection system is horrible. I even removed the dust bag and attached a vacuum and still had saw dust all over. I purchased the extensions and a spare clamp with my saw. The spare clamp is not as nice as the one that comes with the saw. The blade that comes with the saw is a quality blade and the overall machine feels and looks sturdy. Bosch put a lot of time and thought into this machine.
Great saw at a great price!",4.0
"I bought this saw to be attached to the Delta Universal Stand and on that stand it is a very substantial rig.  The saw came out of the box only needing a slight adjustment for bevel.
As some have already said, saws cut therefore create dust, and this saw is no different than any of those so don't expect it to be.
This is a very smooth running, accurate power tool, though one or two changes would make it better:
1)Horizontal handle - I had an old cheap delta saw that had it and it's a GREAT feature.
2)Include the out feed supports.  I'm tired of manufacturers selling just the basic tool and then selling all the accessories to make the tool fully functional separately.
I gave it 4 stars only because 4 3/4 wasn't an option and I think 5 stars is reserved for an item with no criticism.
Highly recommend",4.0
"I agree with all the reviews about this saw being sturdy and precise out of the box.  With Amazon's price and deal it certainly is a great value compare to other sliding miter saws.
The biggest disappointment that I have is the very poor dust collection system.  I had my saw hook up to a powerful dust collection system (not just a shopvac), but just after a few simple cuts, there are saw dust everywhere!  It threw dust around a 4 feet radius around the base!  Maybe I am used to good dust collection system from a table saw and jointer, but I did not expect it to be this bad.  Maybe this is a common problem for all miter saws and it is acceptable for a job site or an outdoor project, but if you plan to use this saw in a basement woodshop, prepare for a lot of cleaning afterward!!
This is too bad because I would use this saw a lot more if it has a better dust collection system.",4.0
"I have had this saw for 6 months now.  I use it often and well it is a nice saw for the price.  I think there are other saws out there that have more bells an whistles than this one.  Having a horizontial tigger like the Dewalt would be nice, kind of cumbersome with the saftey trigger on the left.  My biggest complaint is the saw blade.  After only using it for 1 month I noticed burning,tearout,and bogging down on the motor.  I changed the blade with a freud ultimate cutoff and what a differnce a blade makes!!  Slices wood (walnut,maple,redwood,and mahagony) very clean and precise.  I have read that the Makita has a nice blade included with their model and the Hitachi with the LAZER sounds cool ($500.00) but this saw was good for the price.  The dust collection is middle of the road ,but to be fair I have not seen many that work that well.  It did come with a hold down clamp that works ok.  The base is kind of large too...luckly I was able to land a Werkart cart that fit it perfectly and all and all Ive turned it into quite the compound miter saw.",4.0

"I'm not writing a review on the use of the base as I have yet to work with it enough to give it a fair review.  My review has to do with the assembly. I, like many others, had an issue with the bolt length. No matter how hard I tried to get the nut to thread on the two-inch bolt it seemed like I just couldn't get enough thread to get it started. So, here's a solution that will cost you about fifty cents:
Go to the hardware store and buy two 2.5"" bolts (5/16 #8, if my memory serves me).  Use those two bolts with a pair of nuts that came with the kit and tighten the bracket on the wood.  Once tightened, remove the nuts/bolts and now use the Delta 2"" nut that came with the kit.  You'll see that since the bracket got clamped down on the wood, the width of the bracket has been reduced and there's now plenty of thread.",4.0
"This base is plenty sturdy to hold my Jet jointer, which weighs over 300lbs (with a 50lb sandbag inside for stability).  I was a little concerned with using hardwood for the supports, but the red oak I used seems to be plenty strong.  I like the lifting mechanism, which is nearly identical to the one found on my Delta 36-725 table saw.  It provides enough clearance to lift the jointer over some minor cracks/gaps in my garage floor.

In hindsight, I would have preferred a model that came with the metal supports instead of having to supply the 1.5""x1.5"" hardwood.  Additionally, I had to get slightly longer bolts as many have mentioned.  My local hardware stores didn't have any 2.25"" length bolts, which would have been ideal as the 2.5"" bolts stick out of the base further than I would like.  The bolts must be installed such that the ends protrude outside the base -- would be better if the bolts could be inserted from the outside (with the heads of the bolts on the outside).  There are other mobile bases in the same price range that do come with all the parts needed and would be easier to set up.  I will likely select one of these for my next mobile base purchase.",4.0
"What a pain in the butt to put together. Also, be aware that it will only go down to 16 inches in  width because of the rear lift wheel. I bought it for a jet jointer and as most jointers go they are very narrow bases, so this cant be made tight. Its strong but just a pain to assemble. I'm not sure if Id buy another UPDATE actually after getting it all together,it does require some patience, it really is a pretty good stand. The size as far as my jointer goes worked out well and the few inches extra width I think helped stabilize it better. Don't try to get it too tight, the bolt heads stick out and you lose some size. But actually I kinda like it and would probably get another",4.0

"90% of the work I do is installing doors and windows in older homes.  I use this saw to cut siding back and interior trim to allow for the new windows or doors to fit properly. This saw is perfect for this.  It is light weight and the right size to get into those tight spaces.  It hasn't lacked in power to do any of this.  The one disappointing shortcoming of this saw however is it will not cut all the way through a 1 3/4"" door. It lacks an 1/8"" at the most to be able to do it.  I have to pull my 7 1/4"" saw out for that.  You should also be careful of the base.  My saw fell from 3 feet onto carpet and the base bent on the corner.  I was able to bend it back but be careful.",4.0
"I got this saw to replace my 18v DeWalt 5-3/8"" cordless trim saw, which is underpowered and can't handle much more than thin plywood and short cuts on 2x4s. The Skil saw completely blows it away in terms of power. I did like the fit and feel of the DeWalt better, but that was probably due more to the fact that it was cordless than anything else. The Skil saw is a terrific alternative to bulkier and heavier 7-1/4"" circular saws. I almost never need to cut wood that thick except on my table saw anyway. I have a feeling my 7-1/4"" circular saw is going to collect a lot of dust now that I have added this smaller Skil saw to my shop.

The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is that it didn't come with a rip fence and because the arbor hole in the saw blade that came with it is considerably larger than the arbor on the saw. The rip fence can be purchased separately, but it seems kind of chintzy that they wouldn't include it. As for the blade, well, I'm not sure what they were thinking.",4.0

"Base works well but if I had it to do over I would buy an all steel base. Using wood ,I thought , would be a quick job. I found some oak and planed it and cut it to be the size of the base of the machine . I drilled the holes and began to assemble  the base when I realized there would be not be enough room between the corner brackets for the retractable wheel . I had to cut two new pieces of wood to make the base wider so I could fit the wheel. Now the base was bigger than the machine . Making a few shims to take up the space the problem was solved.  After all this the base works like a charm but  all the cutting and drilling was not worth not buying a pre-made base.",4.0

"I looked at them all and went with this saw.  If you are left handed....look for something else.  The trigger is strickly for us righties.....The blade is a 60 tooth which means you have to go buy an 80 tooth if you want a tear free cut for moulding and the such....wish they had mentioned that.  It is a solid saw though at a good price.  I worry about the automatic blade brake as it is one more thing to break over time.  I would have given it 5 stars, but they didn't ship a screw to hold the board clamp to the saw.  This tells me their quality control may not be the hottest, but the price isn't that bad so it's a trade off.  I would make sure that everything is held down properly prior to turning it on though.  If they forget to include a part it just makes me look to make sure everything is ok safety wise.  I put on the dust collection bag....why I don't know it still blows sawdust everywhere, but I guess they all do that. This is still the best saw for the money on the market.  From date of order it was 7 days to my door with the Amazon free shipping.",4.0
"After a couple of years of watching prices, developments of the different manufacturers, features, ratings, and drooling over store displays, I finally decided to make a purchase.  I had wrestled with the idea of a fixed versus a sliding saw type, but ultimately decided that a sliding compound miter saw would best serve my needs.
I had pretty much leaning toward Hitachi, but was leery of the miter detent system.  As I was again eyeballing the Hitachi and the Bosch, (which happened to be displayed side by side), a local builder recognized my dilemma and offered his two cents worth.  He said he had both saws, (actually two Hitachis and one Bosch) and though the Hitachi was very rugged and reliable, he found that he and his crew gravitated to the Bosch when they needed a precision cut.  When asked about the ruggedness of the Bosch, he had no complaints, but he hadn't owned it as long as the others.  That confirmed my own conclusion regarding the superiority of the Bosch miter detent system, and swung my decision in favor of the Bosch 3915.
The saw set up easily, is easily adjusted, and cuts like a dream. I have yet to connect it to a dust collection system, but find the collection bag to work reasonably well.  The miter detent and locking system is positive and positively marvelous.  It really instills confidence that settings and cuts will be accurate and repeatable.  The detent system is also easily disengaged when the need arises.
The braking system works well.....but the clamp cannot be beat.  (I have ordered a second clamp and recommend that anyone buying this saw buy a second clamp, it's that handy.) The depth of cut adjustment feature could be better, but in two years I have only used this feature once!
In my considered opinion, the Bosch 3915 is well worth the money.  I expect it to keep a prominent place in my workshop for many years.",4.0
"After much thought and research I decided to purchase the Bosch 10"" Sliding Miter Saw. It arrived via Fedex with a couple of minor ""dings"" in the box, but the packing of the saw was outstanding and no damage to the saw was evident. Set-up was easy and the ""factory alignment"" was right on except for a slight loose allen screw on the slide bearings. The saw is not light so i would hate to lug it around to job sites with out wheels of some type. My saw will stay in the shop on the bench. The Saw cut 2x4's with ease and all cuts were clean and accurate. I have also used it to cut 5/4""x6"" oak and again the saw had no difficulty. The two reasons I didn't give this saw five stars are that blade changes are a pain complicated by having to remove alot of the guard and the operating handle is mounted vertically instead of horizontally which makes it difficult to operate with your left hand. Overall I would still purchase this saw again over everthing else out there. It was/is the best value for the money.",4.0
"I've been impressed with this saw, and if I were going to buy a new saw today (Fall 2002) would by this same one again at this time. Projects have included 3/4"" solid oak molding and melamine closet organizers. Both with the same very good 60 tooth blade that comes with the saw. I did quite a bit of research and knew what I would add to the product to make it better before I even ordered it. See Bosch's 12"" compound miter saw for most of the improvements. I will summarize them:
1. Offset motor so right side clamping is possible.
2. +/- 45 deg bevel capability.
3. D handle that can be rotated or is horizontal.
4. Solid throat plate that you cut through as you use the saw to reduce rip-out.
5. Adjustable rear fence to reduce rip-out at the back.
6. Better placement dust port and 3"" dust collection port.
I have a shop vac hooked to the dust collection port and I would say it still only catches 40-50% of the saw dust generated. I did have to adjust the miter for accuracy. And the work clamp that comes with the saw works great - a must for any miter cuts on hard wood. I did order the extension supports and have yet to get them...",4.0
"This saw was purchased 5 years ago for its compactness to fit into a kit box. I did work in art direction & set construction on films at that time.
I'm right handed so I love having the blade on the left for visibility of the cut. Be sure to keep your left hand clear!!  Saws intended for homeowners have the blade on the right for greater safety.
I found the motor housing to be in the way when using a guide to rip or crosscut plywood sheets. This was also mentioned by a previous reviewer.
My major complaint is that this saw is very LOUD compared to the equivalent Porter Cable model. (I don't know if it's just my saw - there aren't that many hours on it. ) I would probably choose the P-C if I had to do it again. BTW I do wear ear protection.

"This is a reasonable mobile base.  I have purchased several of these for tools I own that are weird sizes - e.g., a large Grizzly Band-saw, a large router table, and a Grizzly spindle sander.  I like the design as it's simple and sturdy, as long as you use 2"" aluminum square stock and not wood. I first tried one of these bases with the wood they recommend and it's worthless, far too flimsy for anything but a light tool.  I bought 2"" x 1/4"" wall square aluminum stock and have had excellent results.  Needless to say aluminum costs more than wood, but it's worth it and with it, these are great bases.",4.0
"Received my new Bosch slide compund miter saw just two days ago. It arrived in excellent condition and is the smoothest saw I've ever used. My selection of this brand was based upon the performance of my other Bosch tools as well as the very helpful reviews on this site.
I had only one simple adjustment to make by which the blade is made ninety degrees to the table.
The only reason I do not give the saw 5 stars is because of the (you guessed it) dust collection. So far, the bag has picked up nothing. Will try a vacuum adaptor next but I really don't think this will prove much better. No big thing since I live in a world of saw dust anyway and, after all, what is a shop without saw dust?
Am I satisfied with the saw enough to recommend it? You bet.",4.0
"I've had this saw for over six months now and am extremely satisfied.  It's very accurate, easy to adjust and is particularly good for cutting crown molding.  The blade which comes with the saw is OK for basic stuff, but has excessive tearout.  For fine work you'll need a good 80 tooth blade. It's a little awkward for a left-hander at first, but easy to adapt to.  The biggest complaint is the dust extraction - the dust bag is almost useless, and hooking a vacuum to the dust port makes no difference:  dust shoots straight out the back, hits the frame and disperses in a huge cloud.  This makes it impossible to use in a customer's home; if it's a row house, finding a safe, convenient outdoor spot for it can be tricky.  Wintertime complicates matters.  One reviewer said, so what if it takes an extra hour to clean up - it's a terrific saw.  Well, it is a terrific saw, but time is money.",4.0
"This is a decent stand for the money. I used it on my older (1980's) and heavy Delta Unisaw and it has been holding up well. I made my own caster system for the table extension by making a box that slips over the legs with notches or ears so to speak for the casters to be at the correct level. That can only be determined by the caster size you choose. The long extension table follows well enough for my use without buying the much more expensive ""correct"" model for that saw. The four no five stars are because of the one problem I had with the assembly. Some of the bolts were about a half the nuts thickness short. I had to replace them because I was afraid they would strip out in time.",4.0
So far this is a good product.  The only design challenge I see is that the foot pedal that engages the mobility wheel is wide to the point  it cannot be placed on the narrow side of my jointer.  The jointers side is 14.5 wide as it is a 6 jet jointer.  That having been said; I must place the mobility wheel in front of the machine instead of on the side where it would provide the most mobility.  If you have a narrow machine you should bare this design challenge in mind.  If you have a larger machine (like a band saw) it should not be a problem.,4.0

In the garage the stand rolls well, but it is tipsy on the one wheel end.  Just something for you to note.  I thought that the whole thing was going to fly over one day when I was moving it quickly out of the way to get to my router table.  Lesson learned - be deliberate and you will be fine.  The wheels are also on the smaller end so getting it back into the garage requires lifting the wheels over the 3/4 inch drop.  Other than that it is exactly what I needed to save my back.

"The Delta Universal Mobile Base works as well as I expected, and in the long run it should be a very worthwhile investment.  At 22' x 24', my basement shop is spacious compared to the spaces I used to have to work in, but it is still not large enough to have dedicated space for all machines.  Only my table saw, drill press, and bandsaw get that.  This base was purchased for my 6"" Delta jointer, which is pretty heavy to slide across the floor otherwise.  The base allows me to position the jointer exactly where I have the open space and where I can reach it with my dust collector.  Really, the the only complaint I have is that of the 18 carriage bolts it came with, 10 of them were 1/16"" too short, which wouldn't allow the nuts to even start threading on.  So I went to the hardware store to buy REAL 2"" long carriage bolts, only to find out that they were 1/16"" short too.  Fortunately, I found this out while in the store, so I bought the next size longer, which was 2-1/2"".  Now they stick out too far and need to be trimmed.  If the base would have just come with 2-1/4"" long carriage bolts (if they exist) in the first place, I could have saved a trip to the store.  This was a minor annoyance, but Delta really should just fix the problem.  I would buy more of these if I needed them, but everything else is either going to stay fixed or already has wheels.",4.0

So if your a contractor that will be using this saw in the great outdoors this is definitely the saw for you (or have it mounted on a Portable stand!!). Sure saws make sawdust (genius!!) but I never owned a miter saw that was this poor in collecting dust.. It was as if the Bosch Engineers where done with the design, and said, ""We have made the Best Slide Miter saw in the World"", then one said ""Ah-Oh we forgot to incorporate Dust Collection"", and the other said, ""Ah just hang a bag on it""!!.

So, as long as it turned on, it would be a vast improvement over my old lamp. It DID turn on, and it is at least as bright as my old craftsman lamp (also 25 watt bulb), but this one can get closer, so it ends up being quite a bit brighter, and I don't have the shadow problems I used to have. The adjustable arm seems kind of loose (I set it where I want it, then it sags down another few inches), so I just set it a lot higher than I wanted it, and it settled down into the position I wanted. I suspect there are better lights out there, but honestly, this one is totally adequate, and a good price. (I got it in the bundle with the saw and stand).",4.0

"I bought this because I have an older Unisaw which can be difficult to fit into one of the other bases.  Let me way that ripping down wood to fit into the base was fairly easy (because of the aforementioned Unisaw).  However, the base does flex some because of the use of wood when popping it up.  I think I would have been better off using some 1-1/2"" square tube instead of wood.  Probably would have ended up stronger and it would have been easier to acquire for me.

The next step will be to see if I can make one of the extension kits interface with this base.  More to follow.

Jun 2011 Update:
I finally swapped out the 2x4 douglas fir for 1-1/2"" square tubing.  After drilling it out, priming and painting, the metal was installed without issue.  I can say the base is far stronger now than it used to be and there is no flex when ""popping"" the stand up on its wheel to move it around.  As a bonus, semi-gloss Rust-Oleum paint blends in with the original Delta paint, giving the base a more factory made look.

All in all, very much an improvement.",4.0

In addition, if you are like me and wanted to store something in a closet out of the way, you need at least 8-12"" of extra space to accommodate the petal.

The assembly is easy enough and I've had no problems with quality of the stand so I have nothing to say in that regard.

The bolts are the lowest grade you can find. they will work, but be careful. I snapped the shaft of one and the head came right off of another.

"I bought this for my circa 1991 Delta Bandsaw I'm rebuilding.  Please note this base (i.e. model number) fits the U.S. Made Bandsaws with an enclosed base, and was the only mobile base listed as of 1997/98 in the Delta Machinery Catalog (for the enclosed base saws).  It measures 17 1/4"" x 19 1/2"" inside the rails with a little extra room (which most mobile bases have, but it's not too much extra).  It's my understanding the new bandsaws (I don't know the cutoff date) have a slightly larger base, and it's a different number.  Whether it fits bandsaws made overseas between 1997/98 and now, I have no idea.

It looked like it was supposed to replace the 4"" thick base that came with the saw, but it didn't fit.  It was about a 1/4"" to narrow for the band saw base to fit in it.  I solved it by putting the regular base back on, and drilling holes in it to bolt the mobile base to the standard base.  With 8 bolts holding it in place it is solid enough, but its about 4 inches higher than normal.  Since I'm a tall guy its not a problem for me.  The mobile base is still a great idea though.

"Overall, a very good product.  For those of us restricted to using a  circular (e.g., skil) saw, using the CMS is a giant leap forward. Compared  to the other models I looked at, I like the built in extensions, the  horizontal position of the handle, and the trigger release for changing  miter positions.  I rarely use the work clamp, but it is a nice feature to  have when you need it.  Dust collection is acceptable.
I could have used  the extra capacity of the 12"" model a few times now, but it wasn't in  the budget, nor in my opinion, worth the extra cost.  Instead, I just flip  the work piece over and make a second cut.  Not exactly a joiner quality  edge, but adequate for my purposes.  My guess is that if you need a precise  miter cut on a board the 10"" model can't handle, you probably ought to  be using a table saw anyway.  Don't get me wrong, this saw is plenty  precise, but double cuts aren't.",4.0

Switching between 1/4"" and 1/2"" collets is simple.  You  can switch back and forth without a concern.

"I just assembled the base with no problems - took about 1 1/2 hours after I glued up 3/4"" thick oak stock to get the required thickness.  I like the look of wood in the base opposed to the all metal ones - after all I'm a woodworker, not a metal fabricator.  If you're one of the reviewers who have complained about the assembly difficulty, I think you've taken up the wrong hobby. Compared to making projects that will later utilize the tools that will set on these bases, assembly was a snap.

Some reviewers have commented on the too-large 7/16"" holes when 5/16"" bolts are used - anothers have commented on the difficulty of getting the hand-drilled holes to align with the holes in the brackets.  I imagine the 7/16"" holes are not a mistake as one reviewer suggested but are intended to compensate for the inherently crooked holes of hand-drilling.  Even though I used a drill press I still used a larger (3/8"") bit and that worked out fine since my holes were still not exactly dead-on.

I'd stick to the recommended hardwood for the stringers - especially for the one that is used to attach the center wheel since that will bear a greater amount of weight than the other three.  You could cut expenses on the other three and rip a 2 x 4 but, for a little more money, you'll like the look of hardwood all around.

I would prefer that the foot pedal that's used to raise and lower the base would not extend out so far.  I feel that might get to be a shin scraper and you don't need that distraction when you're trying to keep your fingers away from a moving tool or saw blade.  But that's the only concern I have with this base and that's a minor issue, all things considered.

They are non servicable rivet on style. Not sure about their durability. I would also like to see replacable wheels instead of the rivet style it comes with.

After opening the packages and making some measurements I choose to cut up some 2x4's as a test assembly and ensure my measurements were right.  I'm glad I made a ""dry run"" with the 2x4's because I would've wasted some good wood if I hadn't.  After the dry run I cut up my poplar, assembled the base, and loaded my table saw on the base.  The dry run took me a while (2 hours) but the real deal took only 1 hour.

I use a Bosch contractors table saw because I have very little space in my garage to store full size table saw.  Prior to the purchase of the base I had to move the saw every time I wanted to cut some wood and the saw isn't lite.  Now I simply depress the foot pedal and move the saw to where it needs to be.  I rate the base as 4 stars because I had to buy some wood.  I think it looks better than other universal bases, but it does require additional effort.  In the end I am extremely pleased with the purchase and bought an identical base for my miter saw.",4.0
works but you need to know how to cut crown first these won't give you the answer.,4.0
"I recently purchased two of the Delta Universal Mobile Base Kits and found them to be everything that they were advertised to be.  They are extremely strong and for the most part work well.
Where I see an issue is in the actually cost of the device.  I was wanting to use the bases for moderately heavy machines - a Benchdog Router Cabinet and a shop built base for a Delta 2 speed planer.  I felt that Oak strechers were required.  The plan calls for 1 1/2 inch hardwood stock.  Each base required between 10 and 12 feet of hardwood.
This is all well and good if you have that much hardwood laying around as scrap but I did not.  The cost through a local lumber company was an additional [amount]of hardwood per base.  In addition the first assembly took 2 to 3 hours.  Cutting and fitting of the hardwood and drilling a number of holes.  Granted the second assembly was much faster.  The actual cost of the units were about [amount] apiece plus about 4 hours shop time.  I had orgionally paid [amount] each for the Delta kits.
The only other issue I have with the units is the level adjustments.  While they work well they are rather primitive.  I use my equipment on a smooth concrete floor that is sloped slightly for drainage.  i.e., not the same slope in all locations.  I find the threaded rod with a nut on each side of the 1 1/2 inch Oak stock a bit slow to adjust the level everytime I move the equipment.
Again this is a great base but is more costly than you might think!",4.0
"I bought one to try for my router table. It assembled fine, considering that I had a radial arm saw and drill press to do the work. I'm buying another for my drill press. However, be prepared to go to your hardware store to pick up the missing carriage bolts and nuts before you start (described by others also). Picking is probably done by weight and someone didn't get their scale calibrated correctly.",4.0
"Pros: Easy to assemble.
  Easy to adjust belt.
  Easy to switch from horizontal to vertical
  Good value for the price.

Cons: It is very loud.
  Arrived damaged: Plastic guard was broken and metal support at head pulley was bent. I was able to bend metal back in shape and epoxy the plastic guard. UPS is not real careful handling parcels and Delta could spend one more dollar on better packaging.

"Great machine for the money - plus free shipping.  went together very easily, but pay attention to the pictures, not the part labels since they're wrong.  Lots of power, but loud, typical of these kinds of machines.  belt tracks true.  disk seems to have fine tolerances.  best for hobbyists and home shops.",4.0
"I needed a sander just to bring things down here and there.  I also have very limited space.  For the price this was a good deal.  Though I couldn't get my disk gaurd to stop hitting the disk sander.  So I just took it off for now.  The sparks where bothering me.

If you want something more stable and variable speeds this isn't it.  This is the hobbyist sander.",4.0
This sander is heavy and seems to be well built. The shipping carton was damaged extensively upon arrival but there were no missing parts. Delta needs to use a stronger carton. The internal styrene packing does not properly support the contents. The assembly was simple and easy and the instructions were clear.  I have used the sander several times and I am very satisfied with its performance.,4.0
"Does it's job, but wasn't quite square.  Had to re-drill holes in the bottom to line up with holes in the base of my Delta closed stand bandsaw.",4.0
"I am using this stand for a compound miter saw. For a light tool like this, pine rails ripped from 2x4s work just fine. If you are trying to support a major league table saw or something closer to the 300 pound limit, then follow Delta's advice and use hardwood.
I bought an HTC mobile stand for my table saw, in part to compare the two models. On design, the Delta wins. The freely rotating front caster makes the unit very maneuverable, much easier to move around the shop than the HTC. In addition, the lever in front gives a much greater range of motion, so it lifts the unit much further off the stationary feet. The two units are roughly equivalent in difficulty of assembly. Do your own measurements for the wood; the unit will take a tad more than the 1 1/2 inch square cross section recommended. I also recommend drilling the bolt holes with a drill press if at all possible. I don't own a drill press, so I couldn't get the holes drilled perfectly square, and the unit looks like it was assembled by a drunken sailor. It works great, but I can't really blame Delta for the appearance.
One downside to the Delta is the need for the hardwood rails for heavier equipment. If you don't have a lot of scrap hardwood lying around, you should include the price of the wood in your price comparison. You should also have access to a planer and joiner to square up the wood, something that wasn't necessary with the pine.",4.0
"Bought 6 more to go with the initial one I tried last year.
All six arrived without the fixed feet in the sealed package, Delta responded quickly and without complaint.
Op note.  While I believe this is the better base, there are some limitations.
The lift mechanism is sturdy and easy  to use  The three point contact obtained, when rolling, provides good mobility on smooth concrete.  When used on (limiting) heavy equipment, however, the lift occurs on mid beam between corners, the resulting twist of the wood beam that supports the retractile roller is objectionable.  For this condition, this one rail can be replaced  or strengthened with a 1 1/2"" x 1/8"" angle to provide stiffness.  For most applications, pine will do for all rails except the lifting beam where the hardwood beam is more appropriate....",4.0
"I ordered two of the mobile bases for my router table and table saw.  When I opened the boxes, BOTH were missing the levelers, which are necessary for the tools to sit flat on the floor.  I called Delta to order the parts, and was told that I may have to wait a couple of weeks to get them.  I have many Delta products, and this is the first time that parts were missing.  I'm sure the mobile bases will work great when I have all of the parts, but Delta needs to have a talk with their packing inspectors!",4.0
This is a good base for a variety of tools that need to be mobile.  The only issue I have with it is the rubber feet.  It's almost impossible to get the castle-nut on it.  The bolt in the rubber foot starts spinning as soon as you apply any torque.  I'm going to have to replace the locking nut with a regular nut and a lock washer..,4.0
"These stops are a GREAT addition to my Dewalt compound miter (DWS780). They are well constructed of heavy duty metal that precludes even the slightest amount of ""give"" when in use.  The only shortfall (literally) is the size of the mounting slots. These stops attach to the sides of the saw with large wing-nuts (provided). The mounting slots could be another inch in length to allow for slightly larger crown moldings, but then how many times do we deal with six inch moldings?",4.0
"Great idea by DeWalt. However, they are cumbersome to put on and the angles needed tweeking to get them straight. These will give you a false sense of security, though. I say that because I bought finger jointed paintable pine mouldings at a big-box store and all the dimensions were not perfectly the same from board to board (different lots and manufacturers? Dunno). But based on my assumptions, I was relying on the stops and not checking closely enough and ended up with troubles.",4.0
Works Great! Fast Shipping!,4.0
"They do what they are supposed to and are made pretty well.  I wish the side arm was long enough to slide it forward and down out of the way when not in use.  As it is, I loosen the knob far enough so I can drop it off the front to park them when they are not in use but it ends up at an odd angle (looks funny when not in use).  The size of crown molding is also limited by the side arm length so it would help a couple issues if it was longer.

These come with threaded clips that have to be stuck up under the saw for the knobs to screw in to.  These were needed for my 708 saw which had over sized holes that are not threaded.  The clips are loose so if you back the knob out too far they may drop out (not a great design).

I thought the price was reasonable for what I got (unlike the quick release clamps).",4.0
This Mobile Base does a fine job of moving equipment.  The only drawback is letting the base down to the floor after use.  There is not enough length on the foot lever forward of the hinge point.  The base drops rather abruptly to the floor.  I extended the lever with a length of hardwood and can now lower the base smoothly and softly.,4.0
"The Delta mobile kit does the job. Just a push of the lever, and your are  moving 300 pounds across the floor. Can easily rearrange the shop in  seconds. A drill press is must to put the base together.  Did not bother to  use hard wood for smaller equipment...ripped some pt for the the rails.  Instructions for assembly need improvement....don't drill the extra hole in  the ends of the rails!! Careful with the clip the secures the hinge for the  foot lever..it will fly across the room if it slips out of your pliers  during installation...tough little bugger to find.",4.0
"This mobile base works great.  It allows me to effortlessly push my table saw around my shop.  It did take about 2 hours to assemble.  I was going back and forth between this base and the universal base with the metals  side supports.  I spent a lot more than $10 in wood, so the universal  mobile base may end up being cheaper.",4.0
"This base I found to be fairly well made and the assembly was straight forward. So far I have found that moving my jointer has been a breeze and it quite simple to operate.

"As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708, the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars.  Sturdy construction, particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece, but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides, removing for steep beveling, etc).",4.0
"I got these after the purchase of my new Dewalt saw and I am fairly happy with them. The only issue I had was when cutting a piece of stained furniture crown, after making my first cut I slid the crown down the saw to make my next one and the sharp edges of the stops cut all the stain off. I used masking tape on the face of the stops to prevent this again. Aside from that I would recommended them.",4.0
I used these a few times then started not using them.  Seems like its easier for me not to use them.  But they will work for you if you set it up it will give you repeatable results.

"I purchased this tool when I was building rocking horses out of solid 2"" white oak.  By the time I glued the pieces together, I was sanding nearly 6"" of solid oak.  The machine worked great.  Assembly was easy, adjustments quick, and the machine works as advertised.  The motor has plenty of power and changing sand paper is easy and quick.
What kept it from getting a 5 rating was the fact that the table for the drum sander portion isn't as sturdy as I would like to have seen.  It needs to be re-set occasionally to insure it is aligned.  Definately needs either a shop vac or dust system when using it as the dust sure flys.  I would recommend it as an addition as I use it all the time to round over corners on small items, cleanup saw marks on heavy stock, etc.",4.0
"I like the sander and think that it does a very good job for the price.

"After obtaining the DW712 8.5"" SCMS from Amazon, found this DW7082 material clamp (now part #153650-00) listed on servicenet. DeWalt.com. Purchased and found it to be very solid and strong in holding power. With the quick release button, setting the height is very fast. This is the best clamp I've used (have owned 4-different brand sliders), but also one of the more expensive hold downs (reason for only 4 stars)!",4.0
If your reading this you discovered that your Dewalt came without a clamp. This is the mother of all clamps. Heavy duty is the word I would use. Fits perfectly in the oversize hole in your Mitre saw. Reaches over the oversize fence on your mitre saw as well. I tried to find any other manufacturer clamp to use as a substitute but no this is it for Dewalt. You 'have to' buy this one if you want a clamp. You either return the saw or give up and pay the ridiculous price. Is it a $80 part. No. Its more like a $40 part. Do you have a choice no. Do you need 2? I don't think so. Its massive. Has a quick release on the screw down. Good size knob you can work wearing gloves. Does all this make up for the price. No.,4.0

"I'm not a big fan of Dewalt, but even the worst companies do at least some things right.  Dewalt did this one right.

It's built well, works well, and it's priced right.  What more do you need?

Setting the depth is foolproof, and the depth stays consistent.

I use it more often for cement backerboard with durock screws than I do drywall.  But for either job, I'm totally  happy with its performance.

If you're a homeowner/occassional user, the price puts this in the realm of serious consideration.  If you've got three or four sheets of drywall to put up, you don't need it.

If you think you'll do more than one project in your lifetime though, spend the 90 bucks.  It's SO MUCH faster than the cordless drill approach.  And you won't over/under drive your screws (assuming you set the depth correctly to begin with, of course).

One word of warning to the casual user - Remember that this is a professional level tool. The instructions assume you're a pro.  You won't just pick this thing up and start using it like a pro.

Expect to have to practice a little with it first, until you get the technique down.  You typically run this thing all out at top speed without letting up on the trigger between screws.  Most people have trouble until they figure that out.

It's not a regular drill where you have to slowly bring the screw up to speed. With drywall guns, the bit doesn't turn till you push the screw to the wall, when it catches it drives the screw at top speed, then stops turning once it hits the right depth.  It all happens in the blink of an eye.

You can't be overly careful with the thing, you have to put a screw on and jam it in with one quick decisive motion.  Being timid with it only gets crooked screws driven half way.

I'd recommend using the shortest screws you can get by with until you get profficient with it.

So there's a bit of an art to it (and this applies to all drywall guns, not just this one).  But nothing you shouldn't be able to pick up very quickly.

There are other good ones out there, but nothing I'd recommend over this one.

And if you're thinking cordless - don't do it.  Cordless tools have their place, but this isn't one of them.  As mentioned above, you want to keep this thing pegged as you're popping screws in.  Having a power cord attached to you is a very small price to pay for never having to worry about a constantly diminishing battery charge.

(oh and only 4 stars because the instructions really are kind of useless, and I think they should include a case with some extra bits - they have to box the thing anyways, how much more would a blow molded case cost them instead?  50 cents?...  The tool itself gets 5 stars)",4.0

If there is a fault, it's with the miter saw itself.  The holes for the clamp post in the saw's base could be placed better, and the saw wasn't designed with other clamping methods in mind.

"I've been using the clamp on the left side of the DeWalt 8.5"" sliding compound miter saw.

There is a quick-release button that drops the clamping screw down very quickly and this can be done with one hand.  However, loosening it with one hand is more difficult.  You can unscrew the clamp one-handed, but releasing the quick release takes two hands.  On the right hand side, the clamp works for straight cuts, but gets in the way of any cuts with the saw swung to the right (the side that goes to steeper angles).",4.0
"These attach to the side of the DeWalt miter saw, and you manually set the depth by placing your moulding on the fence.

"The regular HD77 is known for excellent balance, as well as being one of the best saws available.  However, it appears that in knocking 2 lbs off of the MAG version, Skil has inadvertently unbalanced the saw from side to side.  If you hold the saw by the forward handle, you will notice that the saw droops to the left.  Skil would have had to redesign the saw to avoid this problem, so the situation is understandable.  The saw still handles very well, however, and the weight reduction may be worth it.  Unlike some comments about the Bosch, the foot/plate/shoe seems quite secure without play and well aligned.  If you are trying to do finish cuts on pieces of wood for furniture with this saw, you are probably out of your head, and I don't consider that a defect of the saw.  As others have noted, the blade supplied by Skil is trash.  It is puzzling as to why they would sell a top of the line saw with such a blade.

"Unlike some other users, I've replaced my belt sander with this one.
The good points of this sander have to do with it being very powerful and a random orbit sander.  Powerful is good for smoothing large surfaces quickly.  Quickly is good for me because I hate sanding so much (I own at least seven electric sanders -- I must hate it).  Random orbit is good, frankly, because you never get the surprises that an instant of inattention with a belt sander gets you (I am in awe of those of you who get perfect results every time with a belt sander -- you are better than me).  This machine is nearly as aggressive as my P-C belt sander, and much less likely to carve low spots or dig in an edge.
The bad part is that it is much harder to handle than a smaller, less powerful random orbit sander.  It took me a while to develop a smooth technique with it, and it still sometimes wants to ""walk"" off the work piece.  I use it for preliminary sanding on flat surfaces before assembly.  I think it would be a poor choice for sanding small parts of an assembled piece, and a disastrous choice for something with a lot of different surface levels close to each other (a rolltop desk, small table, chair, etc.)
I use it where I used to use my belt sander, and finish sand by hand or with my small random orbit sander.
By the way, it sands like mad.  It's fast.  It's aggressive.  I love it.

I won a Dewalt DW421 in a contest about 5 years ago.  I traded it in and paid the difference to upgrade to this sander.  The first 2 or 3 failed out of the box with motor and/or gear problems.  After finding one that performed properly I put it to the test.  I have used the 97366 with the dust collection system to sand cultured marble sinks and smooth walls that I had recently plastered.  The dust was minimal while using my shop vacuum.  It performs very good to excellent in sanding both soft and extreemly hard surfaces.  This is one of the best investments I have made in my shop!,4.0

The catalog said the stand was for the model Delta band saw that my husband owns (BS100) but it did not have holes located in the appropriate positions so it could not be bolted down. We were only able to utilize it after he drilled his own holes to make it fit.,4.0
I purchased this stand for my belt/disc sander and it fits perfectly.  I also discovered it is just right for my bench top drill press so I purchased another.  Nice and sturdy with convenient storage underneath.,4.0
"This is basically a good sander but there are some issues that I discovered. The wheel has axial runout of 0.020 inch at the rim which surprised me, I expected something more like 0.002 inch. Changing the sanding disks is time-consuming. The stock disk is 60 grit, too coarse for my work. It took me an hour to change it.  This is because the stock disk leaves all its glue residue on the platter, which is very hard to clean off. I used acetone and steel wool. The platter is smaller than standard so I had to trim the new disk so it would work at all. The angle gauge is very cheesy, it is fixed at 2 points and bows off its mounting surface in between. Despite these problems, I was able to get my job done nicely with this tool. It runs real quiet, is very powerful, and basically user-friendly. The precision table and large size are nice. The 45 degree position stop is not very ""crisp"" but may improve with use. The tool is greatly enhanced with the Delta 34-779 mitre gauge, available separately.  No mitre gauge was included. All in all, it's a good tool but obviously a tool made in China to meet a price target.",4.0
"An interesting and very useful addition to my studio. If there were half stars, I would rate this machine as a 4 1/2. This sander with its large disk is a godsend for truing angles for assembled pieces. My major complaint is the adjustments for establishing the 90 and 45 degree stops. Delta has a good idea but it is a little difficult getting to the adjustments... not impossible, just awkward. The one negative aside, this is a very nice machine. It is incredibly quiet and well balanced. The dust control system is well thought out. One unique function is the inclusion of a ""braking"" system for stopping the sander... it actually works! I am pretty sensitive to quality and value and this machine is a winner.",4.0
"I was impressed with the overall quality of this little sander.  It's very heavy, with over 90% of it being cast iron (just the switch, the brake lever and the dust collection chute are sturdy plastic). The disc's brake is very nice - stopping the disc in less than 1.5 seconds; otherwise it takes 2.5 minutes for the disc to stop on its own.  The motor is smooth and quiet, with a hint of vibration. The machining of the table is typical Delta - not perfect, but functionally OK.  It's ruler flat lengthwise, but it's not perfectly flat across the table (shortways).  Mine has a 0.005"" dip near the disc face and a 0.002"" dip just inside the miter gauge slot. A standard table saw miter gauge fits nicely into the slot, with no interference with the disc.  The table's trunnion machining is a bit rough and stiff, but it works.  The levers are the ""L"" shaped metal ratcheting type, and clearance is a bit tight. Consider replacing them with star knobs if you plan on frequent table tilting.  There's a 90 and 45 degree stop, which needed adjusting OOTB. I haven't run anything against it yet (I plan on using it for metalworking and some woodworking), but the motor should be plenty strong - as long as the work's not jammed against the disc.  Haven't tried the dust collection so can't comment.
Overall impression is that of economical quality. This should last a long time, and it offers a lot (see the pictures for the tilting range). Would have given it 5 stars except for the cramped knobs, the stiff table tilting, the slight vibration and the mildly crowned table.  I give it 4+ stars instead, since none of these are serious detractions that impede its use.",4.0
I have one of these sanders.  I think it works great.  Very solid and sturdy as weel as smooth operation (no vibration),4.0
Nice unit but I found myself just using towels first then using the buffer so the bonnet wouldn't get clogged up.  This is the best one on the market.  People said it would be too heavy but I didn't find that to be the case and I have a 38-foot express cruiser and used a step ladder.,4.0
"Because I think I need these things.  I've been a trim carpenter for only 25 years and I'm always looking for ways to make the job easier, faster, and turn out better.

If so I'll use his idea with the extensions.",4.0

"..who's only weak link is it's cord. I have owned mine for 2 years now and when I do use it, I'm usually drilling long pilot holes with auger bits, or using large self feed bits (1 1/2"" or 2""). I have used it the past week to drill out mortises for timbers joining into large log posts. As you may have noticed from the other reviews, this drill has power to spare and if you don't hold on tight it will twist right out of your hand. I HIGHLY recommend using the grip attachment when drilling with self feed bits or when drilling into microlams. Anyhow, I have had this drill twist out of my hand and fall 10 feet more times than I care to recall. Well, this week it twisted out and fell over 30 feet to the ground. I climbed down to go get it, half expecting to see it broken. When I picked it up, one of the housing screws was out about 1/4"" and a seal was protuding from a seam in the housing. I tightened the screw, climbed back up to try her out again on the log and, IT WORKED! Kept right on driving that 2"" self feed bit like it had before. I am impressed! The one draw back is that I am on my third cord. I have yet to cut one, but if the twistlok portion gets slammed enough times, it will not work. At least it is a simple fix, twist off the old cord and replace it with a new one in seconds. The premier feature of this drill has to be the trigger. It is SO sensitive to subtle changes in pressure, which makes precision work much easier. An excellent tool that will not let you down.",4.0
"It is remarkable how cheaply made, but dearly priced DeWalt tool accessories are. This is another example. Just a bunch of fittings and a couple of stamped steel guides. They even managed to screw up the DeWalt label stuck to the face of the guides. One was wrinkled and would have prevented reliable operation. Had to pull it off and clean off the adhesive residue wih solvent.

Having said that, this thing does work. In fact, it even works, with a little grinding down of two tabs, on an older Sears Craftsman cast iron base 10"" compound mitre saw. And that was a lucky break for me because you cannot get the Craftsman part anymore.

Makes cutting small to medium sizecrown moldings accurately possable.

Looked at the Bench Dog product that costs a little more, but it eats into your capacity.

I don't argue with the design of the DeWalt product, just wish it looked like a $25 product and not a $15 one.",4.0
"The only reason I gave this product four stars is the price. Other than that, it is a very useful accessory. I've been installing Crown Molding for a long time and these stops have increased my speed significantly. If you are going to use these only once, I would not recommend spending the money, but if you are a professional, these stops will pay themselves off within the first couple jobs.",4.0
I purchased this to help revive a paint job. This thing worked great . I wish that it came with a bonnet is my only complaint. If you look carefully there is one with a bag and two bonnets. I would buy that one just because you can go straight to work. No fault of the unit the picture is just deceitful. If it came with a hook and loop bonnet i would give it 5 stars.,4.0

I have had this drill for about a year.  It is extremely smooth and powerful; rpms high enough to use grinding stones and brushes (much more effective than on cordless drills).

"Obviously, I wanted a drill that would be able to get into tight places for various types of assembly and remodeling. For this it works quite well. I feel it is a better choice for all purpose drilling at odd angles than a right angle drill which tends to hit framing, duct, plumbing . .. . unless you are at or close to that right angle. When attempting to align the drill for a hole that is reasonably perpindicular to the surface, can be a little tough to guage, but for me the flexibility of the 55 degree head outweighs that benefit of a dedicated right angle drill. The paddle type switch works quite well,sometimes too well as it can be easily turned on because of the way your hand wraps around the housing and switch. It won't take long to figure out different hand positions to avoid that. The reversing switch is a bit awkward to reach while drilling, but in tight quarters once you have twisted your hands and arms to reach that tight spot, it is nice not to have to worry about inadvertantly hitting the swith to change directions; however, that being said, it works against you when you need to reverse the drill and have to back out of that tight spot or manuever your other  arm to the drill to switch directions. The keyed chuck works well, and the drill is basically comfortable and very useful. As for the reversing switch, I have not yet thought of a better location or type, but time may solve this minor gripe. Nonetheless, this is a typical Milwaukee product so far, it is well made, has a durable chasis and will probably run forever. I bought the steel carrying case to hold various auger and forstener bits which I tend to use a fair amount with this drill, the removable tray and the extra space of this box is very handy to grab and get to work, without having to pack up each time you use this drill. Nice tool to have around when the neighbors aren't asking for it.",4.0
"This drill is great, small enough to get in that tight places (Especially if you get the kit vs. the drill only) tuff enough to torque a #12 x 3"". The battery is not as long lasting as a full sized drill, but part of being small is ya loose something.
  I work on computers with this drill (as a hobby) and am a master plumber (professionally). In both jobs this tool shines. But if you are looking for some thing that is about the same size and is a little tougher and has a longer battery life go with the Panasonic ey6225c... both are made by Panasonic (The Milwaukee 6546 is made by Panasonic and is the same as ey503) but, the 6225 is just a little beefier.",4.0
"this is a nice lightweight little saw.  i had a makita just like it for many years that was a lot heavier.  if my husband hadn't dropped it, i would still be using that one.  i just hope that this one is as dependable as my old one!",4.0
"Its been really good to me. One caveat is that I purchased a laser to go with it, and without the laser, I would have rated this at least one star lower because it'd be really difficult to gauge where the cuts will fall. But the laser turns this mitering saw into one sawing beast. Highly recommended.",4.0
"I have owned this saw for 12 years. It is a work horse. It is lightweight and has plenty of power. The motor has never needed service, not even brush replacement. We use this saw often and for prolonged periods of repetitive cutting at times and it always delivers good results . That being said there are a few things you should know. First and foremost, this saw will not deliver hyper precise cuts required in fine custom cabinetry fabrication. The actual rotating table will have minor deflection to the side bearing more weight and your miters will not be 100 % perfect. This is particularly true in large, heavy hardwoods and exotics. Secondly, the bevel adjustment handle is plastic and if overtightened will strip. Lastly, the bevel scale is hard to see and lacks positive stops for common settings used in crown molding, etc.
Overall, this is a fantastic saw for the price and its longevity. I would recommend it to anyone, contractor or DIYer alike but  this  is not the saw I would use for complex millwork fabrication or installation",4.0
"I don't know what to say about this tool that hasent been said already. It is of very good quality and powerful as well. If you look around at other drills I doubt you will find anything that even comes close to this tool. The chuck is top notch,In my opinion one of the finest made. The level mounted in the drill body is a great idea,it really works well. On the down side I wish the body had a rubber grip like the cordless model and putting it away in the kit box puts a weird tweek in the cord and can be tough to do in a hurry. other than that this item should be in you tool box or shop as of yesterday. A real winner. now get out there and drill something..",4.0
"The DeWalt DW106 is a good drill for some applications.  It is a lightweight, high rpm, dependable tool.  It does have it's limitations, though.  If you plan to do much drilling in steel or other hard substances,  this may not be the right tool.  It will heat up fairly quickly and just  doesn't have the torque needed for the heavy duty jobs.  If you do a lot of  hole-drilling or screw-driving in softwoods, the light weight of this tool  makes it ideal.  If you want to buy only one drill for a wider range of  applications, without going to a 1/2"" drill, the DW222 might be a  better choice.  It has 6.7 amps instead of 5.4 amps, which makes a  significant difference.  It still has 1500 rpm, which isn't all that slow,  and the torque is unbelievable.  The price is also significantly higher,  but you get what you pay for.",4.0
"I purchased this mortiser about 5 months ago, and have been very happy with it. I purchased the higher quality Delta Austrian Mortising Bits locally, thinking that the imported bits that came with the machine wouldn't perform well, but the bits that came with the machine held up better. I broke 2 of the higher quality bits (1/4"") in oak, but the cheaper ones are still going. I had one bolt that I could not install when I put the machine together, but Delta sent me a replacement in a day. The machine has better than average construction, and I think it is a good value for the money. I have cut over 100 1/4 inch mortises with no problem. My fence does sit a little tilted (horizontally)but it does not affect its operation, and everything that affects the precision of cuts lines up well. The machine has good power, I use it mostly on oak and cherry, and have no problems. Common sense dictates that the larger the mortise you are boring, the slower you go. I can cut into oak with a 1/4"" bit quite fast, but slow my feed rate down when using larger bits. Don't try to use it without bolting or clamping it down. Considering the bits that it comes with, I think it is an excellent value. It has saved me a lot of time cleaning out mortises that I used to make with round bits. There may be higher quality machines out there, but not for this kind of money. The fact that Delta / Porter Cable stand behind their products was a factor in selecting this unit.",4.0

"A while back following a major wallet-emptying experience buying new windows for my house I decided to save money by recycling the 60 year old case molding.  Having admired from afar the Porter Cable 9444 I finally  felt justified in purchasing one.  It was the right thing to do.  This  machine with it's 1.8 amp motor has the power to remove material  surprisingly fast in small places while giving you excellent control.  Despite the seemingly small footprint of the sanding pad and the  accessories, this machine cut far faster than I had hoped for.  Over 640'  of molding that had been badly re-painted several times came clean quickly.  There was always a profile head that matched a particular nook or cranny.  Originally, I had thought to use the 9444 only to do the grooves and tight  places, but I found it fast enough to do the faces and edges of the molding  as well - it was easier (and safer for the molding) than getting out the  belt sander. When you use this machine your hand circles the entire motor.  This is not a perfect feeling and I found myself having to stop at times to  rest my hand.  However there was far less vibration transferred to your  hand that I expected.  Porter Cable seems to think that you will never  need a place to store extra sandpaper in the ubiquitous molded plastic case  - there is a place for everything that comes with the purchase but nothing  extra.  When will toolmakers realize that they are missing a free  marketing-moment by this sort of shortsighted design?  I consider these  gripes somewhat minor compared to the overall excellence of the machine. If  you only have occasional tight-place sanding to do, there is probably a  less expensive rodent-like solution out there.  But if you have a seriously  large project to do or are in the trades you can't go wrong with this  machine.",4.0

This saw will do everything from medium size framing jobs to cabinetry work and moulding installations.  It is a good addition to any shop.,4.0
"I always wanted a belt sander but never had an actual need until I started a shop workbench consisting of a 2x4 laminated top.  Once everything was glued and dried, I pulled her out of the box, attached the dust bag and adjusted the belt tracking on medium course sanding belt and let it rip on high speed.  I was pleased at what quick work the sander made of smoothing the laminated top.  Only light pressure was required for the sander to do its work.  The sander fit comfortably in my hands with very little vibration.  The dust bag was able to capture some of the dust being generated but just as much went airborne.  I guess this is to be expected with any belt sander though.  The variable speed came into play when I need to smooth some uneven edges on the cabinet carcass.  By dialing the unit down to a medium-low setting I was able to control the amount of material being removed safely.

"This is a great little sander.  Gutsy and does what it's supposed to do.  The belt tracks well with only occasional adjustments  It does have a stream of air that comes out of the motor (for cooling) that tends to hit you in the face and you need to keep clear of that when sanding or after a few minutes your eyes get a lot of very fine dust in them.  I've heard some reviewers complain about heat build-up on the belt, but they might be putting too much pressure on the sander or have cheaper belt.

My complaint is the dust collection bag.  Almost seems like a 3rd party manufacturer for just the bag.  Main issue with it is the zipper.  Right out of the box, the little pull tab on the slider body part was missing.  I use a pliers to open the zipper and then it's still hard to do.  The zipper has very little ""clearance"" between the teeth and the slider body so it gets gummed up pretty easily with sawdust (which it should be designed to deal with).

Dust ""collection"" is also loosely implied.  It does capture a good deal of sawdust, but invariably, you'll have plenty of dust floating around you too, unless you can hook the unit up to a vacuum system.  Not a complaint, as I expected that.

Another plus is that it will lay flat on it's side (the drive belt side) meaning you could build a jig to hold it in place and use the belt in a vertical, stationary position, if that makes sense.",4.0

"I purchased this sander to sand my decks and it worked great!!  I wanted a work horse tool and I think I have one.  With about 12 hours on the motor I cannot pick up on any abnormal sounds.  I may be too critical here but I am giving the sander 4 stars because of the dust collection system.  I think one reason why the bag does not collect as much dust as it could is because the bag's wire attachment fixture does not seal the bag around the port so dust blows out of a small hole.  With that in mind, wearing a well-fitting dust mask is a must for the operator and those who may in the immediate area.  And yes, it is noisy so I strongly advise wearing hearing protection.

I liked:
 - the heavy weight of the tool simply requires the operator to steer the sander over the work surface.
 - quality feel of the sander during operation.  I did not notice any vibration in my hands.
 - the motor was strong and when I applied gentle pressure to the work surface it did not bog down.
 - excellent belt tracking.  I only make fine adjustments after replacing the belt.
 - even sanding over the work surface.  I could not detect any high or low spots on the sander.
 - quick belt changes.

I would like:
 - a better dust management system.  I will not use this sander inside the shop.  Also, I am left handed so my tendency is to drive the sander with my left hand.  With the sander at full power in my left hand It only took a few seconds to receive a face full of dust due to the ""blow by"" resulting from the poor fitting dust bag.  That said, the sander is balanced so well, using my right hand with this tool is not a problem.
 - more space between the drive wheel and the wheel housing.  I am a rookie with belt sanders and was not managing the position of my power cord properly. About an hour into my project I snagged the power cord and wrapped the cord around the drive wheel of the sander.  I was able to get the cord free of the drive wheel without damaging anything but with extreme difficulty.  I now operate the tool with the power cord over my shoulder in order to keep the cord above the sander and off the work surface.  I also keep the extension cord behind me and away from the sander at all times.

All in all it is an excellent tool.  I would buy it again and strongly recommend the sander to others.",4.0

I made a quick shield and will see how it works ..it should be fine and no reason the MFG should not have one... next I bought this unit so I could get close to the wall edge however when the bag starts filling up it limits how close you can get to the wall... so then if you want to switch or rotate the bag around to the other side of the handle  and this would work .. however then the bag retention clips scrap the wall... so going to have to re-work the bang attachment somehow.... other than these two issue has lots of power and seems heavy duty so as I have had other porta product which have performed well,,, I will probably keep it if the debris issue is now fixed with my add on shield..",4.0

The construction of the DeWalt DW160 right angle drill is surprisingly good being that the enclosure is all plastic. The drill trigger is ruff cast aluminum and sized for someone with a certain size hand. The drill is  made for right hand users and can not be converted to lefty.  The trigger  design could be improved upon by removing the bar that runs from the top to  the bottom of the drill to allow you to grip the drill fully and not end up  inadvertently turning it on. The weight of the drill is very good and the  compactness is exceptional. It would have been better if this drill was  available with a keyless chuck. The drill motor is very quite and supplies  smooth operation but does not have variable speed. The power it provides  for drilling through floor joists is more than adequate.,4.0

"There's nothing spectacular about this work light, it works as well as other 18-volt xenon bulb work-lights on the market.

"After working on a few projects in the basement shop, dust became a problem.  It was a big problem, since I share the space with the laundry, and home gym.  I was given the ultimatum; control the dust, or stop the work.
Needless to say, I started looking for dust collectors.  I decided to go with this unit for size considerations.  Since I am just one person, I decided that I could move the hose from machine to machine.  This has proved to be more of a pain than I anticipated, so you may want to consider a more powerful machine if you plan on installing permenent ductwork.
I must say though, that the unit has performed its function, and dust is not nearly the problem it used to be.  I can't say the basement is dustless, so I might see an air cleaner in my future.",4.0
"Was terribly disappointed at first - A clip fell out on the belt's first rotation. After an hour take-apart, the clip was back in place, and I set out to strip old paint off of a window. I was very impressed. This little unit had some claw, but not too much that I wouldn't use it for some pretty fine work. Held it aloft for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, and never felt the weight. Also didn't see any sawdust because it was all in the bag! The plastic case could be stronger, but then there would have to be other compromises, like weight or price. This sander strikes a fantastic balance for the do-it-yourselver.",4.0
"I am quite pleased with how fast I was able to take dark stain off of kitchen cabinets that I am refinishing.  This is a very good machine and quieter than others I have used.  The dust collection bag is THE BEST!  Very easy belt changing mechanism.  I felt it was a little bit hard to control when it was on the top speed.  Other than that, a really good belt sander!",4.0
"Like any other sander there is always a belt issue, but after messing around with the adjustment the belt finally stayed on track with little movement.  Would not recommend for big projects but for small ones, I highly recommend it.",4.0
"I purchased one of these locally. Looking here I see that many people say that dust collector does not work. That is not actually true. There is a design problem, however, because the channels through which dust travel can clog up. The first time this happened I took off the side plate and cleaned out the packed-in sawdust. It worked well for a while after that, and then it stopped. I took the side off again, but this time the dust collection was not improved. I decided that there had to be a plug somewhere else where I could not see it. So, while the sander was working, I used my small shop vacuum first to blow air in through the dust output, and to blow air everywhere possible. Then I vacuumed from the dust output port and also around all the edges and corners of the machine while it was running. Afterwards, the unit once again picked up almost all the sawdust it created. I did not need to disassemble it.

Remember to empty the dust collection sack before it gets full. If it stops picking up dust then use a shop vacuum to push and then pull sawdust through the narrow interior channels.

The design is bad, but not fatally bad.

The unit sands extremely well. The ceramic ""sandpaper"" is excellent.",4.0
"Not much to say it does what it is suppose to do. 18v rechargeable. I like the fact that it will set on its base(the battery),adjusts to any angle and not tip over. I am a general contractor so I keep my battery's on an inverter in the cab of my truck, so I have one ready for a job. This was a nice addition to my complete set of Milwaukee 18v tools, Its not LED but that's OK cause battery life is not an issue,",4.0
Excellent flash light!  Very bright!  It was an extra that came with the set but I'm happy to have it.  Nice to know it's there when you need a good flash light,4.0
This collector does a fine job. It has great power and makes little noise. I ran hundreds of feet of hose and bought all kinds of blast gates and attachments for everything I could think of. It works but only for one tool at a time. I guess I'm trying to do too much with it. It will run all day without a complaint. I bought a remote start for it though . I think it's a good thing to have. If you have a small shop you can't beat this unit. It has a little more power than some of the others in this price range.,4.0
"I am retiring soon and have been slowly adding tools for my workshop. This dust collection system should be a priority for anyone who enjoys woodworking. It is very efficient and surprisingly quiet! I have utilized blast gates, etc. to hook it up to my band saw and table saw. Works great. Was easy to assemble aside from the metal bands which were shipped incorrectly assembled and I had to fiqure out the spring latch system. Once corrected they work well. Even my wife likes it as the sawdust now has been significantly reduced thus making the workshop a cleaner and healthier environment. A must buy!",4.0
"I've just recently bought this item and have had the opportunity to give it a good try. I've owned only one belt sander before, same size as this one, and it was a Craftsman. Compared to the Craftsman this is a Cadillac. HOWEVER, the dust collecter part works but not well. It fills the shop with dust in seconds. The Craftsman never did that. Perhaps because its removing so much wood. At this point though, I would buy another one.",4.0
"nice and solid to keep it from wandering too much. feels like it should last a while. i use mine only occasionally so i can't speak to its longevity. variable speed is a nice feature. before this, i had only used my dad's old black and decker....needless to say this one blows that one away!",4.0
"I had a super DeWalt 3x21 for a decade of weekend warrior, but decided to try Porter this time.  I have a mix of both in my tool chest, so far always satisfied.  I can't compare a decade of DeWalt to a few weeks of Porter-Cable, but so far I like the new tool.  It seems very powerful when I dig in, well balanced so responds like I want.  Unlike another reviewer, I found using it on ""slow"" is useful, and very quiet.  I put on ""fast"" for a big flat slab, but ""slow"" for anything else.  It isn't clear if DeWalt or Porter dust collection is better, and I'm not sure if I like the smaller DeWalt or larger Porter bag.  I like the open front of the Porter.  It seems like the belt on the Porter wanders a bit less than the DeWalt under non-flat uses (tipping back or forward, cleaning up an edge of something).  Tracking is good on either.",4.0
"you could turn the thing upside down to make quick adjustments to small pieces of wood, it would be near perfect. It's a great combination of size/wieght/price/performance, but it won't sit upside down without building a jig/stand to hold it.

In most instances, this is not an issue. But when it is, it's a fairly annoying design flaw.",4.0
I Purchased this sander about 5 years ago.  It finally died after dropping it several times and sanding numerous projects.  I can't believe it lasted as long as it did.  I replaced it with a cheaper craftsman and it does the job but not nearly as superior as the porter cable.  I have never been dissatisfied with any porter cable tool I have had especially not this one. 4 stars because of the high pitched noise it creates but that's the only reason.,4.0
"I love this thing. Very bright. Pivoting head is better than the dewalt version. Will shine all day with a fresh battery. Only fault....NO Belt clip. The clip should come with it, as a gift, for choosing milwaukee over dewalt. Other than that it's a great buy.",4.0
"This light works good, but I was a little dissappointed in the ""belt-clip"" that was supposed to ""conveniently hook"" to my belt.  The one I received won't clip to anything, and near as I can figure, you need another part of the ""system"" to attach to your belt for it to work.  Now I'll have to find that part or else jury-rig something...",4.0
"I don't often use a belt sander, generally preferring a planer for heavy material removal, but I picked this one up anyway thinking it might come in handy for some renovation project.  These are my admittedly novice impressions of this tool:

- A bit difficult to control

- Prone to unintentional ""sanding"" of objects (e.g., the power cord)

- Very, very loud (a high pitched scream)

I don't really understand the last one, as my stationary sander is a relatively quiet tool.

Needless to say, I have ended up not using this tool as much as I had hoped, but if you have the right application for it, it's probably worthwhile.  I generally have the highest regard for PC tools, and this has done everything it claims, and is relatively easy to adjust and change belts.

The most memorial moment I've had with this tool was plugging it in once with the switch turned on. GO TOOL GO, TILL YOU RUN OUT OF CORD!!",4.0
"I picked one of these up in exchange for a DeWalt that died after a half hour of use.  So far it lasted the afternoon.  I used it to sand a workbench top.

"I've owned/used several belt sanders over the last couple of years.  This is one of the best.  Powerful, somewhat heavy but well balanced. Because it is somewhat heavy and powerful, I save this for the tough wood, like oak or cocobolo.  (I have a Bosch with a sanding frame that is awesome for finish or delicate work.) The motor does run hot, as another reviewer noted.  The dust collection bag works darn well for what it is.",4.0
"Great sander, ample power, belt changes and tracking adjustments are a snap.  However, one time during use, I inadvertently let the power cord get too close to the drive wheel.  The tool sucked the cord up, wedging the cord between the sanding belt and the tool housing, and grinding the motor to a halt.  The cord was easily repaired, but the drive belt (which connects the motor to the drive wheel) was shot and needed to be replaced.  The moral of the story is to keep a close eye on the cord, and keep it away from the drive wheel at all times.  Other than that, the tool has performed flawlessly.",4.0
"I used the 352VS to sand a very large deck (45' X 18'), and it performed well.  Here are my observations:
Positives:
 - the sander is well-balanced and well-weighted.  I did not have to apply too much pressure unless I wanted to get down deep.
 - changing belts was easy, and using the adjustment control was equally easy.
 - the handles are well-positioned and ergonomically designed.
 - overall performance was consistent and even.
Negatives:
 - the dust bag was often in the way, regardless of the its ability to be swivelled.  Additionally, it captured only a small portion of the overall dust.
 - it is quite noisy.
 - while its metal casing adds durability and structural strength, it became extremely hot during use.  I burned my wrist on it more than once.
 - it was difficult to handle and maneuver in small, cramped spaces.
 - the design of the top of the sander prevents it from being turned over and used as a stationary, counter-top unit.
Overall, I think its price here on amazon.com makes it a good buy.",4.0
"I have spent the last year working on my house, sanding the outside and building a deck in the backyard.  This sander has worked great for me.  The belt rides very smooth and is easy to change.
I have only had one problem with the sander, other than running over the belt which really has more to do with user error.  When I have used the sander with very coarse paper, 60 grit, I find that the pathway to the dust bag becomes clogged very easily.  It appears that it just gets overloaded with material.  Cleaning this out is a fairly involved operation.  Almost the entire housing assembly has to be taken apart to clean it out.
On the positive side the weight of this sander is not so great that you can't sand vertical surfaces.  It worked great on the redwood panels of my house.
I would highly recommend this sander for someone who needs a belt sander for home improvement projects.  The construction is very sturdy and I expect to get years of service from it.",4.0
this base does NOT fit the 36-L552.  But if you can modify it to fit by welding extensions off the end of it without modifying your saw.  The base does work great once its fitted to the machine.,4.0
"Just another favorable review of one of my favorite power tools...
The  weight is right, the handle angle is right, plenty of power, and it works  every time.  I bought this saw to replace a cheap DIY-special Black and  Decker and the difference was a revelation (of course, any  professional-quality tool would have been a revelation).
The saw has  lived in indignity under my side bench for years, getting hauled out for a  variety of tasks.  I am a woodworker hobbyist and amateur household  carpenter.  I use this saw for the occasional garden shed, rough-cutting  sheet goods,  and to make sets and furniture for theatrical productions (I  married an actress).  In my light-duty work the saw is a marvel.
I cannot  speak to its suitability for a professional framer, but it works great for  me.
As a side note, I kind of lust after the left-bladed Porter-Cable,  but I worry about safety.  Is a left-handed blade more dangerous for a  right-handed woodworker?  You can see the blade more easily, which sounds  good to me, but it would put the blade much closer to my left hand (i.e.,  my movable clamp).  Just a question for thought...",4.0
"During a four year period a few years back I was part of a three man framing crew.  We framed over a hundred homes and during this time we used a variety of tools in all types of weather conditions.  The most reliable  saw on the job site was my makita.  During this time period the saws were  dropped (accidentaly), cords were cut, got rained on, were exposed to  subzero temperatures and snow, extreme sun and heat, and were generally  beat to death. (These conditions are tough on a body, too.  Ever meet a  retired framer?)  I can't imagine a more thorough test to put a tool  through than a rough-framing job site.  And of all the brands we went  through, makita came out on top.  The toughest, most durable saw for the  money.  Lightweight (somewhat) and easy to cut with.  The handle is low,  compared to a DeWalt or Milwaukee where you feel as if you push too hard,  the rear of the saw will lift off the workpiece.  And as always, use a  quality blade in ANY tool and don't rush the cut and labor the motor.  Let  the blade do the work.",4.0
These are okay and cut cleanly.  I find the Freud's or Foresters cut faster,4.0
This a great addition to the Delta Tablesaw. Works very well on smooth surfaces. My saw had a Biesemier fence and required relocating the two extension table legs inward to match the narrower footprint of the extended base.,4.0
"I recently moved to a new house.  This presented a problem since we now have a two car garage, and my previous shop was a 25'x25' space.  I now have to share roughly the same space with a car also.  The answer?  Either sell my Unisaw (not gonna happen, no sir!) or get a mobile base and compact my tools together via mobile bases when not using them.  So I bought this mobile base and extension, got about four friends to help lift my saw, and like magic I am mobile!
There are a couple issues, which is why I give four stars and not five:
1) If you are not on perfectly flat ground, you will have to offer a little ""persuasion"" to tote the saw around.  The rubber floor supports drag on the ground.
2) For my particular saw, I had to move the legs at the end of the table in toward center so that they would fit in the extension.  Not a big deal, just had move the supports and screw them in.
All in all I am very satisfied with this.  To move a 500 lb saw like it is almost nothing is worth every penny.  I now have almost all my tools on mobile bases, and will never regret making the purchase.
Thanks, I hope this helps!",4.0

"Bought the blade about 6 months ago for my Rockwell 10"" Contractor Saw. Works great on hard and soft woods. Does a good job on 3/4 Oak veneer plywood. For the price you get a good quality carbide blade that will stay  sharp if your a ""weekend"" woodworker",4.0
All reviewers - could you please post some pictures of your saw and the mobile base? Would help a lot to see how it all fits in.,4.0
"I have an older Delta / Rockwell Unisaw and it weighs too much to try to move without some kind of wheels.  The product was long overdue to buy.  The mobile base was simple and quick to put together.

If you too have an older unisaw, I want to point out a few problems I ran into, just in case you have the same issues.  On the lower base of the saw, there is an opening for a dust port.  When you install the saw onto the mobile base, this port is no longer available to use.  The back of the base covers up about half the opening.  I had to make a cover and seal it up.  Then I had to cut a new hole higher on the saw and create a additional opening for the 4"" dust hose.

The 2nd problem was the middle push down for raising the wheel.  The angle in which the handle was welded was high and hit the oak shelf I had on the bottom of my saw.  So again, I had to make a modification.  I had to take the shelf off and cut it, so there was room for the handle to come up and totally lower the wheel.  It was just another little annoyance for a simple mobile base.

I have moved the saw around the shop using the new base and it is pretty easy to use.

This is one of those accessories that I waited too long to purchase.  Great product to help make another tool mobile in my shop.",4.0
"This base fits my Unisaw with a 52"" Unifence just right.  I am using the steel base that came with the saw.  The saw base fits right into the mobile base frame.  The frame is low to the ground, so you need a relatively smooth surface.  I had considered the heavy duty Grizzly base, but for about the same cost I decided on the Delta base because of the nice design, and the fact it was built for the Delta saw.  You need to think about the manual lever lift with the lower shelf.  My base came with two lever options for the center wheel lift.",4.0
"I purchased the mobile base for my Jet cabinet saw. It was very easy to put together and is very solidly constructed. The saw when on the base doesn't move that easily, but is moveable, probably because the floor of my workshop isn't completely flat and has fairly roughly textured concrete and the saw is very heavy.

I'm not sure if it would help to have larger wheels on the base for rougher surfaces....possibly.",4.0
"This base sure makes moving my Unisaw around a heck of a lot easier. I do find that the pivoting wheel tends to slide from it's locking plate, hence 4 out of 5 stars",4.0

"I've had this drill for the last 3 or 4 years and it's gotten me out of a few pinches where a standard drill couldn't fit, in fact, that's why I originally bought it.  I'd say I've only given it light duty use, as I'm just your average DIYer, and have other drills that I find easier and more handy to use.  Having said that, the construction appears to be robust and well made with one flaw it it's design... The paddle operated trigger could be dangerous if you're not paying attention.  As one reviewer mentioned, if you set this drill down plugged in, it could trip the paddle.  No way would you want to hang or place this drill on your body with it plugged in as it doesn't have a safety switch.  I have also accidentally bumped the paddle while working in confined spaces between studs (again, where you're likely to need a right angle drill).  A traditional trigger would have made this a much better product. The actual button that the paddle operates is located towards the rear of the unit (good placement), so there's no real reason I can tell for the paddle.  I've seriously thought about removing or cutting down the paddle as it would be both easier to use a safer without it.

I decided to write this review (my first) because of all the reviews below that mention the unit doesn't have a reverse.  I'm not sure if they have a different model, older version, or just missed it, but my DW160V certainly does have a reverse on it.  It's a toggle switch located at the base of the drill marked REV and FWD.

All in all, I think this is a good specialty drill, but one you have to pay some attention to when using.  It looks like it's well constructed and should last me in my limited DIYer home use many decades (hopefully).",4.0
We like the drill but the way the switch works takes some getting used to (the silver part is the on/off switch). It is very easy to turn on by mistake.,4.0
"I wish it had a quick change chuck of some sort. Other than that, I like it. Has plenty of power.",4.0
"I have only recently put this product into service so my review is based on limited service time.  The base seems to be substantially built and sturdy.  Assembly was basic.  Can't think of anything much I would change.  I had assumed that since the base was for a machine with a 56"" extension, that the legs would have been included but they were not.  I purchased them separately and it seems to perform just fine for my purposes.",4.0
"Excellent quality, easy to assembly, feel secure when moving saw,  and easy to raise and lower. The only drawback is manuverablity. Turning radius is large for my small shop (16x16) and requires some work to get saw where you want it.",4.0
"If you own a Unisaw in a small shop, you need this mobile base. Very easy to assemble, seems very sturdy. Nice finish-seems to be powder coated.

It makes moving this machine easy, although somewhat awkward,until you get used to ""driving"" it. I will be buying a similar base for my Delta 14"" bandsaw also.",4.0
The blade cuts good in wood and plywood.  It does some chipping on crosscutting plywood.,4.0
It does as it is intended,4.0
"I dropped one (of the pair) of these on the outside of my blade on a Ridgid 10"" TS3650. When I raised the blade it cut 1/16"" of an inch to the left on my zero-clearance insert.

I found that because of the diameter of the stabilizer disc and the slight recess on the inside, when I tightened down the blade nut it had slightly cupped the blade causing it to cut inside just a touch. (Now my insert is no longer zero clearance ... time for a new insert).

The fix was to flip the stabilizer around so that the recess is away from the blade (nut-side). When tightened now there is no cupping of the blade.

Using both stabilizers (one on each side of the blade) would have prevented this problem too ... but would still have necessitated a new zero-clearance insert.

Otherwise, the stabilizer is fine. I notice spin-down taking longer now -- more mass, more inertia.",4.0
"I mainly purchased these to replace the standard thrust washer that came with my tablesaw. So with that in mind, they work great.  As for the stabilizer part, I don't think they add much for standard kerf blades, or at least I don't notice any  appreciable difference.  I don't use thin kerf blades as a general rule so I can't speak to their usefulness while using thin kerf blades.

I hadn't really intended on using both pieces when I ordered them, again intended to replace the thrust washer. One added benefit that I didn't think about is that it shifts the blade over, in my case, to the right.  Now I can reuse some of my old chewed up zero clearance inserts!

I do only use the outside stabilizer with my dado set.",4.0

I could not find this information anywhere in the description.  I took a chance and it works very well.  I bought this primarly to move the blade slightly to the right so I would not have to disassemble my saw to move the entire assemly to the right.  This was required to mount the blade guard.

This is a new saw from Grizzly and when assembled, the blade and guard would not line up.  They have a procedure to move the blade to the right but would require removing the table and wings.  I did not want to do that.

So, in my case, this stabilizer solved my problem.",4.0

"This is a nice item to use in concert with larger diameter blades, especially when working with thicker material.  For me, it is worth the money.",4.0
"This product made a big difference when working with a benchtop saw.  Because these saws have a lot of vibration and are loud I noticed the difference in noise reduction as well as smoother cuts.  You do have to keep in mind that the added weight can place added stress on the motor which is a concern in underpowered saws.  Also, if you use both at the same time it moves the blade towards the right which might be a problem if you already have a sliding crosscut table or an already cut zero clearance insert.  I would recommend only using one on the right.",4.0
"The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that this screwdriver is a bit pricey and also a bit large for a 3.6V model.  But if you do a lot of electronic assembly or repair, this is the screwdriver for you.  This model has a 2 speed transmission with a surprising amount of torque in low gear and fast (600 RPM) in high gear.  The most important feature though is the electronic clutch.  You will not strip even the most delicate screws with this screwdriver.  If you are looking for an all purpose drill driver or you want something with lots of power, the DeWalt may be a better choice as it is cheaper and more powerful.  But if you need a screwdriver for delicate work that is fast, fairly powerful and won't strip out small screws, this is the only choice.  Normally, I say the more power the better but if you want a screwdriver with a precision clutch for delicate work, this is THE tool for you.

Toolman Joe",4.0
"I use this tool for electronics assembly, mostly computers. What sets this model apart from 98% of the rest is the electronic clutch. Unlike the mechanical clutches on other tools, its action does not vary based on how hard you push on the screw. That means you can achieve more reliable torque settings and can work on more delicate assemblies. Further more it doesn't make that awful ratcheting sound when the clutch engages. The Makita 6705DW also has electronic clutch, but its form is too large and its handle does not articulate into a pistol grip.
Sadly, this is the best lightweight inline cordless screwdriver I could find. To be perfect this tool needs five things. First, a carry case. None is included or available. Second, a modern battery. This tool uses nickel cadmium batteries, which are large (relatively) and suffer from memory effects. Any high performance cordless device should have nickel metal hydride or lithium ion batteries, which could make this tool smaller, lighter, and give improved battery life. Third, I want a screwdriver that has continuously variable speed like that is common on many cordless drills (but not screwdrivers).This tool is just on or off, in high or low gear. Fourth, and minor, it comes with only 2 philips head bits. Strangely, no slotted bits (or any other bits at all) are included. Fifth, it should have a compartment that would accommodate 1 or 2 bits on board the tool like many cordless drills do.
This tool is the best available but it's not the tool I wanted to buy and was willing to pay for.",4.0
"I did a lot of looking around at medium right angle drills. The drawbacks on the Dewalt is no variable speed, and no reversing. So it may be prone to stripping screws, and now way to reverse them out when they do. Ouch. For straight drill of holes it is great.
If you have air around, and don't need to make large holes in 2x12s, the air driver Porter Cable is sweet. Has air pressure, to create torque and variable speed adjustments, and has reversing capabilities, and is the best price on the block.
My pick is the Makita 110 volt model. It has the largest amperage motor in the medium duty range, has variable speed, reversing, and an adjustable speed limiting dial, an LED light to illuminate your work, and is guaranteed to last the lifetime of the tool.
Next is the Bosch with a slightly weaker motor at 3.8 amps, and doesn't have the speed range of the Makita, even though it is at the same price. Nice overall tool though.
Then comes the Milwaukee 55 degree angle drill. Fine for additional leverage while drilling, but could be a problem for deeper access areas when making 90-degree applications. Especially important in crammed quarters, when you would have to swing the body out the additional 35 degrees to get a 90-degree angle.
Black and Decker makes a lightweight unit, and will suffice for the occasional weekend warrior.
The Dewalt unit, fills a niche, but is a very good example of getting what you pay for. If it were not for the no reversing, and no variable speed capabilities, and for making the paddle switch so long, that gets in the way, even when you don't want it to, makes the unit, strictly for those who are price conscious first, and tool conscious later.
Wake up and smell the Makita. :-)",4.0
"Bought this drill while I was rewiring several rooms in my house. Got it to drill through floor joists, and it did just that very well. Compact size with good power.
The handle/trigger is tricky, and I unplug it before changing bits or if I'm done using it for awhile. Otherwise you're likely to activate the drill accidentally. Did it once, luckily didn't get hurt.
But, the length of the trigger is good for one thing. With 2 x 10 joists, I was able to get the drill bit up into the upper part of the joist without having to stick my hand all the way up there. No keyless chuck, but that may be why it's compact. Keyless chucks are about 2-3 times as long as a keyed chuck, so for size issues, I don't mind it here.",4.0

The only problem I have  with this set is that they all look the same.  Can you tell the difference  between .008 and .012? I can.... with a micrometer. If you don't have one,  you will have trouble telling the shims apart. There are some other sets  that use color coding. These might be easier for some people to use. I like  the fact that there are extra shims of each thickness (particularly the  .004), since they could be damaged easily.",4.0
"This is a good quality blade and at a fair price. At 24t you get a decent cut. I haven't used mine on the job but,it has seen it's fair share of projects around my home shop, without complaints. I do recommend this blade, the quality is there and the price is right. As I do with all my blades I wipe them clean after use and spray on a light coat of( dri-cote) they won't rust and it reduces cutting friction. Now get out there and cut something.",4.0
"As an aspiring woodworker, I found the Delta mortising tool a useful addition to my collection.  Its best feature is definitely the price and the fact it utilizes your existing drill press.  However it does have some  limitations.
First is the depth of cut.  I have a Delta 12"" drill  press with 2.5 inches of travel.  The attachment method of the mortising  tool eats up about 1.5 inches of the total travel.  I was able to optimize  the mounting somewhat to achieve about 1.25"" of travel for the  1/2"" mortise.  The smaller bits are  shorter, so this might further  limit travel but I haven't tried them yet.  If you have a press with  3-4"" of travel, this probably wouldn't be an issue.
Bear in mind  there are two levels of mortising bits from Delta.  The set of four bits  included are the cheaper ones made in Taiwain, whereas the better ones made  in Austria are about $40 each.  To the novice they look similar, but the  experts insist you get what you pay for.  Personally I opted for the 4  included Taiwanese bits and then bought a single higher quality 1/2""  bit which I had an immediate use for.  I figure I will use the cheap bits  for now and if they break, I'll upgrade them later.
As for set up, it  can be very time consuming, especially the first time.  I ended up scribing  perpendicular cheater lines on my drill press table and support column to  assist in determining when the fence and  bit were square.  Because I was  making deep mortises, I had to raise my table several times in order to  achieve the desired depth of cut.  To facilitate maintaining the proper  table alignment, I used a C-clamp to lock the toothed rack in place on the  support column.  I also referenced the scribed lined on the column  described above.
Once set up was complete, I was able to make some nice  cuts in a reasonable amount of time.  I feel the mortising kit is well  worth the price, so long as you are aware of its limitations.",4.0
"For any aspiring, up and coming woodworker this is a great saw to start getting serious. Set up was easy and goes relatively quickly as everything is well explained. For those on the fence regarding the fence (sorry!) I would suggest taking the plunge for the extra cash. The eXacta fence system is unbelievable and so solid. I was also extremely impressed with the quietness of this saw. For those with basement shops and little ones sleeping upstairs this could save a lot of questions about what Daddy is doing! The cast wings really help keep it stable with little vibration; though my wings are slightly bowed it isn't enough to cause any problems. It does take up a large area with the added wings and extension table so if you have a relatively small space spring for the mobile base so it can be moved with ease as it is quite heavy.
Overall for the features, finish, and value I don't think you can beat this Jet tablesaw; beleive me I looked. I am looking for this saw to provide everything I need to do on a tablesaw even as my skill grows; from what I can tell so far I will have all that and more.",4.0
"I bought this saw a little over a year ago. Everything was set perfectly from the factory. Fair warning though, it does take some time to put together!
I've used to to cut oak, cherry, pine, hickory, etc. Heck, I've even ripped 3"" thick oak table legs with the blade that came with the saw and it never broke a sweat. With a little tweaking, the Jetfence actually works well too.
I gave it four stars for a couple of reasons. 1. I had to get Jet to send a new fence because the one that came with it was curved like a banana. To their credit, they sent one no questions asked. (Their service is EXCELLENT.) 2. The blade guard and splitter assembly is awkward and has to be removed to change the blade. I would prefer to use it for safety reasons, but it's just too much of a pain in the neck. Come on guys, redesign the thing! 3. I had to grind and file a notch in the plastic tab that marks the fence position to get it to read correctly. A small issue, but it would be easy for Jet to correct this without me having to get out the grinder. 4. The stock miter gauge has some minor play in it. It's not too bad, and I corrected it with a punch and hammer. Still, it wouldn't cost Jet much more to include a bar that is adjustable.
Don't let my picky little points fool you. The fact is, I had to search to find even small things wrong with this saw! This is one solid no-frills machine that performs well. It has done everything I have asked it to do without fail. I would definitely buy it again.",4.0

"Overall I'm satisfied with this saw for the price.  It does two things most circular saws can't: cuts a 60 degree bevel in 2x's, and cuts 6x's in 2 passes.  The power, stability, and lack of run-out/wobble in this saw make for very nice cuts.  It's a brute to handle, but so are 7 1/4"" worm saws.
Unfortunately, there are  two shortcomings that cost it a star.  First, there are no adjustment stops for the 0 and 45 degree bevel.  Second, the foot on mine is out of alignment with the blade by almost 1/8"", making it impossible to cut against a rip board.  I've used Skill circular saws for years so I'm not surprised - I just hoped they might have done better with this model. On the positive side, Skill stuck with a steel foot which doesn't scratch or drag on lumber and like aluminum does.  The only decent aluminum foot I've ever used was the nickle plated Hitachi (which appears to have been discontinued).  Wake up tool industry!  We have stainless clad aluminum cookware - why can't we get a stainless clad aluminum saw foot?",4.0
"First thing to know about this saw is despite what the other review says it will NOT cut a 4x4 in one pass! I was skeptical about his claim yet I bought it anyway because why would he lie? Maybe he just doesn't use the tools before he reviews them? Also this size saw has far less selection of blades in stock at most hardware stores and they cost more on average then the 7 1/4"" blades.
That is the bad. On the good side this saw just feels right when you use it. The power comes up smoothly when you pull the trigger and it just purs beautifully through the wood. Though I wouldn't want to work above my head with this saw all day because of it's weight, I used it for several minutes overhead without any real discomfort.
I will keep this saw but if I had it to do again I would get the Mag 77 and enjoy the lower initial price, graeter blade selection, and slightly lighter weight.",4.0

"I bought this particular drill for two reasons:
1: I really did want to support American labor and get a USA Product.
2: I needed a slighty heavier duty ""small hand drill"" size of drill.

The drill is a bit large to handle at times, but is much smaller than the lightest duty 1/2"" size drill.  I can drive a #12 X 3 1/2"" wood screw into dense pine and it does not even slow it down!  It is well made, does not leak oil, and will probably last for the rest of my life.

On the USA Product:  This is frustrating to say the least.  It says Milwaukee WI in large letters everywhere; and, all the info you can get on line would leave you believing that you are getting a good American made tool..... even the price is high enough to be USA made.  Then, in really small print on the very base of the manufacturers ID tag on the drill, it says ""Made in China"" and that is the only way you find out that you have been had..... again.

SUMMARY: It is a good drill, and does do the job well..... but, though they took the jobs to China, we pretty much still get a higher USA price!  I am disappointed by that.  Had I known it was not a USA made drill, and it was just another, pick a ""China vs. China"" product, I would have bought a less expensive unit like Sears, B & D, or Skill, etc. for about $25 to $30 less money.  I do think that we need to demand that Amazon require these folks to list where it is made in the listing.... that is only reasonable.

UPDATE:  I have used this drill for while now to do some really HD type of screw driving and drilling.  It is one stout drill!  You had better hang on because it has VERY good torque for such a small drill.
I still hate the keyless chucks, but this one has the best keyless chuck I have used to date!  Enjoy.",4.0
"Would have been 5 stars if not for that darn made in china sticker. Rather embarrassing for the good ole U S of A that I could not find a domestically made worm drive saw anywhere.
As for performance. This thing cuts 2x's and plywood like scissors through cheap wrapping paper.  I bought it to cut 2.75"" thick oak beams. Full depth cut (in direct violation of instructions) was no problem. My old craftsman circular would have required a pass on each side and would have bogged down big time. This sucker powered right through in one pass!
Oh, and heavy duty does mean heavy in this case!  You'll want it with all that torque.",4.0
"For those of us who don't want to chisel by hand but don't have the money or room for a dedicated chiseling machine, this is  a really good tool. The one thing I would stress to everyone is follow the directions. I didn't at first and couldn't figure out why the chisel wouldn't push through the wood. The only two negative things I can say are that the finish wasn't the same as the picture (which I really couldn't care less about) and sliding the rings over my chuck to get to the quill was almost impossible. Now that they're in place though I don't think I'm ever going to get two of the adjustment rings off again. They're not affecting the function of the drill press so I don't think it matters either.

This thing makes fairly clean cuts. It only takes about 30 seconds to clean out the very bottom corners. Haven't found anything negative about it. Hoping it stays that way.",4.0

"I agree with most everyone here that the quality of this drill is top notch.  I've used it for drilling metal and hardwood with no problems as yet.  I've done a bit of wire wheel grinding too, but keep it to a minimum as I have burned out drills in the past doing that.

I was a bit dissapointed with it out of the box though.  Specifically the trigger lock didn't work properly - it wouldn't move low enough to hold the trigger.  I had to take apart the drill handle and shave some of the plastic down to get it functioning.  Not my idea of a good time.  The two cases didn't line up very well which may have had something to do with it.  Also, as others have said, the forward / reverse switch is a bit flimsy.

I returned a dewalt to buy this Milwaukee.  Didn't much like the dewalt at all - full plastic case, no side handle, plastic chuck, made in china, with questionable details.  The few extra bucks for the Milwaukee buys a lot.  A case would be nice, but I prefer use that case money for a tool that is designed to not need one.",4.0
"This drill has great torque, it will twist your hand off if you use the the old ""hold the lock ring while you spin the chuck to tighten the bit"" method.  I could do that with my battery powered Dewalt 18 volt drill without incident.  Using this drill you better not do it!

This drill will handle anything you throw at it, but I greatly dislike the chuck.  You can not get it as tight as a normal keyed chuck and some of the materials I drill though cause the bit to slip.  It is especially prevalent with the small sized bits.

I would give this drill 5 stars if the chuck was keyed!",4.0

"I bought the Jet after much researching and I'm pleased that I made this choice. I was concerned about assembly after reading some reviews. The saw was delivered at about 11:30 a.m. and I made the first cut on it at about 4:00 p.m. and that includes install the Incra TS III fence. It's a big job to do by yourself but with a little planning it can be done. Putting on the wings and getting them levelwasn't too bad. I clamped a 2X4 to the table leaving about 12"" hanging over. Then I could push the wing up to the board and get a bolt started.
My first cut was to check the 90 setting of the blade. I ripped a short piece of stock and stood it on the table on its cut edge. Slid the square up to it and there was no light to be seen. Very impressed.
I am less than impressed with the included blade, however and a new one will be the next purchase.",4.0
"After much research, I decided on the Jet with the cast iron extensions.  I anticipated trouble with the directions, and was surprised by how simple and straighforward they were.  Maybe JET re-wrote them recently, but they were clear and simple, and assembly was a breeze.  Of course, Jet being Jet, my saw arrived missing one bag of hardware needed to attach the rear fence rail, but I called Jet and got the hardware three days later.  I agree that the JetFence could be better, but it's more than adequate for the time being.  It locks down securely, but it can toe out on you (just check before you cut).  I'll eventually upgrade to the Xacta.  Fit and finish were great, and the saw (with a Forest WW2 combination blade) is accurate and powerful.  Definitely wire it for 230, preferably on a dedicated circuit.  Overall, I'm very pleased, and give it 4 stars (because of the missing hardware).",4.0
"I got tired of all of the problems I was having with my old benchtop table saw, saved my pennies and purchased a new JWTS-10 table saw.  I elected to spend the extra money and get the model with the cast iron table extensions and I'm glad that I did.  I had read the horror stories of bad instructions and even a few mismatched parts and was not exactly looking forward to the assembly.  Boy was I surprised!  Not only was assembly a breeze but I had no problem with the instructions at all.  My friends all know that I'm no rocket scientist.  If you purchase this saw you will need a couple of extra hands as well as a strong back.  This is one heavy tool.  The cast iron wings require two people to attach and turning the saw up on all fours is no easy chore.
All of the adjustments were right on the money straight from the box and did not require anything further.  The overall fit and finish were excellent.  If there was any complaint at all it is very minor.  The rip fence is good but could be better and the small plastic adjustable cursor used for adjusting the rip fence was 1/8 of an inch too long.  A few seconds on the sander took care of that minor problem.  This is one smooth and quiet tool and will probably outlast me.  I just hope my grandchildren enjoy woodworking.",4.0

"The Mortising attachment works fine.  The operator does need to be accurate with his/her positioning of the wood.  The rating would have been five stars, except that the included directions to attach to a drill press could be more explicit.  There is a set of directions available on the Delta web site that explain the set-up in greater detail.",4.0
"So there are a lot of hot and cold reviews. This thing has been around for a long time and it has always been seen as decent, but not great. A dedicated mortiser is always better but this gets the job done. The main bit is the yoke that attaches to the drill press. Not much to it and it works. The fence is a bit fiddly to set up but it works. The machining of the screws could be better on everything. The lock screw for the chisel is not great but again, it works. I think the big issue is that the chisels are not top quality and have burrs on them from the factory. To me a factory grind on a tool is never acceptable so I always assume some sharpening will need to be done. You need a conical diamond stone and a flat sharpening stone of some kind to properly sharpen the chisels. Once you give them a good edge this tool works very well. The mortise sill requires some cleanup by hand but it does get the job done.

So in summary, it works after some setup and tuning. It is not the greatest option for making mortises, but for the price, and not having to buy a dedicated machine it does work.",4.0
"Very universal, easy set up and a solid system",4.0
"I have used this tool to place hundreds, if not thousands of biscuits on all kinds of projects.  The fence can be a little tough to adjust, as it tightens with a wing nut on each end of a threaded rod.  You must turn both ends at the same time to get a tight grip.  I find that I use it without the fence most of the time.  The blade is mounted such that it hits the middle of 3/4"" stock just sliding on the base.  I clamp my work to the extension table on my table saw and just slide the biscuit joiner on the table surface.  It is easy to hit your marks on edge joints this way.  For right angle joints, I use a guide clamp (like a Tru-Grip CT24C) squared on the workpiece (i.e. the side of a bookcase) so the base of the joiner rests where the bottom of the shelf will be.  It is easy to make a verticle plunge into the board resting on the table.
The depth of cut is easy to fine tune, and there are positive adjustment stops for three sizes of biscuits.
One thing I don't like about this tool is the ""clattering"" sound it makes while running.  I have run this machine quite a bit and never had a problem, but it has sounded like a loose bearing from the time it was new.  The fence could use some improvement, but that is easy to work around.

"I didn't want to but I had to...buy a blade guard!  I got my new Delta Unisaw with a 52"" Biesemeyer Fence and I assembled it minus the blade guard it came with for obvious reasons...they get in the way!  So, I  figured I'd just go without until I made my first few cuts with this power  horse machine.  Well, I started having flashbacks of an accident that  almost cost me my thumb a few months ago because the guard that came with  the blade kept getting in the way.  Remembering the sound of my hand  hitting the blade and how quickly bad things can happen...I ordered the  Deluxe Uniguard.
It came a day ahead of time on Fedex 3 Day Express.  I  opened it up and took out the plans AND as usual, there was no indication  that this would fit on a saw with Biesemeyer Fence.  It only showed the  Unifence and some other type but not mine!  After looking the situation  over, I had a choice.  Either send it back to Toolcrib and get the  Biesemeyer Blade Guard (which [costs] more) or make it fit!  I decided to  make it fit.  For those of you that have a Biesemeyer Fence, it can be done  but you have to turn the three support brackets upside down, mark and drill  three 3/8 inch holes along the rear fence rail.  What made mine a little  harder was that I installed an outfeed table too so I had to work around  it.  Anyway, three hours and three titanium drill bits later, I had my  Blade Guard installed and it works great.  I may get rid of the splitter  but my mind is at ease now as my hand passes by the blade.
All in all, I  like it...for a blade guard.  It was hard to spend the money but how much  is a thumb or finger worth?  Besides the heads up on the Biesemeyer  problem, I sure wish they would have included all the stuff to move the  power switch to the arm of the guard.  Giving us a plug box at the base of  the vertical post with a pre-wired switch would have been great.  As it is,  it just makes for a good picture.  I'd give it a five star for quality but  it just too hard for me to give a blade guard a high rating!",4.0

Crude may be slightly harsh, but I cant think of another word for it. If it didn't work as it should, I would have returned it for a refund. Oh !!, one other thing is the dust bag works perfectly.

Im sure I will complain or fabricate my own new lever.  otherwise it is a very well designed tool - fence mounted handle, real rack and pinion adjustment (vs makitas one sided fake one), and a nice blade. I hope they replace all the plastic adjusters with durable ones for the future. good luck with this one. I would have liked to love this tool.",4.0
"The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because of the way it adjusts and the fact that the blade isn't quite centered from top to bottom.  Use scrap, test out what you're joing, and then there's no problem.  The knob for the height adjustment is a rack and pinion system and it hasn't gotten clogged with dust or anything yet. The adjustment could be a more micro adjustment for finer work.  I've used it for 3/4"" cabinet grade plywood, making T joints, 90 degree joints, and attaching mitered corners together.  It's a great basic plate joiner for the price.  When I have a need in the future I may spend more money on a more advanced tool but this one is great for now.",4.0
"The knives are very sharp, well machined and do what they're supposed to do.

I have 2 quibbles with these Delta replacement parts.  First is that the price is pretty high for the product, but I guess that's what you're going to find with an OEM replacement part.  Second thing is that they could supply these with a sharpened edge on both sides so that you could just flip them over when they need replacement.

I recommend using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rockler-Magnetic-Jointer-Jig/dp/B004AJYQIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rockler Magnetic Jointer Jig</a>&nbsp;(or equal) to set these knives. The jig makes the process go much more quickly.",4.0

"We need a saw to cut aluminum; bars, flat plate, extrusion etc... By purchasing that saw, it allows me to throw away the old saw (same kind, same model) to the garbbage. Since the old one last 20+ years, I expect this one should do the same.",4.0
I installed this attachment on a Unisaw with a Beisemeyer fence. You need to remove the left table cast wing and cut back the fence hardware as well. I cut mine back right on the saw with a Sawzall. Only took a few minutes. The system installs in a few hours total and has enough adjustment to get it aligned. The first cut was perfectly square and smooth. Works well for me.,4.0
"I wrote my first review when the sliding table was partially installed.  I (obviously) was not happy at the time for the reasons cited in that review.  However, to be fair to Delta, and to give my fellow enthusiasts the best portrayal of the tool, I am writing again.  First, I was able to flatten the sliding table using braces and shims, though if you had the same problem Delta would warranty the table.  Remember, mine sat in the box until the warranty had expired.  I did order a replacement table from Delta in case my straightened table gave me more problems.  Though Delta couldn't offer a warranty replacement, they did pick up the shipping charge (they offered, I didn't have to ask).
Adjusting the table to the saw is a tedious task so plan on spending almost as much time on this part as bolting the pieces on.  Be sure to verify that the travel tube is parallel to the saw blade as I had to shim (one less feeler gauge in the world) mine to get the alignment correct.  Also, I set the table about fifteen thousandths above the saw table and I am finding this works fine.
Once set up, the sliding table works as intended.  It easily moves long or wide stock cleanly through the blade.  With the setup disappointments behind me and some experience with the table, I now have to give it the ""thumbs up!""",4.0
"Using this blade with a Delta TwinLaser miter saw, I have consistently obtained clean, splinter-free cuts.  Look at the blade, however.  The shot on this site depicts a 72T blade, and the rack at the home improvement store where I purchased mine also had 72T and 80T ""Fine Cut Off"" blades mixed together.  I have the 80T blade.
Sure, it doesn't have a PTFE coating, but wiping down a blade from time to time with a bit of solvent to clean off pitch is no big task.  And Freud's carbide tips are beefy and sharp.  I don't anticipate any problems, having had good luck in the past with their Diablo 7.25"" circular saw blades.",4.0
This is an excellent blade it's  very sharp and produces a finish quality cut. You can cross cut anything and the results are always perfect. The expansion slots the thin kerf and the carbide teeth balance out nicely resulting in an excellent blade. This one is worthy of re-sharpening...eventually. Now get out there and cut some wood.,4.0

"I have to admit, I have a love/hate relationship with products from Delta.

I own their wet/dry grinder, the tenoning jig for my table saw, their 12"" Planer (older version with the rubber strap handles) and now this mortising attachment for my drill press.

They include a number of spacers, meant for a number of different diameters of quills. I found the one mine (a floor model Rigid) and ran into the same thing most other tools from Delta have: grease all over these parts. I had to degrease my tenoning jig with paint thinner, and I'd much rather have this problem than rust.

Since I planned to cut mortices into hard eastern maple, I decide to make sure the chisel I planned to use was sharp. I lapped the faces with an 8000 water stone and also touched up the inside cutting edge with a diamond cone file from Lee Valley.

The hold downs for the work piece needed tweaking as they were an old shape of leg (I'd roughed them out with the band saw already)

The mortices needed work (I hadn't squared up the peice to the chisel properly) and I'd cutting the tenons using just a dado blade without using my tenoning jig.

All in all, a great tool if you don't want to have a dedicated tool for mortices.",4.0
"I had been looking at this joiner for a while and finally bought it when it was on sale for $83.99 + 10% off + free shipping (marked down from $119). I am very happy with it so far, a satisfied customer. I just used it to build an entryway bench for the Mrs and it came out great.

Since I like to know the downside of items I buy on amazon, here are the things I would change about this joiner if I could. None of them are deal breakers:

- The on/off switch is slightly clumsy.

- The dustbag does not stay on. I solved this problem by wrapping some tape around the dust port a few times.

- Dust collection is very marginal. Hooking the shop vac up to the dust port completely solved this problem.

- Setting the fence height is slightly difficult. The scale on the front isn't super accurate, so a few test cuts in scrap wood helped get things lined up before making real cuts.

- There is no angle scale on the tilting fence. I probably will not be making too many cuts that are not 90 or 45 degrees, so no biggie once again.

Overall, I am quite happy with this joiner and feel like I got a great deal on it.",4.0
"The first joiner I recived was defective and needed to be returned. The next one proved to be the easiest one I've used yet. The only weak point so far is the fence hold down nut loosens a little too easy. That is something that needs to be monitored during operation. The bottom line is that I would definitely buy it again.

My sincere thanks to Amazon.com, you are the most awesome people and faster than a magician and always willing to please a customer.",4.0

"Overall, the Fein Multimaster is a GREAT tool.  I own another of a different brand, yet always reach for the Fein.  This particular attachment is good for plunge cuts only.  If you try to run the length of a board/piece of wood, it will stray/walk on you, leaving a really ugly, wavy cut, EVEN if you press against your guide firmly.  The circle/semi-circle attachment is better for that but it's weak; it bends easily.  The last time I bought the latter attachment, I used it once then tossed it because it was so mangled.  Quite delicate for a power tool attachment.",4.0
"I use a Delta X5 contractor's Saw as my primary table saw.  I do just enough dado and tenon work that it spends most of its time without the blade guard or splitter in place.  As the Delta is set up, removing and re-installing these is just bothersome enough to appeal to my lazy side.  I finally put in a Merlin splitter a while back, which gave me some margin of safety, but the simple truth is that I needed a blade guard that floated over the blade.  After some price and feature comparisons I decided to use the Uniguard.

The Uniguard is one of the least expensive, and actually has a lot of features.  It has a split guard, which means that, on short cuts, the guard is still down.  It has an accessory tray and a place to mount an upper switch.  It is one of the few guards that can be altered to fit a wide variety of saw tables.  And it even looks cool - or as cool as a table saw add-on might look.

I trimmed about 9 inches off of the upper pipe to get the Uniguard to fit with an acceptable overhang for my table placement.  As you can see from other reviews installation can be a bit exciting, especially if you are trying to do it yourself.  It's actually fairly simple, but the weight of the main body of the guard is enough to make things awkward.  The Merlin splitter won't work with the Uniguard in place, but the supplied splitter is quite good, and nearly as easy to switch out.

One everything is in place and adjusted the Uniguard is a pleasure to work with.  It never seems to be in the way and there is plenty of clearance.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced blade guard with a lot of flexibility, the Uniguard is worth serious consideration.  Especially if you have a friend to help you install it.

One interesting thing.  Klutz that I am, I managed to bring the guard down into the blade and take a chunk out of the middle piece (the 'upper' guard).  While the saw continued to work fine I discovered that there is a wind tunnel effect under the guard and the blade would whistle loudly.  When I put in the replacement part (Delta parts and service is excellent, by the way) I found I had to carefully adjust the guard to get rid of the noise.  Now it's fine and I'm back to being a happy sawyer.",4.0
"The Delta 34-976 Uniguard blade guard and splitter is a good choice for your Delta Contractor Saw or Unisaw (and works with some other brands).  There are similar and superior products out there (Excalibur by Sommerville Design, Biesemeyer, Exaktor, Brett Guard; search google for ""Tablesaw Splitters and Blade Covers"" for a review by Kelly Mehler), but the Uniguard  is very good for the price.  I have only minor complaints: no integrated dust collection (as in more expensive units), and it took longer to install and align than I expected.

Once installed, the unit offers a world of convenience and safety compared to the splitter and blade guard that came with your saw.  For non-thru cuts, you can easily remove the splitter without tools, but still have the benefit of the blade guard.

However, the big U-shaped tube may get in the way of cross-cutting long pieces of wood.  On my Delta Contractor Saw with 32"" extension table and the Uniguard installed, I am limited to about 62"" to the right of the blade.  A workaround is to loosen then bolts on the big tube and swing it back down and out of the way, but of course you won't have a blade guard (unless you re-install the one that came with your saw, and you won't want to do that).  The other workaround is to have the long part of the work to the left of the blade, but then you don't get the benefit of the extension table.

As others have reported, the package is rather large and somewhat heavy, partly because of the wood used to crate the unit.  Mine arrived in excellent condition but was missing three flat washers for 3/8"" bolts.

To install the unit, you'll need some wrenches (socket, adjustable, etc) of the usual sizes, both metric and fractional inch hex keys (Allen wrenches) of various sizes including the somewhat unusual 8mm size, and (if using an extension table to the right of the blade) a 9/64"" drill (I got by with a 1/8"" drill).  A square and steel ruler are useful for adjusting the splitter.

I suggest you put a towel or rug on the floor when setting the U-tube down, to avoid marring it.  Another thing I learned the hard way was that while installing the U-tube, which is quite heavy, you have to keep an eye on it until the screws are tightened.  While looking down at one of the bolts, the top part of the tube decided to swing down and bonked me pretty good on the forehead.  The tube is very heavy, and I was momentarily stunned by the blow, but it served as another reminder to be careful in the shop.

The manual suggests that if you have a 30"" Unifence and table extension, you can cut 12"" from the large tube.  I suggest that you refrain from doing this until you find your saw too bulky with the Uniguard installed.  The extra 12"" on the tube may come in handy if you want to have a work piece that is more than 52"" to the right of the blade.

For step 25, I was unable to position the blade guard in a way that the blade cleared both the splitter and the blade guard when the blade is set to 45 degrees.  The solution is given in step 26, which I didn't notice at first.

Overall I'm satisfied with the unit, and believe it will make using my table saw both more safe and more enjoyable.  I'll save time over having to remove and reinstall the old blade guard the way I used to, but considering the time to install the Uniguard, payback won't come for awhile.

UPDATE: I decided to build an outfeed table for my saw.  Most designs expect to use the same holes in the back of the table that are needed to attach the big tube to the saw.  As a result, having this blade guard installed seriously complicates attaching an outfeed table.  I ended up using a piece of iron plate (hardware store) to join the wooden outfeed table, using the same bolts that hold the big tube.  It works great now, but it was difficult to design, build, and install.

UPDATE 2: I'd like to get an Incra TS-LS fence system, but the screw holes on the back of the saw are required by both the Uniguard and the Incra system.  I don't know if it is possible to have both installed on the saw at once - maybe by drilling some new holes?

UPDATE 3: I got the Incra TS-LS fence system.  It IS possible to install that fence system, and then install the Delta Uniguard Saw Blade Guard.  Basically the brackets for the blade guard mount to bottom of the TS-LS real rail.  It is straightforward and reliable to have them working together,  and I'm glad to have them both on my saw working together.  The Incra TS-LS is a dream fence system for my table saw.",4.0
"I purchased this as a first plate jointer to get some experience with how they can be used in my projects.  I haven't experienced the issues with noise that several reviewers have noticed.  Considering many of these jointers can go for double the money, and that my projects are relatively basic, this seemed to be a good match.  I think this is a great unit for beginners or as a backup unit.

UPDATE FEBRUARY 2009 - When I bought this unit, I figured it'd be good for maybe a year or two.  Four years out, it continues strong.  It has an annoying tendency for the chip chute to clog up from time to time, which takes a bit of effort to unclog.  But it does great work, and with a little bit of care ensuring your alignment is clean, it works well.  Wish all of my tools were as bulletproof.",4.0
"I use this joiner to build solid wood panels for table tops and cabinet doors and for this it works fine.  The tool seems well built, has adequate power, and I do not need a tilting fence for beveled joints.  The fence height adjustment could be a little easier, but I almost always use 3/4"" stock so I rarely have to adjust it. It does make a disconcerting rattle when it is shut off, but this seems to be normal.  The price is also reasonable for what is basically an angle grinder with a fence and carbide blade.  If you are a typical hobbyist like me, then this joiner is all you'll ever need.  Save yourself the $...that you would need to spend on the fancier models for biscuits, glue, stock, etc.",4.0
"I recently received my first JS102 and sent it back because the fence scales (one per side) clearly indicated the fence was 1/32"" crooked. I determined this was due to the drilling for the two pivot pins being uneven at the lower edge.  Everything else looked very precise, but the pivot pin misalignment throws the entire plate off. I called Freud (the phone number included with the product is not correct) and they said they had never heard of such a misalignment and would have to see the item before sending me out a replacement part.  Maybe reasonable, but would take several more weeks at least. I returned the item ... (they even paid shipping) and ordered a second JS102.  The second one has the same defect. (It does have a different serial number!).  I decided to keep this one since they must all be this way. If the factory could figure out how to drill the two pivot holes inline with each other (or fire the worker that prides speed over precision) this would be a perfect tool.  Wonder how many other JS102 owners have seen the same defect.",4.0

The faults that I can make on the saw are

The electric brake could be stronger. We run a 15"" carbide blade that weighs about 5lbs so the blade does not stop as fast as we like.

It would be very handy to have a second cup so that you can at least run water through the gun to clean it w/out emptying the one cup that came w/it.

The quality hasn't changed, but the market has.  If a basic router fits your usage, however, you've found the right one - and without maintenance worry on features you don't need.

Answer

Taken from Delta's website:

Model 17-924

...Also fits drill presses with quill diameters of 66 mm, 50.8 mm, 48 mm and 38 mm...",4.0
"The Delta 17-1924 mortising attachment worked well.  I found the hold down bars a bit awkward to use, but all in all it proved to be a helpful addition to my shop.",4.0
"I purchased this mortising attachment hoping it would fit an old Rockwell Delta drill press I just bought from an estate sale.  Well, it didn't fit that but just for kicks I tried it on my previous drill press, a 10"" Benchtop drill press from Delta model #DP200.
It fit like a charm and worked perfectly even though this is not one of the Delta models the instructions say that the mortising attachment fits.  The chisels and bits are in perfect shape and sharp.  I got clean, accurately spaced mortises on my first attempt.
The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is that one plastic handled threaded knob (used for fixing a workpiece holdown in place) was missing from the kit.  I had another one the right size that fits my Delta Tenoning jig so it wasn't that much of a problem for me but still, it should have had all the parts when it was shipped.",4.0
"I almost sent this thing back, since it didn't fit correctly on my Craftsman 15"" drill press.  Once I did some necessary modifications, however, (a couple of washers as spacers, mounting it a little lower on the quill collar, etc.) I was able to get it to work and decided to keep it anyway.  Most of all, I like the versatility this kit adds to my old drill press. I figured I needed a dedicated mortiser clogging up my little shop as much as I need a (square) hole in my head!
  I don't think the set-up is that bad - although I quickly disconnected Delta's ""handy"" spring loaded spline wrenches on their fence hold-down bolts.  (I don't know how your supposed to start the bolt on the nut with those things getting in your way - I just keep them handy for final snugging)
  Anyway, I find set-up to be a simple two step process: (1) slip on the collar and the load the desired size mortise bit/chisel, and (2) bolt the auxiliary fence to your table.  Too keep everything square, I just clip a 12-inch ruler or straight stick to the back side of the chisel and set the fence at the desired clearance on both ends of the ruler.
  I find the whole set-up time similar to setting up a dado on the table saw - it takes a little measuring, but once you've done it a couple of times it's no big deal.
  I probably would've given 5 stars if this had fit my drill.  I still can't figure out why it didn't, maybe I'm reading my model number wrong...",4.0
"I haven't used this a lot, but I do have some comments. I have the Delta DP400 drill press. I bought the mortising attachment from another company not knowing it was also a Delta brand. When I got it, I read the instructions and started to install it. At first I found out that all three bushings that were supplied didn't fit. A couple of pages later I found out that for my type of Delta press, they weren't needed and it fit perfectly without needing one. The manual didn't make any mention of the DP400 model specifically.
One odd problems was that the T-nut that is used to mount the fence to the table wasn't tapped. I had to anneal it and then run a tap through it. Of course this was happening about 1am, so it wasn't like I could get to a hardware store.
One last item is about aligning the mortising chisel and fence. While I haven't made an alignment jig yet, I plan on making one by very carefully aligning the fence then making a single hole into a straight piece of wood. After that I can just plug the chisel into the hole and use the attached board to align the fence. I will go ahead and drill a hole using all four chisels.
Overall, it seems well made and fits my Delta drill press perfectly. It seems pretty stout and while the carrying case doesn't fit well, it does hold everything. You just have to disassemble almost everything first.",4.0
This unit works good enough for my use. I don't use it that often & running out of room to set up another machine. Outstanding tool for those like me that use it just every now & then.,4.0
"Works very well on my drill press.  Set-up was no big deal, it took only 15 min the first time I used it.  Do not be swayed by the ""handy carrying case"" claim however.  The case was clearly made for some other tool and the kit will not fit so the lid will close.  Delta should stop making this claim!",4.0
"""For the money"" is the key phrase here. Compared to buying a dedicated mortiser or doing it by hand this tool is chpear than the former and quicker than the latter. The good things are that it does work. Once you have it installed, aligned, and tweaked it seems to work fine. I use it in oak without a problem. People who are burning or breaking bits may need to adjust the position of the dril vs the position of the square chisel. Or maybe they have a defect of some sort. It seems to help if you back out often and allow the bit to clear itself of debris.
Now for the bad. The molded plastic case seems like it doesn't really fit. There are not slots for all the piece and no matter how you put the parts in it doesn't seem quite right. This seems like a pretty obvious mistake so I assume Delta is just too lazy to address this. The setup requires a bit of patience and time. If the bit is not exactly square to the fence you get some wacky looking holes.  Lots of fussy screws, knobs, etc.
Overall this is better than not having a mortiser and the price is right. I would buy it again since I don't want or need to invest the money or storage space required for a dedicated mortiser.",4.0
"I purchased this attachment a couple months ago, and it has proven to be a real surprise.

However, in my work I prefer to have larger spacers and so had to send this job to my local blade and bit manufacturer who produced a set of thicker spacers.

The only real difference between the original saw I owned and the new one is that the shoe has been sanded perpendicular to the saw blade, (as opposed to parallel) which makes for a slow gliding saw, but it has worn and smoothed out just fine after a few months use.

"First, let me say this is about the Freud SD508 with the 5/8 arbor, not the dial a width and not the unit the 1-inch arbor. it seems that some of the reviews are about different Freud dado sets. Either they are posted under the wrong product or all Freud reviews are posted together.

Second, whe reading reviews, look for the ones that are marked ""verified purchase"". I see a lot of reviews that are 5-star or 1-star, with little to no write-up, and believe that those are from company shills, for or against the manufacturer.

Now on the the review.

I was excited about trying my new Freud dado set, so I decided to cut some dados right away. I am not a professional and have a Bosch 4100-09 saw with the gravity raise stand. While the saw can cut dados, it has a maximum width of 13/16 inch - due to the length of its arbor.

For my first cut I went 13/16 wide and 1/2 inch deep and cut into some scrap red oak from an earlier project.

The dado set cut smoothly with hardly any resistance. The sides were straight and smooth. The shoulder was a prefect 90 degrees. The bottom was fantastic. The bottom was smooth, without any ridge lines between the blades or chippers. My previous dado set always seemed to leave one or more ridges in the bottom that I had to chisel or sand ut.

I tried several difference widths, both with and without shims. All of the cuts came out great.

The only fault I can come up with is the box and its internal plastic liner. While the box looks solid and thick, it is actually thin, and considering the weight of the dado set, I find it to be flimsy.  The inside red plastic liner is also thin and flimsy. The red plastic is the thin, crinkly plastic used in packaging, not the standard heavy plastic used for storage and repeated handling. The plastic between the blades and chippers is the same thin packaging plastic. (It reminds me of the plastic trays that cheap Christmas ornaments come in.)

The liner is weak enough that shipping had caused both blades and three chippers to come out of their storage slot and were on top or the plastic liner when I first opened the set. To protect my set, I plan to made a wooden insert and find some heavier plastic or rubber blade/chipper dividers for stoage.

Overall, I love the Freud SD508 dado set. It cuts beautiful dados. However, for the price,  I think it should come with a more substantial storage because while carbide is hard, carbide hitting against carbide is an easy way to damage the teeth.

Great dados, needs a better storage case.",4.0
"I haven't used it yet - but was surprised by how complicated it is to change from 1/4 to 1/2 "" dado... I thought the dial would make this easy but it seems it is still a matter of stacking the blades just like the less expensive freud kits..",4.0

"blade works as designed and certainly a must for the blade selection for fein multimaster, great for fine cut shipped fast",4.0
"I have owned this for about 9 years now and have had no issues.  Plenty of power, fairly good balance and ""feel"", the base is wide enough to be stable, brake is good and depth adjustment is pretty good.  Prior to this I have owned (and still do) a Black & Decker Sawcat and Super Sawcat.  For my money and hundreds of hours on the job, the Super Sawcat was THE perfect circ saw.  GREAT balance, plenty of power and good brake- also VERY wide baseplate- and LIGHT!  Still have it and it's no longer in production as far as I know.  Lots of pros in New England were using that in the 80's.  Black & Decker sold out to DeWalt.  I run finish blades on that puppy.  I use this DW364 for framing and reno work.  It's really pretty good but just does not have the balance that the Super Sawcat has.

It is a bit tricky to have to ""peek"" over the adjustment housing to actually see the cut.  Again, the SS was better, and the guide ""notch"" for cut guide reference is not ideal.  At first it's easy to cut on the wrong side.  Minor points.  It's a good saw and definitely worth the money.  Would be nice if it came with a rip fence.  Almost nothing get's a five star rating in my book, (the Super Sawcat would have) but this is probably 4 1/2.",4.0
"For as expensive as this set is, the inside of the case is awful. It's made if the same plastic material that a chocolate Easter bunny comes in and naturally, it cracked during shipping under the weight of the set and the blades rubbed together for the whole ride.",4.0

"I give the blade set 5 stars, but I was extremely disappointed with the Freud packaging.  It's cheap.  It falls way below the quality I've come to expect from Freud.  When I opened the case, the blades had been jostled around during shipping and the blades were no longer fixed into position.  The teeth of some of the blades where in contact with each other.  I checked for any nicks on the blade teeth, but fortunately found none.",4.0
Works great very pleased,4.0
"Fein is an excellent product. The blades do seem to wear out sooner than expected considering the price this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
I also think Shipping and Handling are a bit too much. Shipping and handling from Amazon Fulfillment Services out of North Las Vegas was 25% of the bill, not including taxes. The product cost $14.72 and S&H was $5.14.
I could have mailed the same exact package via USPS First Class for $ $2.58.",4.0
"I compared this saw to a Milwaukee 6390. Advantages of this model are the rear pivot (you don't need to adjust the handle to keep it close to the shoe, it's always where you want it) and the blade brake. The brake stops the blade in 2 to3 seconds, the Milwaukee has no brake and takes 3 times that long. If I had bought this saw first and never tried the Milwaukee, I never would have looked back. This saw is a bit heavy, but it balances well, feels solid, and cuts very very well.

In the end this saw gets second place for two reasons. First, although there is a nice big notch in the upper blade guard to let you see your cut line, the front-mounted height adjustment is in the way so you have to lean forward to get a peek. Second, the Milwaukee just turns wood to vapor. The Dewalt is a very strong saw and never bogged down a bit. But the 6390 feels like magic when it cuts. It's not just the blade, I swapped them and while the Endurance blade is far superior to the DeWalt, either way the Milwaukee just makes you want to cut your picnic table in pieces for the sheer joy of it.",4.0
"In 1998 I was buying a few of the last high-end items needed to start my own roofing company when I bought this saw. After dealing on several other tools, I asked the salesman (a retired general contractor) what was the best circular saw in the store. Without pause, he grabbed this DeWalt. I have other saws available, but this is practically the only saw that I've used since June of '98. I'm a teacher so I only do carpentry in the summers, but still this saw has been subject to a lot of use and more than a little abuse. It still works perfectly. It's an incredibly powerful and durable saw. If you use good quality blades, I don't believe that the wood exists that it can't cut through with ease.
If there were three things that I'd do to improve it, it would be these:
1. make it lighter
2. left-side cutting blade instead of right-side
3. laser-light guide for cutting
I know that the first two are already available on newer models, but I've yet to use them. If everything else is the same, those saws should be darn close to perfect. My next circular saw will be a DeWalt, but it might be several years until I need one.",4.0
"While it being an impressive claim considering the quality of DeWalt portable tools, the DW364 is still a far cry from the Super Sawcat of the late to early 90's.
The DW364 was the first Dewalt (of the yellow variety) circular saw that featured an electric brake. It's strong shoe/base coupled with a strong knob/depth adjuster makes this as solid a saw out in the market. Blade changing is practical with the blade lock feature. Easy motor brush access, makes this saw very easy to self-service.

Now, just a tip for plastic cutting. You need to play with the various speeds on the Fein tool. There is a ""sweet spot"" where it cuts like butter. It is fast enough to cut, but does not melt the material.

It worked great for my purposes, can't comment on other materials.",4.0

"First, if you own a Fein Multi-master you MUST have this blade as it has the most universal use of any of their blades.

I have used this blade for many projects a) drywall cut outs [especially recepticle cutouts], b) cutting through HVAC ductwork, c) cutting through formica d) trimming doorway and window trim e) many more.  Everything you do with this blade (or the Fein tool in general), you could do with another tool, BUT, this is handy, quick and has saved me many, many, many hours.

Why 4 stars - primarily versatility.  Why not 5 stars?  blade life and cost.  The good news is that it runs highly discounted every few months at Amazon.",4.0

I have used the sears blade and they last about as long as the Fein blade. I know where I buy my blades from! Maybe Fein will get the message and become more competive in their prices/",4.0

"It fits, the rest is up to the operated, appears to be of good quality",4.0
good saw. the case could not be any cheaper. latches don't work,4.0
This rip fence fits fine on our circular saw.  The screw for tightening it down comes included.  The only negative thing I could say about this fence is that it does not fit squarely in the notch molded into the saw's case.  It extends just a bit further than the slot.  The case still closes fine.  The extra material that sticks out probably makes it easier to pull it out of the case.  Otherwise.  I would recommend this product,4.0
"Fits the saw (c7sb2) just fine.  Does not, however, fit into its holder in the case.  So it has to bounce around in there.  Not a big deal, but as a genuine Hitachi part you would think it would fit the case better.  But, if you buy a Hitachi saw, this is the rip fence you need.",4.0
"Works great,",4.0
"I own a Bosch 4100-09 worksite table saw and wanted to buy the Dial-a-width SD608 after reading a lot of good reviews about it.

In a nutshell, the SD608 works on the Bosch 4100-09 table saw, but you can't use all the chippers to cut the maximum possible dado width on it.

The set is very well-constructed but has limitations for me as I can only safely cut up to a 9/16 inch dado (two outside blades plus two 1/8 inch chippers) due to the design of my table saw. I have since come across a FAQ on Freud's website ([...]) which spells out the compatibility of the dado set.

For those Bosch 4100-09 owners who are considering buying the SD608, the measurements according to Freud's FAQ are as follows:
1. Inside arbor flange diameter (F): 2 inches
2. Arbor length (AL): 0.9 inches; Nut(N)=0.3 inches;
3. Wrench size (W): 0.9 inches (23mm)

Hopefully this review helps those Bosch 4100-09 table saw owners who are considering buying the SD608.",4.0
"I probably won't ever cut more than a 3/4"" dado, so the chipped chipper was a spare anyway, but I still say it should have arrived in factory condition.  I thought the package was a little flimsy, and no doubt the reason the carbide was able to chip out in the first place.  This is a real pricey dado blade set, so a better system of cutter separation would have been much appreciated.

I have made several cuts with it, and I haven't had any tear out, or chipped work pieces as of yet.  I usually prefer to use my router for dado cuts, but if I am going to be making a whole lot of small repetitive dado's and rabbets, then the blade is worth the time and set-up.

Some reviewers had trouble with the shims and their arbor, but I had no issues.  I am using this set on a Jet JTAS 10.",4.0
"Purchased this to replace my trusted 14 year-old SD508 set.  Based on the other reviews here, I carefully checked whether the arbor on my Delta Contractor II saw would be long enough before using it.  Sadly, it is not.  I never have needed to cut a dado wider than 3/4"", but the arbor nut will not engage with the A,D,D,D,D,B combo installed (nominal 3/4"").  I can't really fault the blade set, since it's hard to imagine how they could make the dial much thinner and the basic blade design is very similar to my current one.  Alas, I'll have to continue to use shims with my SD508 and start saving for that Unisaw!",4.0
Makita are great products I had one for 20 years and wore it out. The only item I would change is a quick change on angles,4.0
"I got this chop saw about a year or so ago.  It works great with good power to go through thick 2"" and 3"" stainless pipe and tube I have cut with it.  I would suggest finding the 2414b model as being able to ""rock"" the saw helps to cut through tough steel.  It seems like when you cut steel with a normal chop saw it gets half way through and doesn't cut as fast based on the angle.  The 2414b lets you basically adjust the saw angle so that it gets through it quicker.  I would give it 5 stars but my saw developed a problem.  It tripped the breaker as soon as I turned it on, without even cutting steel.  Took it to service and they corrected the problem.  I debated with many saws and tried many, but this is the best.",4.0
"I upgraded to this freud dial a dado switching from the freud SD508 set.  All in all I like it.  However I do find it annoying that if you want to make a standard size dado (say 3/8"") you have to look at the chart no matter what to figure out how to set it up.  Rather than use three 1/8"" chippers it says to use the two outside blades, the 3/32"" chipper and 16 clicks.  I find it annoying to have to pull the chart out every time to find out how many clicks each setup needs.  Also the included wrench does not fit a Sawstop table saw.  This is really not that big of an issue tough because the Sawstop arbor nut is wide enough to fit inside the dial a dado knob and still get Sawstop's blade wrenches on it.  I did install the full width dado on the Sawstop only to find that the arbor isn't quite long enough to support it safely, but that's ok too because I will never use the dado set to its full width.  I find it a little dangerous and would much rather use a smaller setup and make more passes.  The pros: The cuts are flawless as you would expect from any freud product.  Also not having to use shims to micro adjust your dado is great.  The carbides are also larger than the ones of the SD508.  I would recommend this set to any woodworker ... just don't lose that chart.",4.0
"This set up blades looks great.  You can tell how solidly they are manufactured.  The only issue I had was understanding the directions on how to change the blade orientation.  The set comes shipped for installation on a right-tilt saw.  I have a left tilt saw.  Despite  my graduate degrees, I, for the life of me, could not understand the written instructions.  In addition, I found a video on youtube.com that actually explain the process on how to switch the orientation from right-tilt to left-tilt.  Once again, I was unsuccessful. So, all I did it call Freud on the phone and explain the situation.  They offered to just do it for me.  I sent back the two outerblades and they changed they did it for me.  Excellent customer service from Freud.  I am extremely happy with the item now so much so, that my wife accussed me of having a secret club down in the basement (where my workshop is located) because I am there an awfull lot!",4.0
"Freud is known for a quality product. Working a lot with projects I am happy with paying for the SD model. It delivers a crisp clean cut as promised in the Super model. I use a portable Table saw which restrictes me to a 6 inch blade, instead of a 8"" inch. I also have to keep with a traditional dado. Really, once you start to use this set. Freud makes it simple even with shims U can tell its well thought out and put together tool. I would have to say the only improvement, thus far is the case it comes ion could be little less generic in design, but then again its not bad and makes the set more affodable. Also, Amazon makes it easy on the sweet price and delivery as usual!",4.0

I got this to help cut 1 1/4 inch off of a 4 1/4 inch baseboard. It worked well and provided for a pretty straight line all things considered. It is strong and holds well along the material you are using as a guide. There is already a retention space in the factory saw case for it too which is really nice for storage. The only cons in my book are that the slot it slides into on the saw base is a fixed angle which I'm not entirely sure is square. Additionally the end that rides along the material was not square to the shaft. I had to put it in a bench vise and bend it to eye square. One thing it looks like you could do since there are 2 holes in the guide end is attach a longer squared strip or 2 vertical strips etc. It probably should have come with the saw but I understand they can't include every bell and whistle and keep things affordable. For the price and the fact that there is already a space in the case this accessory is a must have for anybody with a compatible saw model.,4.0
Good quality,4.0
"I am a huge freud fan.  Freud just makes great quality products that the average consumer can afford.  With that being said this dado set is no different than any of the other freud products I have in my possession.  Cuts a nice dado with smooth edges and flat bottoms.  This is not the fastest cutting dado set in the world, but then again.  I do not really expect it to be in its price range.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the shims that come with it.  You can not really read the thickness markings on the shims, which isn't that big a deal if you have a good dial caliper, but not everyone has a good dial caliper.  Other than that it is a great dado set.",4.0
"Works great on my Ridgid R4513 table saw.  I had to order the dado throat plate from Gardner, Inc., who makes them for TTI (who makes this saw for Ridgid).  It wasn't very expensive, but I had to pay shipping.  If you can locate one on Amazon for a good price with free or cheap shipping, I would go that route.  I did find it a little odd how the center blades had to be set up, you have to be careful how you set the tips of the blades to avoid possible damage.  This is easy to do, but a little tedious.
I used this set to cut about 1 1/2"" x 1/2"" dados in solid maple, and it handled it like a champ.  It cuts through pine like butter!  I'm sure there are fancier and better kits out there, but this one works well.",4.0
"My first dado cutter was an ancient Sears non-carbide wobble type. It was pretty useless, of course, and years later I sprung for this Freud set. It was somewhat cheaper than the Forrest product, so this is what I chose.

I am happy with the quality of these blades. They are extremely thick and rugged, obviously good quality. Mine had no trace of rust or damage.

They certainly do a nice and safe job. I cannot say that the bottoms are perfectly smooth, but they are flat. The side blades do a nice job of not splintering the wood. Needless to say that they are a huge step up from the usual beginner-level of dado cutting.

A warning to first-time users: dado blades are a pain to install, no matter the brand. To really get the widths set correctly you have to make a test cut, take it all apart, play with shims and do it again. Wide widths on underpowered saws have to be done in stages. You will want to do all of your grooves at one time and not switch back and forth. Dado cutting demands good planning and careful set-up.

I like the case. It is sturdy, easy to use and very useful.

Many woodworkers use various router set-ups to make grooves and there are times when that makes sense, but for those perfectly sized grooves and clean cuts nothing matches a good dado set. If you do this kind of work, then this set is a good choice. If you want to spend more, then certainly the Forrest dado set would be a very nice choice indeed.

Surprisingly, the blades and chippers lost that perfect sharpness in fairly short time. To be fair, I was using a lot of ply and particle board then, and they don't seem to have gotten any duller since. While they didn't stay as sharp as my other Freud blades, they still work fine, even in my under-powered table saw. Still, that and the not perfectly smooth groove bottoms lose this set a star.

I would like to find a place that could do a good job of sharpening and radiusing them. They look like they could be resharpened many times as the carbide is thick. This is all part of the Industrial Life, so we have to deal with it.",4.0
"Most of us consider a $200 set of table saw blades to be quite an investment.  Certain things are expected with a purchase like this.  Packaging that is the exact same as what surrounds a barbie doll is not one of them.  My $100 cordless drill has a thick case with secure latches and solid support for the drill.  Imagine the disappointment when I opened the amazon box and discovered a flimsy plastic case that looks like it should contain a toy.  No big deal I thought, until I opened the case and found a broken plastic clam shell surround, with paper thin clam shell discs separating the blades.  Now I read some reviews from folks who commented positively on this case.  Seriously!?  This is dollar store packaging.  Indeed, the same stuff your take-out meal is packed with is the exact same material your new $200 stack dado is surrounded by.  Thank goodness the blades were OK and are outstanding.  Sharp, heavy, well made, with minimal batman ears on the cuts.  Blades certainly worthy of a solid, secure case and surround.  The only reason I didn't give this 3 stars or lower is because of the quality of the blades, which is what really matters.  If you are planning on using this set on job sites you better plan on building a custom case for them as this one won't last a farting spell.

"The only problem I had is with the fence.  The threaded holes for the nylon set screws were so rough you couldn't turn the screws.  The allen wrench keeps slipping in the nylon sockets.  Had to clean the holes out  with a 1/2""x13 tap.  That made the holes too loose.  A few wraps of  teflon tape around the screw threads took care of that problem.  The fence  face was not square with the table because the poly fence facing on one  side extended about a 1/16"" below the other.  The guide rail was  drilled incorrectly and the tape measure was about 1 1/2"" off.  Way  beyond the adjustment range of the cursor.  I bought the saw from a local  Woodcraft store.  They replaced everything with no problem, but we went  through 2 fences before we found one that was acceptable.  The replacement  guide rail fit perfectly, but the finish on this one was poor.  It looks  like there was no attempt made to sand out the rough spots before it was  painted.  So far this is cosmetic only.  Would I buy this saw again?  Yes.  But I would first make sure I checked out the fence kit... although that's  kind of hard to do through mail order.  There is also a clang when you  first turn on the saw.  Probably from the starting torque and maybe some  looseness in the motor mount and/or arbor and trunion, but the saw cuts  fine right now.  If there is any problem, I'm sure it will show up within  the warranty period.  I like the design of the fence, but the workmanship  in the fence does not match the quality of the rest of the saw.  I was told  by the store personnel that this is not an uncommon problem.  They were  prepared with the fixes.",4.0

I am glad I made the purchase, but in the future would love to have known that I needed allen keys, and a crescent wrench set and someone to hold the upper arm while I tightened the nut.

"I rate a 4 of 5 on the basis that the block itself is very solid with an easy install (can be a bit clumsy with one person, but if you can build the regular saw from the kit, you can definitely do this).  The only working problem that I have had with it is that the greater blade length means that any wobble in the blade can cause rubbing easier on the return side of the blade.
As the other reviews have said, if you plan on getting this in the future, do it before you buy blades due to the increased blade length.
However, think about whether you need to have a 12"" resaw capacity before you buy; if you don't, don't spend the money on this, buy some extra blades.  Just how often will you resaw and if you can't, how much trouble will it be?
On the other hand...  More Power!  Go for it.",4.0

The only improvement to this dado blade would be to stamp the chipper with its thickness. Otherwise it is a very good purchase.",4.0

The shims are not labeled, but you can easily tell them apart by the thickness.  I give the saw blades a 5 star and the Freud cheap plastic case and packing a 1 star at best.  The case will likely be broken or at least the inside packing will be damaged (as mine was). I called Freud and they did send me a new case.  So, 4 stars overall.",4.0
"Not a good unit for the price.  This has gone up since I bought it and is too high.  All the shims are accurate and easy to set up.  I thought a high dollar dial-in would have been nice but those were at least twice the price and do not always give a flat bottomed dado, but now I wonder at the current price.",4.0

My associates who work in the  interior trim industry swear by this model and its' 10"" cousin, and I  have used this saw for years on others' jobsites. The motor is  exceptionally strong, I've replaced bearings on five year old (used daily)  saws, with no electrical problems. The fact that wide moldings need to be  cut flat is a small drawback compared to the weight/size penalty of larger  saws, and easily gotten used to. A Forrest blade on this saw produces  superb results, even in chip-prone plys.",4.0
"As a carpenter who cuts a lot of plywood, I was interested in upgrading from a 'wobbly' dado to this system.  In general I was impressed with this set.  The plates and chippers are all substantial.  They are manufactured out of nice thick, flat stock, with large carbide teeth and a nice clean black finish.

I do my work on a Craftsman Professional 10"" tablesaw with a 1-1/8"" long threaded arbor.

The first thing I had to do was reassemble the outer plates to change the setup from a right-tilt, to a left-tilt configuration.  Before making dado cuts the user must consult the manual and determine the appropriate type and number of chippers to install between the outer plates.  A little color coding or some stenciled part numbers on the components would simplify the process, but if a person can read, they should be able to figure this out.

I found slipping the assembly over the arbor threads to be a little bit of a challenge due to the thickness of the components.  There is no 'slop' in the 5/8"" arbor hole so you need to have room to slide them on square with the arbor threads.

Practical Feedback:
This system works nice.  Pretty quiet for a dado and very clean, flat cuts.  I found the dial settings recommended in the manual to be only approximations. Adjust your settings and make notes for future reference.
On the negative (and its a significant point) I found I could not safely utilize the wider settings on this dado. When I installed the components required for a 3/4"" dado I found I couldn't even get a full turn of the arbor nut when tightening up everything.  ...and that still leaves one chipper in the box.  So, using this set for wider dados will require me to make two separate passes at different settings. (Seems like it kind of defeats the purpose of a dado, doesn't it?)

I don't know whether to place responsibility for this problem with Craftsman or Freud, but as a buyer it seems like a little more up front information would be helpful.

In summary, this is a great product if your tablesaw arbor threads are long enough to accept the unit(1-3/8"" or over).  If not, keep looking.

Just a followup note:  One of the primary benefits of these reviews is to alert other potential customers to salient issues.  Based upon the number of forum comments, it would seem that buying one of these, only to find they aren't fully functional on a specific table saw is not an uncommon issue.  When, as I did, customers consult point of purchase materials, Amazon promotional write-ups, and tablesaw manuals without finding any illumination on the topic, its probably a point others would like to know.  That said, I still think this Dado is excellent for those with the appropriate platform.",4.0
"As one reviewer has already noted, the dial a width dado by Freud is a bit of a challenge to tighten on the Dewalt 746 hybrid saw. But it is worth the hassel. You cannot use the supplied wrench, and your saw wrench will not fit either. I found that a big ol craftsman combo wrench works just fine to tighten the nut. The ""box"" end grips just enough to allow you to tighten the nut perfectly. It is worth the extra effort. This is absolutely the best dado I have ever used. Even cuts across grain in veneer plywood are clean and have no tearout, and dadoes cut in hardwoods are things of beauty. Adjustment of the cut is fast and easy, and if you keep a ""log"" of settings, you can return to a particular cut with confidence that it will duplicate the last cut. Hard to do with shims.
I haven't had the problem getting it sharpened as one reviewer has. I routinely take all new blades, bits, and cutters in to my local saw shop before I use them. I learned the hard way, new doesn't mean sharp. Their only comment was that it was a nicely balanced unit and has a good amount of carbide. Of course this shop has been in the same location for over 75 years, so they have probably seen it all.
I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5, because of the wrench problem. But as I said before the end product is really nice, so it is worth the little extra effort. Highly recommend this one.",4.0
"I bought this dado blade as the result of reading a review in a woodworking magazine.  I needed it to make about 300 dado cuts in plywood for a project that needed to be done quickly.  The blade made very clean cuts.  In fact, another woodworker saw the results and though I might have used a router since the cuts were so clean.  The bottoms of the cuts are flat and were fairly smooth.

The blade storage case is nice to have.  It comes with plastic spacers to separate the chippers and blades from one another when the blade is stored in the case.  These spacers are a little cumbersome to use and the blades had moved around in the case when I first opened the box.

The chippers are not labeled so I had to use calipers to figure out which chipper was which.  Once figured out the thickness of chipper and labeled the chippers with a permanent marker, the blades were easy to set up for the correct thickness using charts that came with the blade.  I was using 1 / 2"" plywood and set the width of the cut to 15/32"" and the width of the cut was perfect.  The blade included metal shims for fine-tuning the width of the cut, but I did not need them.

The blade also includes a DVD that shows how to use it.  I was able to use the blade without the DVD, but the videos were well done and contained useful reminders on how to use the blade safely.

One thing you'll need to use this blade is a new table saw insert.  I made a new one out of hardwood using a planer and bandsaw.  I then clamped  a dado sled on top of it and raised the blade into the insert, creating a zero clearance hole for the dado blade.  If you don't want to go to this trouble, you can always buy an insert.

This is an expensive dado set, but the results are excellent.  Since I plan to use it to make nice casework (and wood is expensive), it is worth the money.",4.0
"I have been building custom furniture for 30 year.  I have four different dado sets in my shop.  The Freud SD608 Dial-A-Dado is by far the cleanest cutting dado I have ever used.  The finished dado appears that it was cut with a straight router bit.  The bottom of the dado is so clean it requires no claen up.  The adjustment for narrowing or widening your cut slightly is a real time saver.  It works just as advertized.  If I only had one dado set to pick from the SD608, 8"" would be the one I would buy.",4.0
"The Freud Super Dado works exceptionally well once you figure out how to use it. And that's the rub. They send you a nice instructional DVD but it's for the pricier ""dial a width"" dado blade. After watching it, it provided absolutely nothing about how to use the blade I bought! Went to the enclosed booklet to set the blade up and it showed what sequencing of different sized spacer blades you needed to make specific width dado cuts. That was all well and good except the spacer blades are not marked in any way so you get to measure each one to figure out it's width. Surely Freud could mark the blades????? Finally, the case that the blades came in is cheap plastic with flimsy catches and a plastic insert that won't last and is certainly not worthy of a $200 set of blades. I am pleased with how the blade cuts so it's worth it. I am not pleased with the items noted above. I expected better of Freud.",4.0
I have owned this dado set for 3 years now and I have used it to cut many grooves and dados in lots of different materials with near perfect results.  When I first bought the blade I encoutered an issue regarding the mislabeling of the product.  No matter how many times I attempted to get the correct product from Freud they would never correct the problem.  I am keeping the blades but as a matter of principle I will never buy another Freud product again or recommend it to anybody.  I would rather spend the extra money and get courteous reliable service along with my product.,4.0
"I managed to get it put on by myself with no problems and everything fit well with one exception. The actually riser block didn't sit completely flush with the bottom half of the saw. It still tightened down securely and hasn't shown any rocking yet, but it is something I am going to have to keep an eye on since it rocked quite a bit before tightening the nut down. Other than that all the parts are quality goods and fit on perfectly. The saw is up and running, milling green hardwood logs better than ever even without a motor upgrade.",4.0
"I think it's hard to go wrong with a Freud blade.  I use this on a Ridgid R4512 table saw.  Great quality and clean cuts every time.

My chief complaint is that the chart they include that tells you which blades/spacers/chippers to use to get a certain width was not accurate.  I made test cuts according to their chart and measured with my calipers and the width was not accurate.  So I suggest building your own guide.  Just take a scrap piece of wood and use the different blades/spacers/chippers until you get the desired width.  Then record the configuration right on the wood next to the cut.

It's a lot of extra work to set up your own chart, but it's a necessity if you want to get accurate cuts.  For the price of these blades and the reputation of Freud, this is almost inexcusable.  Hopefully they'll get this fixed soon.",4.0

"I bought an older Jet 14"" bandsaw model WBS-14 used.  I called Jet and asked if this would fit my saw and they said it would NOT fit. I decided to take a chance and it does in fact fit.  The pins in the riser were a little tight, but everything fit without any modification.  The only issue is the riser is white and my older saw is blue.

"Bought this product hoping it might work for my Rockwell 14"" band saw.  Reading prior reviews helped me make the decision to spend the money not on a sure thing.

Would be better with two people  but being stubborn I did it alone with not to much problem.  All the other parts fit fine with a little filing and modification.  I do have a problem that has not been resolved.  With all saw blocks set out of the way, the blade can't be adjusted to ride on the top bearing.  It fits just a hair  the bearing.  Maybe I can move the riser block over slightly and provide more ""adjustability""?

I will give AMAZON 5 Stars for the return process and their outstanding customer service.  One of the reasons I am a repeat customer for so many things, is the consistent, high quality expierence.

"The casting and hardware in this kit are of the same or better quality as the band saw itself.  If you have the Jet 14"" band saw and need the additional cutting capacity, this kit is a great buy.

I bought this kit to modify a Porter-Cable 14"" saw and had a few (not unexpected) issues to resolve to make the kit work.  While the primary castings and riser castings for all brands of cast iron 14"" band saws are apparently from the same molds, the finishing details on different brands of band saws make the riser kits brand specific.  For example, the alignment pins on the Jet are in the southwest and northeast corners of the lower casting and the top of the riser casting, but the Porter-Cable has them in the southeast and northwest corners.  The blade guide post for the PC is about 1/32"" smaller than the Jet; fortunately, the thickness of the coat of black paint on the post is about 1/64"" so sanding off the paint made the post fit.

I also had to do several other modifications to make the kit work, but I did eventually succeed.

Bottom line:  if you do not have a Jet band saw, this kit may work for you, but it is not quite straightforward.",4.0
"I wanted to use the JRB-14 riser block on a Jet band saw (JBS-14MW) that is considered 'old' by most recent standards.  I bought the riser block kit knowing that some modifications might be necessary - and they were...

When I finally got the kit (it arrived quickly; sold and shipped by Woodcraft as purchased through Amazon) and dis-assembled the band saw upper arm, I discovered the alignment pins on the saw were at exact opposite corners of the new riser block.  I made paper templates of the mating surfaces of the existing castings, transferred the needed hole positions using the templates, and accurately drilled-out the new 1/4"" alignment holes in the castings to accommodate the differences in pin locations.  With a bit of ""adjustment"", I had the base casting, riser block, and upper arm well-aligned; installation of the new through bolt took less than a minute, as long as you have a helper to hold the arm in place while it is installed and while the nut is tightened.

The new (longer) blade guard was the correct length, however a mounting hole at one end of the casting needed to be filed-out to be able to fit over one of the two studs it is supported on.  This is a manufacturing/QC issue.  After I removed about 3/32"" of material to make it fit, the part installed as necessary (...at least the blade guard is made of metal and not plastic!).

The new upper-blade guide support rod is made from round stock as supplied in the riser block kit.  Some older band saws (as in my case) used a hex bar for this support arm, and I had to find a longer replacement that I made from hex bar stock, so I was not able to use the round bar that came with the kit.  The longer, adjustable blade guard that mounts onto the upper blade guide worked well with slight modifications of the screw slots.

Since the band saw I was restoring was re-painted ""tool gray"" in color, I also painted the riser block (and blade guard) before installing it; I painted the block after I had drilled the new alignment holes. If you are painting the riser block, I would recommend roughing the existing paint surface with steel wool and give it several surface cleanings with mineral spirits before spraying the paint.  (The surface of the block is a bit 'oily' as received.)

In conclusion, the riser block kit will work with older band saws as long as you are willing and able to do some modifications if necessary.  The re-conditioned saw works as a new saw would with the bonus of a 12"" cutting height capacity.",4.0
"I've only used one other stacked dado set before (brand unknown), and this set tops that one.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that the dado bottoms weren't totally smooth, and two of the carbide tips on the outside blades already cracked off after only a couple of uses (Probably a fluke - and the warranty should cover this - I plan on replacing my current set with the same make/model).  Even after careful setup, following the instructions as exact as possible, I still got lines in between the chippers and outside blades.  In all - the finish produced was good and I would definately recommend these to anyone looking for good, reasonably priced, stacked dado sets, but don't expect perfection.",4.0
"I have used DeWalts 12"" DW708 and Delta's Sidekick 10"" slide compound and the Hitachi 10 slide compound.  I have been building cabinets and doing a lot of finish carpentry for years.  What I like about the smaller Hitachi 8.5"", is that it does not have the ""head flex"" problem that some of these larger saws have when you slide them out on larger lumber or crown moulding.  I can flex most 10"" slide compounds almost 1/8"" when all the way out.  Most average consumers won't notice this.  But when you are cutting 5 and 6 inch crown all day and you want peices to fit like laser accuracy, you need something with STABILITY, this is more important than all the fancy features. And the smaller Hitachi cuts the most accurate ""crosscuts"" I have ever experienced, the other saws tend to ""kink"" under their own power and start making their own line as you cut.  If you want accuracy, BUY this saw.  If all you care about is a big fence, table, etc... buy something else.",4.0

"Contrary to previous reviews, this riser block is not fully compatible with the Ridgid 14"" bandsaw.  It ends up placing the upper wheel about 1/4 inch out of alignment with the lower wheel despite the block's alignment pins, blade guards, etc matching up very well for assembly.  The resulting setup will just work, but I sure wouldn't recommend it.  The blade ends up riding on the very outer edge of the lower wheel while centered on the top wheel.  You can't get the blade to really cut a straight kerf due to the slight twist this imparts, and the twist also messes up good guide block clearance.  I'm going to return the item if I can.  Why 4-stars -- because quality and fit of the product for a Jet user seems that it would be very good.  FYI, I'm a very experienced woodworker, have a well equiped shop, and am quite used to working on such equipment.",4.0

"Bought this believing it would fit the Rigid 1400 bandsaw and it did.  Once seated, you can see it is not an ""exact"" match as the riser is slightly different dimensions, but it does fit.

The guide assembly works fine but the material is a little flimsy on the blade guard.  I don't believe safety is compromised.  For the money, this deal is hard to beat.",4.0
"Based on the other reviews, I didn't think there would be a problem.  When I got my blade, I did a test cut.  I noticed that one of the chippers was slightly bigger (diameter) than the others based on the test cut.  The bad chipper cut a deeper groove within the dado and the bottom of that groove was a mess.  (Ripped out of the wood, not cut).  With the one exception, the dado cut was as described previously, glass smooth and perfectly sized.  Bad luck follows me but I'll try one more time because of what the other reviews have stated.",4.0
"This set comes nicely packaged (could have a better case) with good instructions and is quality, It makes beautiful cuts, however, I am reluctant to give it a full 5 stars because on softer woods and plywood, at lower speeds, it does chip/splinter, somewhat,(it says chip free). If you have a good motor on your saw with some good rpm's you should get no splintering (My old motor has beed rebuilt 2 times). In my opinon If you want a good dado for your money this is the one.

"Very nice addition to recreate the standard Jet bandsaw into something much more versatile, and price was great.  Amazon shipped really quickly even with Supersaver.  The instructions are generic for all the bandsaws in this stable (wood, metal, meat, Jet, Powermatic, etc.) and some of the instructions do not apply to the Jet.  Luckily Jet tech support is pretty easy to get on the phone.  Don't bother with the blade that comes in the kit--have your own on hand.  I followed Lonnie Bird's recommendations in The Bandsaw Book and have been delighted.

I installed the riser at the time I got the saw, so it was no problem as a one-man operation.  After reading the other comments I was surprised at this.  Given that this is my first bandsaw, it was really pretty simple except for the !?#&!!@*?! power switch relocation.  Would it be so hard to put a one sheet addendum into the box?  The guy at tech support was nice about it.

The thing that frustrates me about the finished product is that I have to readjust the cooling blocks if I change the height of the guide assembly significantly.  That is, the post doesn't move perpendicular to the table.  I've tried everything to look for something out of alignment but can't find it.

The ""maiden rip"" was a nice chunk of 8/4"" hard maple with a 50 tooth Freud combination blade.  The saw bogged only slightly...hardly noticeable.  I probably should have purchased a 24 or 40 tooth for ripping.
A couple people had advised me to get the Delta mobile base since it is a bit more stable...and I'm happy with it too.  The legs for the extension table needed to be mounted a couple inches inboard, but this was easy.  I was a little disappointed with the extension table.  It is made from a medium density fiberboard.  I think it should have been made from baltic birch or something more stable.
The one problem I noticed is that the fence cursor could not be adjusted far enough.  This was easily fixed by drilling and tapping two new holes on the front rail.  Otherwise the fence is great. Easy to adjust and smooth as glass.
Overall I gave the saw a 4, but really it is probably a 4.5.  It is definately the best bang for the buck and deserves a 5 for value.  I'd recommend the saw to anyone.",4.0
"I purchased one of these planes a few weeks ago. I was impressed by the smoothness of the moving mechanisms, and the sole appears to be of good quality. The cutting iron was not flat but I guess this is typical. It took some work to get it flat. I don't have a diamond sharpening stone so I was using sandpaper - pretty slow because I didn't want to use a heavy grit to get it down. Using various grades of wet/dry sandpaper I was able to get it nice and sharp. The sole was pretty flat, but it was cupped in the middle just a bit. I lapped it flat as well. While not as critical as other components, the cap iron left much to be desired. I was not at all pleased with the quality here. The edge that meets the cutting iron was not straight. It was all lumpy. I thought maybe it was just thick excess paint, but when I ground it flat with some rough sandpaper I had to go through the paint to the bare metal. It was a terrible casting. It wasn't too hard to make it flat, but I had to take off quite a bit of material before I had solid metal from edge to edge - it was that bad. You might want to open the box and inspect the plane before buying it. It is unbelievable that a so-called quality tool would have such a defect. Having said that, I must say that overall I am pleased with the tool. I knew it was going to take some tuning to make it worth using. It does a great job now. Very handy to have around. Don't expect it to perform well right out of the box.",4.0
"Stanley has been making planes for a long time. They do know what they are  doing. I have a few of these around for general purpose work . I also have  some Lie Nielsons and I love them but I keep them safe and out of reach of  others'. I don't care who uses the Stanleys. I know if they get ruined ,  I'm not out much. With a little tuning a stanley will do a respectable job.  Lap the sole and the iron ,put a good bevel on it and it will cut  aggressively or produce a fine shaving. The adjustable throat is a must for  avoiding tearout. I like the low angle version of this plane a little  better. It is easier to control .It also makes a finer cut. It won't cut as  deep however. To get a better plane you will have to spend at least twice  as much so this is not a bad deal.",4.0

"I am a 30 year carpenter of which the last 15 have been nothing but finish work. I had done some research on these biscuit joiners before buying the Makita. Great decision! This thing is so simple in design and function that the direction booklet is not even necessary. It's effortless! I jumped in full bore today. 8 six foot 1 by 4s of mahogany for a table top went together quite easily thanks to about 50 perfectly alligned biscuits. I don't bother with the dust bag so I can't really comment on that but what a sweet tool. The fence allignment was spot on and the cam lock height adjustment is so user friendly that it makes this tool fun to use.

I guess the only reason I did not give this tool a 5 is because the fence sort of shrouds the biscuit location marks on your project. It's not that big of a deal but you do have to extend your marks to about a half inch on each side of desired biscuit location.

The blade left very little tear-out and cut effortlessly! I have tried almost every biscuit joiner out there with the exception of the Lamello[WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!!] and all in all this one gets my vote for top tool for the price!

I would recommend this tool to all you journeymen as well as apprentices out there wondering which one. Trust me on this one guys!",4.0
I've had and used this for a few months now.  So far so good. I have never used other plate joiners so I can't compare it too well but at least using this one I'm able to get good joints with even my novice abilities.  As with any tool you have to pay attention to detail to get things right but at least I feel confident that this tool is of sufficient quality that I can produce high quality joints without undue effort.,4.0
"For the occasional & casual woodworker, works well for the money.  For the smoothest possible cuts or high volume constant use, an 8"" set with more teeth would be better.

The case is well designed. Saves you time, and saves the blades. The red plastic wing nut thingees both cracked, but Freud sent me new ones when asked.

It would be nice if the shims were factory labeled. You need to clean, measure, and mark them, and the marker writing eventually wears off.

I wasn't expecting this to be a fabulous plane for my first real plane at this price.  I was just looking for something that worked well and that's what I've gotten.  I'd been using some 5 dollar micro plane for a while for some small things and some things it was never meant to handle.  Just figured it was time to step into a real plane to properly handle larger jobs and to see if I really wanted to start going down the rabbit hole of plane ownership.  Keep in mind I did not go through the process many do of trying to make sure the plane was perfectly flat and and what not.  The sole seems to be flat to me.  no major problems with the machining.  I did give the blade a basic sharpening by hand and was making great shavings in no time.  This thing has found a permanent place in my regular tool tote.  I honestly can't believe I went as long as I did without a decent block plane.  I suppose the more I use it the more I will want to make sure it performs as well as it can so I will need to get some proper sharpening items and if i get really motivated I might see how flat the sole is and take care of that if it needs it.  Those seem like good skills to have for when a person steps up to a higher quality plane and they want their investment to perform at it's best.  The Stanley Sweetheart planes are looking nicer each day.,4.0
"This is a good setup, overall. Tearout in CDX plywood and hardwood is minimal; I haven't yet cut dadoes with it in birch plywood or any other expensive veneered lumber so I can't rate it in that area yet.

"if you are like me and not ready to spend [money]on a dado set, look no further.  this baby performs.  i chose the 6"" for my 10"" delta contractors saw. i believe this is wise to compensate for the lower horsepower of my saw.  a smaller blade will have more rpm's than an 8"" or 10"". its physics.  anyway, i like the case to keep it all organized and it comes with a handy guide that tells you what chippers and shims to use for certain cuts.  quite handy for undersized plywood.  big carbide tips that look like they will stand up to several sharpenings.

so why did i only give it 4 stars?  someone at freud  just got off break on friday just before quitting time and shorted me an 1/8"" chipper. Quality control cost ya a star Freud.",4.0
The width of the blade was a little wide and could not be inserted into the saber saw I have. But with a couple of passes with my surface grinder the blade was able to be utilized.

"I own somewhere around a dozen Bosch tools, from jig saws to cordless drills.  Every one of them shows a high degree of fit and finish, with good ergonomics and precise controls.
Although I like the performance of this router and will certainly get good use out of it, I was surprised that the fit and finish were not as I would have expected.  The adjustment knob is loose and sloppy, although the adjustment  seems to be pretty precise.
Someone else mentioned the lock-on button being recessed too much. While I agree it could protrude a little more, it does function.  If it sticks out too far, you could accidentally pop it on and surprise yourself.  But the button is too small for its recess and sits off to a side.  Plenty of room for dust  to get in.  Again, it was surprising to see this lack of tolerance on a Bosch router.
Other than that, the router itself just seemed to lack that polish and precision in plastic molding I see on all of my other Bosch tools.
I wonder if the economy and some leftover Skill engineers are taking their toll on Bosch standards?",4.0
"The saw was shipped in 6 boxes and was in good shape when it arrived. Assembly was relatively easy, We had a problem with the fence guide rail holes didn't match up on the front rail. Still waiting on a response from Tool Crib and JET. Everything else went very well. I give this saw 4 stars for the good quality workmanship and it went together like a dream, good assembly directions but need to be read more than once or twice to understand. Illustrations would be nice. Would be a 5 star saw but with the problem with saw it can't be.",4.0
"I purchased this saw mid-December.  It arrived within a week and the saw looked great.  Very little assembly required.  The rails were damaged, looked like a forklift had driven over them and flattened one end.  Called Amazon and they said they'd ship new rails from the Jet factory within 7-10 working days.  That was more than a month ago.  So, I can crosscut, but no fence yet.  The saw deserves 5 stars; poor parts replacement drops it to 4 stars.  Fit and finish are excellent; quality is obvious with every part of the saw.  I would buy again in a heartbeat, but probably from a local dealer so I can pick it up myself.",4.0
"I'm located a few miles from the Pacific Ocean, and was having a difficult time preventing rust from attacking my table saw, jointer, and planer even though I frequently applied silicone-free paste wax to the cast iron  surfaces.
I first used the ""Rust Free"" product to remove the  surface rust.  It's an acid solution, and caused a bit of irritation even  though I had plenty of ventilation.  My tools had only a very thin layer of  surface rust, and the product removed it effortlessly.  However, due to its  caustic nature, I think I'll go back to my old rust removal method of a  kerosene and a rag if I have to deal with similar conditions.  But if I'm  ever faced with more severe case of rust, I know what to use.
I then  sprayed a think layer of ""Boesheild T-9"" on the cast iron; left  it overnight; and wiped it off the next morning.  The excess was somewhat  difficult to remove --- very sticky and waxy.  But it was well worth it! I  haven't had a spot of rust on any of my tools in the three months since I  first applied the product.  I would have had to apply paste wax several  times during that time, and it's likely that a few spots of rust would  still show up.
I've only used the ""Blade & Bit"" product  once.  It easily removed the pitch buildup from my saw blade .  Like  ""Rust Free"", it's somewhat caustic and an irritant.  Use it with  good ventilation.  I think I'll stick with ""Simple Green"".",4.0
Very smooth motor. Soft start ramps router up to speed smoothly. Very good power. Do not really care for D handle routers. Thought I'd try it. Really just wanted the EVS motor from the router for my router table. Did not work to well in table as switch works only intermitately in table because of dust. Switch worked fine after blown out w/ compressed air. Milwaukee 5625-20 production router now resides underneath my benchdog router table. Well made router that gets a one staer demotion for faulty switch. Now motor gets used in my fixed base/plunge base 1617 kit when I need variable speed.,4.0
"I purchased this router on a recommendation of a fellow woodworker. Overall I am really satisfied with the router.  Do plan on adding a tiny bit of lube between the base and motor for smoother adjustments (thus only 4 stars).  Other than that,  the soft start is great.  Power is smooth and delivered.  And the D-Handle is a must have for safety reasons.  Even with one hand the router feels much safer than the knob versions out there.  The weight of the unit isn't too bad, so this one can be held for durations without issues...

This router is has a variable speed knob on the top making it yet even more useful.

"i was using this router for almost a yr now and it is quite nice, smooth, quite etc., as claimed by the salesmanship.

here are some (small) things to improve:
1. the locking botton in the D-handle is hard to operate because it is recessed too deep.
2. there is no locking mechanism for the shaft, so you need to use two wrenches.
3. a little light-bulb right next to the collet could be useful
4. there is too much play in the depth adjustment mechanism, so
the scale reading is useless.

"The adage holds true. It ain't fast because you probably need to sink a minimum of 2 hours into tuning. But good and cheap, for sure!  As others have stated, out if the box this plane is rough. If you do research on the net it seems that fully flattening the plane is not 100% necessary but it does make it look nicer. Milling the sides IMHO is for cosmetics. I think about 2-hours of hand sanding is what it takes to get the sole flat and smooth. Another 20 minutes on a 500, 1000, 6000 waterstone. After that I was able to enjoy the plane. Right out of the box I didn't even bother testing it.  For the money and the tiny bit of effort I can't see going wrong with this simple and easy plane.",4.0

Use the scary sharp method if you can. Buy a cheap pane of glass for a smooth surface. I used:

80 grit, 220 grit, 400 grit, 800 grit, 1500 and 2000 grit. The last two were automotive 'body' sandpaper.

You need to hone the sole, the blade, use a file to clean up the edges as much as possible, so on and so forth. I got a honing tool to make sure the blade was done properly.

Once sharpened, it works pretty damn well (tm). It probably needs to be a bit sharper, but I've been able to use it to get good, clean shavings so far. Good purchase, and has the adjustments that make it pretty useful.

First off I do not have tons of hand tool experience to make comparisons. Seems very solid pretty impressed with the fit and finish. I did put a straight edge to the sole and it had a bit of a crown to it. The center was high. So I spent about an hour in a half re-flattening the sole which was not to bad and expected for the price. The blade seemed pretty sharp I was getting nice wood shavings right out of the package. I was surprised to see it was made in Mexico but I guess a lot of American tool company's manufacturer over there. I wish I had a vertias but I feel confident that this plane will give me many many years of service.,4.0
"this one arrived about like all the others, bottom wasn't ready for use. Spent about an hour with 150 grit flint sand paper to get the bottom flat then finished it with 220 then 320 grits.  After sharpening I like the way it works now.",4.0
"Plan to spend an extended amount of time tuning this plane and sharpening the blade. I am operating on a very limited budget so I had to go with the cheaper route for my planes. I'll have the plane set up nicely when I'm finished with it, but it is a significant amount of work out of the box. The sole wasn't flat, the mouth wasn't square, the bed wasn't flat, the blade.... basically a butter knife, and it did take a good few hours to make it a decent tool. For a plane of this size, it wasn't a huge effort, but it is an effort and it is time spent tuning rather than time spent working wood.

If you can afford it, get the rabbiting block plane from a highly reputable name instead. If not, go ahead and get this one but don't cry when it takes you hours to get it into good shape.",4.0
"This is not the best quality but was fixable in about an hour.  First the front adjustment bolt weld was pretty shabby. Lots of flashing.  Filed down.  Then the japaning spilled into the front opening.  Had to make a jig and file throat and blade bed smooth and true. The base was warped  (cupped in the center)  Took a while but sandpaper took care of that.  Blade dull, sharpened.  One thing I can't fix is the two and 1/2 turns of play in the adjustment mechanism.  I'll have to get used to that. It actually looks like it is designed that way.  Doesn't much matter but shows a design that could use some improvement..  All told this is not what Stanley used to make but it has the basic design that makes it worth the twenty bucks or so after it is tuned up.  Would I buy again?  sure. for twenty bucks it is serviceable.",4.0

"I have used this glue for a number of projects, but it is a little difficult if you have a large area to spread glue on or a complex assembly to line up; it sets fairly quickly and gives you a very strong joint.
The biggest gripe I have is trying to clean up squeeze out, especially in inside corners.  A wet towel will pick it up if you work quickly, but that tends to spread a thin coat of glue on a wider area.  Scraping the wet glue up with a little shingle seems to work a little better.  After it is dry, the wood that has even the smallest amount of this glue on it will not take stain evenly.  The only solution is to sand or use a cabinet scraper to get to a layer with no glue.
Overall, this is a good, strong, versatile glue, but you should try to limit squeeze out to avoid cleanup problems.  If you are going to paint your project, it is no problem, but if you want a natural wood look, this looks unnatural.  I prefer polyurethane glues that do take stain (such as Gorilla, available on Amazon) when doing natural wood projects.  Polyurethanes are also better all weather glues.  They have a whole different set of quirks which I explained in my review of Gorilla Glue.",4.0
"This glue seems to be a staple amongst professional woodworkers.  I like the bottle design, which squirts the glue in a more controlled fashion and is easier to clean.  Here is my summary of pluses and minuses:
1.  This  glue is very strong.
2.  The glue sets very quickly, so you have less  working time.
3.  If you get a lot of squeeze-out, it's difficult to  clean the glue off the wood.  Heavy sanding is necessary to remove traces  of the glue.
But if you are careful, this glue pays off.",4.0

With a little tuning this plane performs nicely.  Sure you can buy much more expensive planes that will perform better out of the box but for the moderate user this plane is a great value.

"This is a solidly built block plane that will give you years of service once you spend a little time and tune it up right.  Nearly every plane made requires some fine adjustment out of the box so that should not be considered a negative when purchasing this item.
The cap iron may need a little lapping at the front bottom to fit smoothly against the plane iron.  The blade comes with a serviceable factory edge but I honed mine nonetheless.  Check the blade for flatness and lap the back if necessary.  The bottom of the plane should be checked for flat and the sides for square before you commit to using this on your finer projects.
Again, most planes need this kind of tuneup as they come out of the box.  The only fault I have with this plane is that the rear adjustment screw has a bit too much free play (a sixteenth of an inch) between the adjustment screw collar and the blade adjustment.  I fixed that by disassembling the mechanism and fitting a brass shim around it.",4.0

The only problem I have encountered is the small plastic glide for the locking mechanism is loose, sort of floating in the grease with no indication of where it is supposed to seat, and it falls out when I remove the fence.  The fence will not lock without it.  I have lost this glide before, but thankfully I found it.  It is a bit frustrating to have to put that thing back into position every time I put the rip fence on the rails.",4.0
Impossible to find parts available in stores.  So happy to have found exactly what we needed at a competitive price.  Nice selection of parts!,4.0
"these knives are ok. they don't last too long as they are only steel, not carbide. next time i would spend the xtra and get carbide ones. these knives go dull in just soft wood, as is expected from a steel knife. these delta knives are good for what they are.

go carbide.",4.0
"My complaint is not with the blade. It is a good blade for the money, but the Teflon ( DuPont or not ) hinders my rating. I was all set to buy this blade and called down to my local sharpening shop, who also sells Frued products. The guys there ( who have a  good reputation locally ) said not to bother with a Teflon coated blade. He recommended the Frued LU91M010 ( the same blade w/o the red Teflon coating ). He said that frquently he notices that alot of carpenters have sanded the  Teflon off around the arbor to keep it from slipping, and that uneven wear in the red Teflon is evidence of friction ( either because the blade is not true or the coating is not absolutely uniform) . Could be the saw he said, but not on as many as he has sharpened. The obvious side effect of of the uneven wear in the coating, is that likely that red coating is stuck to your trim & moldings. I was disappointed because I have come to appreciate Teflon coated router bits, but the pros usually know. I still bought Frued, it just isn't red.",4.0

"Was told this was the best wood glue out there. Not sure what to expect, just needed something to help make the wood furniture I assembled sturdier. As far as that goes, it did its job. Only complaint is that it's extremely runny and takes forever to dry. But my favourite glue on the planet is Tacky glue so I might be biased. Anyway, I didn't even use a lot and while waiting for it to dry, it seeped between the cracks of the furniture and got in the carpet so I'm working on a way to get it out. So of course, use newspaper if that's a concern for you... I was cocky and thought I could just wing it. Anyway the furniture seems more sturdy than without the glue. Might update with photos later if I find the time.",4.0
The negative hook angle does a nice job with no leading tear out. But the back tear out can be kind of bad. needed to be sharpened sooner than I would have thought. all i all a good blade. Freud is the best.,4.0
"I ordered this item approximately 1 month ago from Amazon and it was used but in very good condition. Very fast shipping and arrived in like new condition It had a minor bit of damage to the locking mechanism,possibly from someone trying to mount it to a third party saw. However it was a minor repair and I had it mounted and working within less than an hour. I also had to retrofit to another brand of saw but it went well and works great. I would definately recommend this item. It is well built,sturdy and atractive.",4.0

The plastic orifice is pretty clumpy. Otherwise it looks good!  The whole bag structure needs some strengthening. What about Aluminum rather than plastic? It will be a much more lasting product!.,4.0
