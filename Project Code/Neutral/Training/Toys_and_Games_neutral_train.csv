"Some parts were broken, had to return and send for a replacement",2.0
"I have sent an email to Discount Wheel Covers (where the mahjong sets came from) and have received no response.  In one of the mahjong sets, one of the pushers was broken, in fact the two pieces of the pusher were wrapped separately.  I have tried to glue it together, but it will not hold.",2.0
"I got a really cheap knock-off of a real pokemon center plush. the quality is terrible, though I do admit that there doesn't seem to be any stitching issues. The material feels super cheap, the tag is totally wrong and is on the bottom of the plush; even says made in China on the back! It isn't very well stuffed, and most definitely won't stand on it's own. I'm thinking it might be the place I ordered it from. I'm debating whether to put up with long waiting times and return it, or to just suck it up. Quite disappointed in the quality.

EDIT: Although I did not appreciate the low quality, I was able to contact the seller and they refunded me in full. They were pleasant to deal with, so I added another star. Though, it should be noted that the responses I got from the seller was very kind and understanding, and that kind of service is 5-star. I didn't even have to go through the hassle of sending the doll back, either. So, if you find that you may have gotten a low quality doll, please try contacting the seller first. It may be a more pleasant experience than being disappointed at the product.",2.0
"So after purchasing my glaceon plush, which was wonderful and in great condition, I thought I'd buy this espeon. I was super excited when it came in the mail, but when I opened it and examined it more thoroughly, one ear is longer than the other and the other is more rounded. The back of the head was sewn oddly and it has a butt-like shape to it. I thought it was legitimate until I compared the tags of the espeon to the glaceon, and the tags are clearly different, but they both came attached with the official pokemon center detachable tags. The espeon one here had a bad typo. ""Pokemon Ine."" ....""Ine"" they clearly meant inc.
Now I do have to say that they nearly got me, and I almost accepted the ""Oh this must be a bad copy of the rest"" until I realized otherwise.
Also the threads on the nose are a little loose.
Pretty unhappy with this purchase.
3/10",2.0
"The picture looks a little bit like it, but it's lays flat on a table. It cannot stand as shown in the picture. It's like a hand held doll only.",2.0
"The poor thing has no chin/neck, and oversized back hindquarters. It's just poorly designed overall. The plush is really soft and the colors are pretty great, but shape-wise it's lacking. The 2010 variant (this one is 2011) looks far more promising. I wanted this for my display rather than to be played, so the ugly head and face shape is unappealing for that purpose.",2.0
Looks like something my kid fishes out of the crain machines at an arcade or the consolation stuffed animal you win at a fair. I was expecting at least average quality.,2.0
"The plushie I received was not as good quality as the plushie in the product photo. It had loose strings, a blackened eye, and was lopsided and couldn't stand up straight.",2.0
"I will start off by saying that, the reason this is not a verified purchase from me, if it says that, is that it was given to me as a friend, and purchased off of my wish list.

THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL POKEMON PLUSH!!! I knew this originally, being that it was so cheap, but not everyone is so wise. It has no tags, and is made very poorly.

There is a reason this plush is less than $10. The craftsmanship leaves much to be desired. It does not stand up on its own, the seams were slightly pulled apart in the front (and unfinished on the neck) when I got it, and the head is extremely floppy. The dark blue spots on the side that you can see in the picture, on my product, are almost half covered by the yellow belly, which just shows haphazard workmanship and a lack of care for the product in general. The ears/horns are pretty odd looking- she looks more like the Dovahkiin than Lapras. The face is also really crooked, not quite as cute as it is in the picture.

The plush was also squished- yes, literally squished- into a box that was much, /much/ too small for it. Probably about 3 inches long and 1-2 inches tall. The plush is roughly 6 inches by 6 inches, so... Yeah. Forcibly crushing an item down to more than half the size it's supposed to be is going to cause it to get a little messed up in shipping. I assume that may be why the head is so unstable, but nonetheless- not great treatment of an item.

The item was ordered for me on June 5th, and it got to me on June 23rd. So about 2 1/2 weeks later, which I think is reasonable from a plush coming from Asia. Again, I just wish it would have been packaged with more care.

The material is soft, but that's really all the praise I have to say about this.

If you're getting it for a child, I'm sure they would love this all the same- but I'm an adult, and I like my plush toys to have a little bit of quality to them. Me giving this a 2/10 it being extremely generous.

Again! You get what you pay for.",2.0
Kept crashing and didn't work like it was supposed to.,2.0
"Was so excited to get the game and use it in school with the students I see for therapy BUT when it arrived.. I noticed ALL the people on the game in the pics are ALL white..no asian, Black, Latino looking kids..I work in Baltimore in a school that is 99% African American..I think I might return it unless I can think of a way to fix it but for that much money might not be worth it...I know the kids I work with will say right away that this is different and will be uncomfortable with that fact..please develop more diverse material",2.0
Very disappointing! Not worth the money. The concept is great but the instructions don't make sense and its not goal directed. No guidance to help people process through it. Absolutely no learning directive!! Very awkward to play. Its almost as if someone haphazardly made it in their basement or something.,2.0
Looked at it twice and instructions are not clear. There are tons on the same cards. I don't know it they are meant for groups. Definitely something I will have to take a lot of time to figure out. Hopefully it will not be too hard for the children.,2.0
"Its a good thing that I didn't buy these-a friend did. We both love Vocaloid, so she brought these over to my house one day. I was in shock of the bad quality.
First off, the paint job is probably the worst. Luka's hair is more a lavender than a cotton candy pink, Meiko's hair is blond (while Meiko Sakine's hair seemed alright) and the outfits were messy. Every one of these things had at least one problem with color or design.
Next, the figures structure. It was actually quite a riot when Kaito's pants fell off his body-my friend and i laughed so hard. His scarf also came off, and I wouldn't be surprised if eventually Miku's leeks also came off, as well as anything else the figures were holding. Nothing super glue can't fix, i guess...
All in all, I would be majorly disapppnted if I had bought these. Maybe some of them weren't that bad, but alltogether they weren't worth the cheap price.",2.0
"i should have payed more attention to the pictures, when i ordered these i thought they were going to be the nendoroids from the first picture but they in fact are not...i realized it after i got them in the mail. The ones you get are those in the second and third pic, they are clearly lower quality the colors are way off on some of them and the details aren't painted on them at all. I should have noticed (by the price) that they weren't the originals, but at less than $4 a piece ill simply paint the corrections myself. The ones in the first pic currently sell for around $25 each. You can compare the quality between the pics yourself, i was disappointed but i don't think my purchase was a total loss. after i repaint them they'll still look nice in my collection until i have the money to replace them with originals.",2.0
All of the poses are wrong. The paint job was very poorly done. Buy it if you are willing to retouch it.,2.0
These are fakes. Like the other posters said. I bought some authentic figures from Japan Town in San Francisco and the quality is completely different. Paint job is different too. My daughter doesn't seem to care and I just painted over the crapy paint job to fix it.,2.0
The Colouring was wrong. Half of them were keychains with no option to put them onto a stand. Not really worth buying to be honeset. Sorry.,2.0
"I got doubles instead of all 10 different figures and Meiko's hair was blonde. The figures are adorable, but I would have liked it better without the mess up.",2.0
Although these are exactly what my daughter wanted and she enjoys them very much they have all broken within days of having them. All of the heads broke off all of the dolls and she is not that rough with her toys.,2.0
"What you see is NOT what you get.  Yes, I received 10 mini figures, but not the 10 pictured. For the price I wasn't expecting miracles, but I did expect to get at least the characters listed in the description. When you order an item that is supposed to contain Rin and Len, you expect Len to be in the package.",2.0
There cheap ripe offs was not going to say any thing but there so poorly done I had to say it most of the characters and weong hair color like its hard to get the right paint or some thing and they can even color in the lines and end up with parts that have over color,2.0
"I bought them at a fairly decent price so I guess I should have expected them to be bad, just not this bad. In the description (which wasn't very clear to begin with) it said that they were made in china But very good quality. I beg to differ. They are crappy made versions of the nice versions of the figures in the picture. Most of their faces are crooked and my Miku append has a random black streak across her face that was on her when I took her out of the package. All of their colors are faded too. Luka's hair is so light pink that it looks almost white. I just wasn't impressed with them after the good things the seller said about them.",2.0
"The seller really needs to update the photo for this product. The actual product is lacking a lot of the detail in painting of the eyes, costume details, etc and the colors are off (for example Miku's hair is almost a forest green, Luka's hair is white instead of pink, and Haku is completely missing any purple in the costume. Also all the shading of the hair shown in the image doesn't exist). It make it seem as if these were knock-offs of the ones displayed in the image.",2.0
Way over priced.,2.0
"Nice car but mine was stop and go. Checked everything ... still no luck. So, I'm exchanging it for a new one.",2.0
Drove it around for about 5 minutes and the first time I hit reverse the car stopped and smoke began to roll out from under the body. The car was pretty cheap so im just ordering a new ESC. Pisses me off that it only lasted a few minutes though.,2.0
the front bumber  snapped and the esc failed the turning servo dosent have the power to fully turn the wheels then back all the way without still being in a turning position and the charger broke,2.0
Its ok drives great but remote started acting up,2.0
Frame broke in front within the 1st use,2.0
Doesn't have battery charger and is a cheap quality. Did not try yet cause it's a gift for my grandson this christmas.,2.0
Did not pair to the remote easily.  the instructions look to be translated to English using automated translation service and make no sense.,2.0
New to gas RC cars and the instructions with the car keep referring to the Exceed website for videos on engine break-in and other maintenance items.  The only thing is I looked everywhere on the web site and did not find the instructional videos.  Very dissatisfied with the limited information received.,2.0
We bought this for my stepson for Christmas.  We've never had an item like this before.  Instructions are minimal.  Tried contacting seller to find out how to operate and set up and got a next-to-nothing answer.  Needed to contact a hobby shop to figure out what all was needed to operate and proper instructions.  Very disappointed with lack of instruction and guidance.,2.0
"this is nice for the price i gess. but it brakes in bad ways. it brakes in the hard to fix places, and the ones that shouldnt brake. ive had mine for less than a week and is sending it back because it broke and you cant buy parts for it it at local hobby shops. exceed only sells stuff on amazon a another place or two, and it takes over a week for it to come in. so i would recamend spening $10-$20 more and buy a nicer one, thats what im doing. so over all this is not the best. oh... and parts of the frame are very flimsy if you hit it, like on the front suspention. im 14 and this was a lot of fun at fist, but not a good long term kind of thing.",2.0
"This some kind of joke right?
It fires one missile without crashing, and then refuses to fire any more missiles, and it just does a buzzing/jammed noise on its mounted gun.

After waiting 4 days for it to be shipped, the seller finally complies, and I'm happy that he finally agrees to mail it.
Now I recieve it and it flies quite nicely.
Very agile heli, very fun.

Of course.... the gun only works for 1 shot, and it will not shoot anymore. Its gun just buzzes lifelessly.
How did this product get past the testing/factory facility?

Oh well, I paid 20$ for this, I might as well try to enjoy it. At least it FLIES, so I somewhat got what I paid for, but losing the main gun feature is a total buzzkill.",2.0
"It was extremely fun, until it broke.  Don't know if the nephew was rough or it just broke...to be honest. But it is challenging and very fun",2.0
"I bought it for my 11 year old son to give him something more than just a flying copter (with the missiles). At first it flew pretty well and was relatively easy to control; the missiles worked well, too. Regrettably, after a couple of days it stopped lifting off. We got new batteries for the controller and made sure the copter was fully charged but on applying the throttle it would just dive to the ground or spin around on a table. Really disappointing for my son.",2.0
"I bought this to play with my five year-old daughter.  I tend to prefer games that can include more than two people, but I thought that this would be good for teaching some simple strategies.  Unfortunately, the game is just too boring.  While my daughter easily understood the game play, she and I both were done after just finding a couple of each others boats.  It just takes too long and doesn't compete with the many entertainment options.

As for construction, I will confirm other reviewer comments that the build quality is poor.  I remember that in my old game, the pegs would sit firmly in the holes.  Now, with a simple move of the board, pegs can fall down, causing you to lose your place.  They also don't sit well in the boat pieces.  I also received a number of crooked pieces, making them useless.

I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't be disappointed by this game.  You may get a few good rounds with it, but don't be surprised if it quickly ends up in the closet collecting dust.",2.0
"We grew up playing this classic game and encouraged this as a gift for our 7 year old.  He loves the concept and the play.  And we remember fondly the red and blue games of old.

But there are major issues with the build of this game.
Fit:  The pins don't all fit into the space allocated for them.  You can't properly close the units with all the pins.
Playing board - Bottom:  There is no ""floor"" under the pins.  If you try to play the game holding the units, or sitting them on your lap, you will push up any pins sticking through the floor of the unit.  Very annoying.
Playing board - Top:  The pins do not securely fit into their holes.  Any slight jostle will cause the pins to tumble out of their holes destroying any record of where you have fired and what ships you have sunk.

I also miss the 5 little holes in the old clasps of the old units.  We always placed red pins in the holes as visual bragging tags to remind our opponents how many ships we had sunk!  But that's not a functional issue, per se.

I recommend searching out the real classic units before investing in this ""updated"" version.  We'll be returning this one to the store.",2.0
"As a GenX, I grew up with Battleship and Electronic Battleship (cooler). Its a great game for young kids. 5 or 6 is about as young as you want to go on age. The kids have to learn both grid notation and also the transformation that their attack grid is an analog to my defense grip/ship grid and vice versa. It takes kids a little while to grasp this concept fully. The game is suspenseful and fun for kids.

The drawback with this version of Battleship is pretty common to a lot of products. The manufacturer has done a lot of cost reduction to the game since you saw the version you played on as a kid. There is a lightweight and cheap feel to it now. One example is the white/red pegs. They used to be large, about 2cm and solid. Now they are about 1/2 cm and hollow to save on plastic cost. Just one example, but you get the idea, everything about it has been spared down to the minimal possible costs. They even have the user apply the outside Battleship decal stickers to save on a few pennies of assembly cost. This sort of makes sense. They are selling the game based on nostalgia we all have for it that we want to pass on to our kids. This games sales driver is not word of mouth on high build quality or durability. Therefore, charge as much as possible and cut costs at every conceivable location. To this I would say to the manufacturer, shame on you guys.

A better bet would be to find an older battleship game with better quality on eBay or go dig up your old set from your parents basement. Those sets were built so well that they should still be fine.",2.0
cheap and potentially dangerous for children.  Everything about this is flimsy.  Best bet is to store you children's pens/markers and pencils so this get minimal use for food.  It should not be carried to school - you child will lose his/her food simply based on the thin construction and locking mechanism.  This item is purely a decoration.,2.0
The ad says PLENTY of space but this is NOT true.  It is actually a cheaply made piece of tin that is thin and wobbly,2.0
The top came bent and it never closed right.,2.0
"Bought two of these for my Grandkids. Removed the paper tab on the battery compartment, no sound. Bought $14 of new batteries installed and still no sound. Kids liked them but a cash register without noise ? Packing them up and returning them. I did call Learning Resources Customer Service, while they were polite, they had no insight as to their product's defect. Give this one, a DO NOT BUY!",2.0
"This is a very cute box.  However, it was smaller than anticipated and made of thin metal.  It was dented when received.",2.0
"Cute, but not sturdy. Handle is exceedingly flimsy. Not a functional product and I would not advise purchase if you intend to use it, only if you want to look at it.",2.0
"While this is a cute tin box (and I used it to hold mini-muffins at at baby shower), it isn't meant to be used.  Would look cute as a decoration in a baby's room or to hold all those crayon's for an older child.",2.0
Cheaply made. I could probably get one just like this on a claw machine for $1.,2.0
"Overall it's as expected but a major flaw I'm guessing is due to it being manufactured where the US dollar is not the currency.  The calculator does not automatically display totals as dollars.  Such as $4.20 displays as 4.2 which is terribly confusing for children.  You should fix that so that it displays 2 digits to the right of the decimal point.  As I said, confusing for children learning currency and not so much a ""Learning Resource"".",2.0
"This item was complete and in fair condition, however it Reeked of cigarette smoke that I couldn't make go away. Fortunately I'm not allergic, but there should be a warning attached!!",2.0
"Nice game.  Fortunately, I sort of remember how to play it from when I was a kid; the rules are frustratingly confusing and unclear.  If you try to play by following the printed rule sheet, you will run into many contingencies for which you will have to make up your own rules.",2.0
"Sad, cheaply made version of the original.",2.0
"I was hoping to get old version of the Trouble Game which showed better quality and presentation.  So, I was willing to pay more for old version.  I got new Trouble Game version instead (which is selling at cheaper price).  I was disappointed and cheated.  Please be aware.",2.0
This is just a peice of plastic that you pop onto a piece of cardboard.  Not the quality of the game I had as a kid. Junk.,2.0
"Classic game.... however the ""push"" part is SO STIFF that neither me or my 5 year old granddaughter can push it down to pop the dice. Very disappointed.",2.0
very low quality board,2.0
"The register looks nice and the kids enjoyed playing with it but after a few days, I happene to be sitting near my 21 month child while he played with the register (which really belongs to our 4yr old) and when he pressed the open button on the register a small screw popped out! He grabbed it and looked at it with curiousity. If I hadnt been there, maybe he would have ingested it! So why did this happen? The screw clearly looks like it separated from the plastic of the register. The register is a very hard brittle cheap plastic. I think this is why it happened with the register and with none of the other toys my kids have played with over the years.",2.0
Just basically a calculator with a drawer that opens,2.0
I was surprised at how cheap this felt when we opened it on Christmas. My daughter liked it but I expected better quality.,2.0
"not like the sturdy game of old, very flimsy",2.0
Although there are US coins and bills on the colored front of the box; there was definitely Canadian coins and bills on the inside of the cash register.  I am so glad I looked before giving it for Xmas.  My granddaughter is smart (of course) but she doesn't even know US money let alone Canadian coins and bills.  I sent it back and did not purchase another.,2.0
"The item is incomplete, it is missing the colorful piece that goes under the board, which tells you where home and start place are.",2.0
"This Mastermind game is very, very cheaply made - do not waste your money.  Spend a little bit more and buy the original (black and grey) in any store.",2.0
"Flimsy game, with an unprotected cardboard top that easily tears and wrinkles.  The old game was much more durable, though my kids liked some of the new twists in this version.",2.0
"As with most games, the new generation has build quality problems which distract from gameplay.",2.0
"Maybe it's just us, but we didn't find this game very challenging. The puzzles are of the ""you are in a house with an all southern exposure; a bear walks past a window, what colour is it?"" type. You move along a track. You answer questions from a card. If you succeed, you can roll a die for the number of spaces to move and then give the next player a try, or you can move one space and get another question. We played two teams of two. We never rolled the dice, and combined we only got one question wrong.
Oh, and to answer the puzzle, a house with an all southern exposure would have to be on the north pole, so the bear would be white.",2.0
"My children and I love this game, however,  the one I received did not work properly. We could not push the dice in the center without extreme force. Very disappointed.",2.0
Got this game and it's all cheap,2.0
"Great classic game, but the design on this version is cheap and does t hold the pieces very well, also didn't come with a box you can store the game in.",2.0
Delivery was on time but not made like the good old days.  Very cheap and flimsy.,2.0
"I would love to finally have this game again and I was so excited when it arrived in the mail, but it looks like someone beat it, and ran over it.....",2.0
"I love mastermind, butt his version is not great.  The lids don't stay closed and all the pegs spill out frequently.  the HUGE box doesn't make any sense for storing the game either.  I'm a bit disappointed",2.0
The quality was not great.  I would have been fine with the quality if it hadn't been $20.00.  I think it's worth 9 dollars not a penny more.  When it came it had a cardboard rather flimsy bottom that you attach to the clear plastic board and the popper was fine but a little sticky.  I felt I had paid too much considering how flimsy them bottom was.,2.0
"Disappointed! This came without all of the pieces. The small pegs were missing, so we had to send it back.",2.0
"It came to us dirty and beat up...they said it was in ""good"", like new condition....but it was NOT at all!",2.0
This game is amazing but the craftsmanship of the actual game is why I am giving it a low score. The little pocket on the side doesn't really fit all the little pieces. You can see that they skimped and changed this amazing game so much that it makes it hard to actually play the game. Kind of a shame - b/c I really like this game but we can transport it b/c of all the pieces not fitting into the compartment. I was going to buy it as a gift for all the birthday party my kids have to go too.,2.0
Make sure you verify which version you will receive before you place your order.  I received the newer version of the game that is VERY CHEAPLY made.  I searched to find the older one that's pictured.,2.0
"I just received this in the mail, and am so disappointed with the quality. I know it's not very expensive, but it couldn't have cost more than $3.00 to make. The box does not look like the picture here--it is white, generic-looking and is paper thin and flimsy, and I'm sure the game itself is cheap looking too. The box top does not lift off like you would think.  It is a Christmas present for my son, and he'll probably be fine with it, but what happened to the days when board games came in sturdy cardboard boxes that would last for years? Is there a specific company that still produces board games of quality material?",2.0
Game is fine if you know what you are playing.  But the version has changed over the years.  The reviews saying the current board has little quality are spot on.  That is the version you will get here even though the picture looks to be the Original version.  Very misleading if you are concerned about version as I was.,2.0
cheaply made... not a good product at all.,2.0
"Trouble used to be one of our favorite games to play with our children some 20+ years ago.  Our grandchildren were enjoying this game, but the game base is not attached, and the packaging is very flimsy and inadequate for storage.  I wish I had kept the old one!",2.0
"I would shop for better quality, but it may not exist.  Would not buy this one again. Nothing seems to made well these days.",2.0
"I got this toy for my daughter when she was somewhere between four and six months old, thinking she would love the colors, rattly sound, and movement of the tiny balls.  To my dismay, it turned out to be one of the least-used toys in our house.  She has barely ever played with it since I purchased it over a year and a half ago; though I can't offer any kind of good explanation as to why she never enjoyed this toy.  For some reason none of the Lamaze toys have ever greatly appealed to her.",2.0
"This toy is certainly good for getting babies attention, but the next response from my daughter was usually the protruding lower lip followed by crying!  It was way to loud for delicate infant ears.  As she got older, and wasn't so sensitive to the sound, she found it easy to hold and bring to her mouth, but still didn't like the noise it created when she shook it. She reached for any other toy in the vicinity besides this one.  I love the other Lamaze toys I bought for her, but this one sounded better in writing, than in reality!",2.0
"We purchased this as part of our classic Christmas - it's very cheaply put together.  The bubble pops, the pieces fit in their slot...but it's flimsy; even the box it is stored in is flimsy and not like other board game boxes.

Would not buy another - rather look for a vintage/ better made one.",2.0
"Was excited to add ""Trouble"" to our board game collection but this one was a disappointment.  Very cheap construction- honestly, it will be a game we play with just the family, will not bring it out with guests.  Tacky.",2.0
"So disappointed in this game. The quality is terrible. You have to push SO hard to get the die to pop and then it often doesn't even flip the dice, it just scoots it over. So flimsy.

I remember having fun with this game as a child, maybe a vintage version would be more fun and better made. Shame on Hasbro for making such a poorly made product.

However, when playing the game, it takes forever to get a game piece onto the playing field, and the game path is so short that most of the time your piece gets sent back to start because another player lands on the same space. We played this game as a family last night for 30 minutes without making any real progress toward finishing the game.  It was frustrating for my kids to just keep getting passed turn after turn because their ""guys"" were stuck in the start and they didn't roll a six.

Sorry is much more fun. Stick to Sorry.",2.0
Disappointed in how flimsy this product is - TROUBLE keeping the pegs in place.  Thought this would be a fun game for my grandbabies but it is more frustrating than anything.  Hasbro needs to redesign this product and then it would be a fun game.,2.0
"I returned it because it cost like $13 or $14, and it was put together so very cheaply. Can hardly push down the bubblmy 4 yr old g'son could not with 2 hands! Needs to be revised.",2.0
The storage area doesn't close well. I have to put a plastic bag around the whole board before storing it. I don't like the new peg colors. Great idea to revamp the board. Redesign it and I will buy it. Terrific game.,2.0
"The colors are bright, and it is eye catching, but my son was never interested for long.  We bought it when he was 2 mo and now he is almost 8 mo, and he never pays attention to it.  It is made from very hard plastic and is fairly large for tiny hands.  I am not sure if that's why he doesn't play with it.  It's not inviting to touch... just to look at.",2.0
"Based on the great reviews, I expected my children

(now ages 2 and 3) to love this toy.  However, neither one of them ever showed any interest in this toy.",2.0
"Awful version, I hate it.  First, the container that holds the pegs is not big enough so it is hard to close and keep pegs organized.  Second, and even worse, is that the four small holes that are used to help flag the correct and incorrect peg placements are configured as a square when the four pegs are in a row, so you spend your time constantly realigning in your mind how the two by two aligns to the one by four.  I miss the old version, just too pathetic to play on this one...  One extra star because this is a great game to play at dinner with my kid.",2.0
Again I am new to internet purchases. I did not review this before I bought. will not make that mistake again. The game was cheaply made. Paper backing with a warp frame.,2.0
"I love Lamaze toys but this rattle has never been high on my daughter's list of favorites. She really didn't show any interest in this toy until around 5 months and that was pretty much b/c she wanted something/anything to chew on and this fit the bill but her interest didn't last long. The rattle seems to startle her more than others - it is pretty loud. Also, it's hard to clean.",2.0
"The game itself is great, of course.  I have loved it since I was a kid.  This one, however is so poorly designed that it's difficult to play. The pieces can't stay separated and we have to keep the whole thing in a huge ziploc bag.  Every time you want to play, you start by organizing the pieces.  This is such an easy design fix--I can't believe this made it past whoever approved the final version.",2.0
This isn't the same as I remember as as child. The board is a flimsy plastic and the popper is kind of sad.,2.0
"This game was missing a piece, making it almost useless.  Only 3 players can play at at time because of this missing piece.  I will not be buying games from Amazon anymore because of this.",2.0
Love this classic game but the plastic is cheaply made.  The cover for the pieces compartment broke off in just a week.,2.0
"After reading some of the great reviews, I got this game as a gift for my step-brother in-law who is five years old.  I remember playing this when I was young and I had really enjoyed the popping dice.

The game arrived quickly, but several of the little plastic pieces came misshapen and deformed out of the box.  It appeared that the plastic was melted (they are very hard pieces of plastic, so this could not happen easily).  The game board also seemed very flimsy and cheap, like it will soon fall apart.  It felt too delicate for a child to really play with.  I am pretty sure the one I had growing up was a much better quality (it survived four crazy, wild, competitive siblings playing on it for years).

Because of the misshapen pieces only three people can play this game.  Altogether a great embarrassment for me, as I am sure it looks like I got my step-brother in-law a gift from a dollar store.

I recommend buying this game from another store with higher standards and easier in store returns; try Kids R Us or Target.",2.0
"Come on. Such a classic game. This has been around forever, yet the design of the tray to store the pegs is just plain dumb. There are small holes where pegs can get caught in them so the door doesn't close. The pegs don't stay in their compartments. just a plain poor design. Great game just try to find it elsewhere.",2.0
"There's nothing wrong with the actual product itself, it's just that I really don't like that faulty new design. The old one was much better and stayed put...with this one, you can easily knock over the board, the pegs can't fit in the peg holder so they spill everywhere and the part that blocks the code is pretty flimsy. I wish they hadn't changed the design of the game so much.

THE GAME ITSELF IS ENGAGING AND FUN, JUST HATE THE DESIGN OF THE NEW BOARD.",2.0
"This is a game that I have been playing since my childhood, and I love it..but this current piece is really flimsy. The big pegs don't all fit into the compartment and the side where the code goes does not lock, leading to any small movement of the board exposing the code! All in all, I would suggest buying the game but not this particular one.",2.0
It would've been better if we had received a complete set.  We were so excited to play and was disappointed to find that the bag of key pegs only had 1 peg inside.  Trying to find out if I can still get a bag sent to me to complete the set.  Item arrived on time.,2.0
Kinda cheap - storage doesn't keep all the small parts very secure.,2.0
"A great game in theory, but this new and improved version (vs. the old) is difficult to use. The gameboard is too big and it's difficult to get the code pins into their hiding place. We ended up buying two of the old versions at yard sales and now each set up a board so that we can both play at the same time.",2.0
"Cheap description yields a cheap product.  I bought this after playing at a friends house. They must have had a deluxe version as it was nice.  This one is much smaller, has a lot less cards and just feels cheap.  Read the descriptions closely or get what I got.",2.0
"The parts are all there, but it came without a box and is difficult for the little ones to keep up with.",2.0
"Love the game, loved the old version.  This game however is very poorly and cheaply made.  plastic is all low quality, and although I just got it, I can almost guarantee the flip top covers will be broken as soon as a kid gets a hold of it.  the pegs do not all fit in the peg holder.  the two compartments for the two different kinds of pegs is not fully closed so the pegs go between them, which means fishing the tiny pegs out of the bigger pegs.  would pay twice as much for a better made version if i could.
the pegs do fit in the holes though for me unlike other reviews.
also i wish they hadn't changed the colors to the pink, purple, teal, etc options, but that's preference I guess.",2.0
"I loved this game as a kid, but I always had to play it when my Dad was available to be the pattern police.  Now you can just play Mastermind solo on the computer or ipod, and get a new pattern and all your pattern clues without having to tie up someone else's time.  I hate to encourage electronics over a real 3D toy, but in this case it absolutely makes sense.  No parts to get lost that way, either.",2.0
"The game concept is good, and I'd heard it was very fun, but this version is made on the cheap. Extremely lightweight and flimsy, the base doesn't feel like it would survive an accidental drop. I might get an older copy that is more substantial, but I do not recommend this game.",2.0
"Mastermind the game is a good game, but Pressman makes the worst quality components of any game manufacturer, and this game is no exception.  The box is really flimsy and the colored pegs do not fit in the plastic container.  Better to find an electronic version since it works better as a 1 player game.",2.0
"A poorly conceived design.  The pieces do not fit inside the attached storage compartment. Buy someone else's design. Great game that teaches great logic...but why do we keep designing products that break, fall apart, do not store well, etc?!",2.0
Underwhelmed. I was thinking this was more like another cash register by the same company. I switched to this one because it was pink. Should have gotten the other one.,2.0
"The game was fine but I thought it was about $60 over priced as I paid $80 for a board game that others offered for $20. I thought I was getting some ""souped up"" version of the game, but I think I got ripped off instead.",2.0
I thought I was getting the original Stratego not one with wizards and dragons.  same concept though.,2.0
"I nearly bought this until I read that it involves cardboard and stickers.  That's shameful.

Search Amazon's partners and other major booksellers for the ""Nostalgia"" edition of Stratego.  It runs $4 or $5 more.  It has plastic pieces with metallic paint.

This game is a blast; you and your kids are going to play it a lot.",2.0
Disappointed with this cash register I bought for my grandson. The LCD solar powered screen arrived hanging lose in the registrar and there wasn't any way to get into it to fix the problem as the unit is sealed. Otherwise it's nice and chunky and looks fun if it worked!!Sending it back,2.0
"I've had similar models of this register in classrooms (Head Start Director) and typically love these products. So when my 4 year old son wanted this for Christmas, I was more than happy to oblige! Unfortunately, it's pretty awful. Unless the ""solar strip"" has a flashlight shining directly into it or the register is tilted towards the sky (light), the calculator doesn't work at all. Needless to say, this was a bust and my kids are pretty upset that it doesn't work, as am I.",2.0
"This is only getting a 2 because it worked for a short while before the drawer got stuck. It wouldn't close all the way. There was no rattle (there is now due to my trying to ""fix"" it). You can't unscrew the bottom and take it off to check. Taking the screw out does nothing. I followed directions as per customer service. My model doesn't have a reset button, so that didn't help. Changing the battery didn't help (in fact, it makes the same sad squeak it made before I changed it). Too short a life. At least the play money all works.",2.0
"Our little granddaughter likes it, but it doesn't work.  She would love if it would light up like it's supposed to.  They tried new batteries, but can't  get any of the window displays.  She can open the drawer & it pops open, but no number display.  I haven't seen it, but wonder is there a bulb that can be replaced to get it to light up?  Thank you",2.0
I thought the solar power would be great. It only works when in direct sunlight or when a flashlight is used. Not what I hoped for.,2.0
The drawer shoots out so strongly that it bounces some of the coins out of the drawer. Other than that we like it!,2.0
Awesome idea for pretend play but the buttons get stuck making it very difficult for my 7 year old to open the register.,2.0
The quality of this product is very bad. It looks so cheap. Its not worth the price. I bought this for a gift and I hated the quality.,2.0
Granddaughter loves this except when the solar panel can't collect enough light in the house to operate the calculator. Wish there was option for a battery.,2.0
"I bought this item August 2015, I had put aside for Christmas, when we opened gifts at that time, for whatever reason the cash register did not open, to date we still can't get it open, so I'm thinking my lost. The toy still looks brand new and packaged and unopened. :-(",2.0
No credit card !! it make my little son very disappointed. I have to return it and l hope get the new one!,2.0
"My 8 year old daughter like it, however the calculator stop working after 12 months.",2.0
Ordered the blue and red and revieved pink. My son doesn't want to return it now.,2.0
"This is a cute cash register for kids and the money is realistic looking. We are disappointed however that it arrived in a non- working condition. The included battery for the beep sounds was present, but the beeps didn't work when pressing keys. We replaced the battery and still no beeps. The calculator function works on solar power so it was fine. Disappointed because the grandkids would of liked the beeping sounds like a real cash register. We are not returning because it's too much of a hassle for a 30$ toy.",2.0
"The item delivered was not red and blue as pictured, but different shades of pink. The drawer pops out rather violently, which sends coins all over the place. Additionally, the paper money comes in 4 different denominations, but there are only slots for 3.",2.0
"I ordered this red/blue register for Christmas. It looked just like the register they use in my grand daughter's preschool The box clearly showed what I ordered however on Christmas morning a pink register was removed from that box and I was looking forward to the ""cha-ching"" sound when opening cash drawer. I want to exchange it for the one I actually ordered but my 5 year old grand daughter doesn't want me to take it from her",2.0
The idea was good.  It has helped with homeschooling and teaching how to count money back.  The calcalator didn't work from the begining. I was too late to return it.,2.0
This product did not ring or make any sounds. I returned this item.,2.0
"i have to say i am very disappointed from this product. i bought it twice, the first time, i have  received the wrong color, i sent it back which cost money and wasted my time, and ordered a new one, i received it yesterday, and it looks like someone used it before. in addition the battery is very weak and now i need to go buy a new battery for this. my son is waiting so long to get the right one and it's frustrating.",2.0
Cheap and flimsy. I bought this for my daughter ands it's a piece of junk. And Amazon won't let me return.,2.0
Stopped working after a few months,2.0
This might be a fine cash register if it worked!  I bought it for one of my grand daughters and she already had it.  I saved it for a younger one and gave it to her for her birthday.  The display does not work!  The battery was changed in case that was it and it still does not work.  I need to replace her gift but I'm not sure I want to take a chance on another one.,2.0
Too expensive for quality of cash register.,2.0
"Got as a Christmas gift. Broke less than 6 months later. Was very fun for the kids while it worked, but it just locked up and you can't open the drawer or run the calculator. Poor quality!!!",2.0
Batteries died in a week and have been unable to locate replacement battery's.,2.0
"This was great when we first got it. I was excited about the solar to power instead of lots of batteries. However, 4 months later, it's not working at all. The drawer opens but the display is dead. I've changed the small watch battery and even set it outside in the sun for a few hours thinking that maybe the light in the house wasn't strong enough. Nope. Maybe mine was a defective unit but it certainly wasn't abused or even played with to an exceptionally high degree in the 4 months that we had it.",2.0
It broke in first week. Very disappointed. Some parts on the electronic board must have broken - the toy does not make the beep sound any more when I press calculator buttons or when I swipe the card.,2.0
"The box had a large blemish on it so I'll have to replace it before giving it as a gift. Otherwise, the game is a classic and fun for preschool and early elementary school kids.",2.0
"Perhaps we introduced this game at the wrong time... but it failed miserably at our house.
The cards are oddly shaped, and not sturdy, so they got torn and bent (and lost) quickly.  No one seemed to enjoy playing the game, even after they understood the concept...",2.0
Idea is good but it didn't come with the coins. Didn't send it back because I didn't realize it until a few days later since my daughter opened it without me.,2.0
Too complicated,2.0
I'm not a fan of how the characters look. Seems sexualized. This is a children's game.,2.0
"Some friends of ours introduced us to this game and we loved it, so we purchased it for ourselves. We've played several games totaling maybe 9 or 10 hours and the cards look and feel like we have played with them for years. There are tiny black spots on the cards. The cards have also lost that ""sleek"" feeling of a new set of cards.

We love the game but the quality of the cards leave much to be desired.",2.0
"I like the idea of this game, bought it for my 7yo son. We played this once a couple months ago (he got it for Xmas) and haven't played it since. Kind of a lot of rules and the cards only stack up one way (they're shaped like a piece of bread so if you turn them 180 degrees they don't stack nice). Not a fan.",2.0
I think it is too garish and busy. I returned it and ordered the 65th anniversary edition.,2.0
The game is kind of cute but the shape of the cards makes holding them in your hand awkward and uncomfortable. It's even worse for little hands.,2.0
The solar power on this cash register is very weak. I would rather have to put in batteries.,2.0
"My 5 year old likes it but the cash drawer only opens every 10th time. If it opens you have to wiggle it and work with it to,get it open. Cheaply made!",2.0
Not nearly as fun as the other Gamewright games.  We own about 7 different ones.  Confusing directions.,2.0
Love the game however the box arrived broken which was very unfortunate as it was a gift.,2.0
This necklace is cute BUT the chain on the website is not the one I received.  Its a thin cheaper chain and literally broke the second day my daughter wore it.  I will be contacting the seller.  Also the pouch it came in was blue and not pink as stated.,2.0
I don't know why companies always feel the need to redesign things. The graphics on this game are really ugly. I purchased one about 8 years ago which had much cuter graphics. A classic game but this version is NOT,2.0
I wanted to original game. This is a remake,2.0
"Does my 4 year old like it?  Yes. Which is why it gets two stars. The game goes on FOREVER!  I'm not sure why there are not more complaints about this. The game could last 30 minutes, easily without some creative losing by an adult. I am all for a longer game, but that is not what I look for in a card game for kids. A strategy game, sure. This one is being hidden on the top shelf of the game closet.",2.0
"After recently purchasing Sleeping Queens and LOVING it, adults and kids included, I started looking into other card-based games, which are perfect for travel. I bought this one based on reviews and because I thought perhaps my 4-year old daugther could easily join in as well, and hid it to be a surprise for a recent vacation.

We played it once. It NEVER ends. Like literally, once you get down to two people, I cannot see any way this game ever ends. And that sucks. Really, my daughter and I were the last two left, and ended up playing for 20 minutes after everyone else had left, eventually deciding to end and eat ice cream. Such a boring game in general, and it goes on and on and on.

Get Sleeping Queens.",2.0
"We bought this in 2012 for christmas. It stopped working by christmas 2014 and was only used by two kids at our home and not even that often. I checked and changed the battery, tried the factory reset. No luck. Based on the longevity of this product I would not recommend it.

***update. I contacted the company and followed their suggestions and still could not get it to work. They have offered a one time replacement of the cash register.***",2.0
"I purchased the World of Sweets version, but the game that came was not the version pictured- it was the cheaper, flimsier version. I specifically didn't want the cheaper version due to the reviews that indicated it was poor quality.  I had to send the game back- fortunately Amazon makes it very easy to do so.  I'll probably try to buy this in the store, where I can make sure I am getting the right version.",2.0
The game isn't the same as the version we wanted to replace.,2.0
"I like the previous versions more.  It's difficult to see the names of the item on the cards when holding 9-10 cards in one hand.  We may get used to it overtime. But love this game, gets the entire family involved!",2.0
"I purchased this item based on reviews and the rewards that it has won expecting it to be a family hit. What a disapointment! Obviously I am in the minority for not enjoying this game but it has caused more fights and arguments between my kids than it is worth. My family (kids age 9, 7 and 6) plays a lot of board games so it's not like we don't play well together. But this game requires everyone to flip their card over the same way, yell the correct phrase (Stop Thief, Double Decker, or Sandwich) and slap at the right time. It definetly requires a referee, which is not what I want to be doing during family fun time. I've heard more ""that's not fair"" or ""he looked"" complaints while playing this and it's just not worth it. I must be missing something because so many people love it and rave about the laughter it creates. Not in this house!",2.0
This was nice but if you don't have a lot of lights on you can't see the numbers,2.0
"Update: The fact that the cash register is really a calculator was confusing to a 9 year-old in addition to my 6 year-old.  The older girl is well into learning money, and she was expecting a real cash register readout.

I echo other reviewers who say the readout is difficult to see.  The contrast is so low that it is hard to see in regular room light.  This is a big deal when you're looking for the decimal point.  ""1.5"" looks like ""15""  This really frustrated the girls because they were trying to add up the purchases.

My 6 year-old daughter really likes the actual-sized money and large buttons on the register, but the fact that the register is really a calculator is confusing at times when it comes to dealing with money.  For instance, $4.50 reads on the calculator as 4.5 - not how we usually represent money.  Also, to give change back, you either have to start with what the customer gives you and then re-enter the total or hit the ""-"" sign and ignore or explain the negative number.  For instance, if the total comes to $4.50 and you give a $5 bill, the total will read 4.5.  To make change, you either have to clear the total and enter ""5 - 4.5"" or start with the total and enter ""- 5"".

Had I realized the implications of having a calculator rather than $ notation to a 6 year-old, I would have chosen a different cash register that always displays 2 decimal points (4.50 instead of 4.5) and allows you to make change more easily.  I believe there's another Learning Resources cash register that does this.",2.0
"This was a Christmas present and it worked well when it was in our bright and sunny living room on Christmas day. Once we took it to the downstairs playroom it doesn't work because it is solar powered. Our playroom has a few windows and bright lighting, but this has to be directly under one of the overhead lights for the digital display to work. I assume lots of people hope to use this in a basement playroom.",2.0
"The number buttons don't work at all. We thought maybe it just needed to be charged in the light with some solar power, but they still didn't work after sitting out for hours. Very disappointed as this was a Christmas gift for my 5 year old.",2.0
"If you buy this thinking the board would be like the 1950's style, you'll be disappointed.  The board has SO MUCH stuff on it, such a busy pattern, that it's almost annoying and stressful.  Probably going to sell it, and buy a vintage Candy Land game.",2.0
"Size of money and coins is great, but it is not working after 1 day of use.  The calculator is suppose to be solar powered and it is already not working.",2.0
"Definitely not the same quality as when I was a kid. The people are very flimsy, thin cardboard, and the spinner broke after one use.",2.0
played it once.  nobody got into it.,2.0
"Worst packaging I've ever seen. Cards are weak, and get marked in the first play. Everyone knows the bear. To top it off, the cards pretty much do not go back in the box. Card quality and preservation of it is EVERYTHING in this game.",2.0
This came with a weird strong cheese smell that wouldn't go away.,2.0
"Nowhere near as good as original. The art on the board is highly distracting, the spaces where the chutes/ladders start and end are overlapping making it tricky to tell what space you are in.  Besides the poor graphic design, the message each ""ladder/chute"" tells a child is terrible!!  If you are carrying dishes (to a child is a helpful idea) ends up in a broken mess at the bottom of the chute. If you are reading books at the top of the slide (also a great thing for a child) you are bored at the bottom of the chute. The scenarios go on like this.  My 3 1/2 yr old was perplexed by the scenarios and stopped playing after reaching space 21.  She normally LOVES games ( Busytown, Busy Airport, Mystery Garden, Dominoes, Sneaky Snaky Squirrel, Racoon Rumpus, Hoppy Floppy Bunny, Deep Dark Woods...)",2.0
Cheaply made.,2.0
The solar powered calculator only works in a light is shining right one it.,2.0
"It's fine, but I would have preferred the classic or vintage version. I guess it's just a preference based on what I grew up with.",2.0
The board is hard to follow. It's set up like a checker board and you have to zig- zag across the board. A lot of the squares are hard for my kid to notice because of how they are covered by the chutes and ladders.,2.0
Find the original version. Very busy game,2.0
This is a great idea but poorly executed.  This is my replacement register and unfortunately the second one doesnt work either.  I really hoped I would luck out because I really like this toy and so do my girls but I would have been off with one without the bells and whistles.  I am not one to buy electronic toys but this one seemed so neat and educational.  :(  Neither of the screens worked.  The first never did.  The second within a month was blank.  Bummed.,2.0
"Meh, we bought a Candy Land about 10 years ago and it was pretty torn up, so I bought this.  I like the vertical board better, but the characters are not so great.  The pirate looks really evil, the lady is barely dressed. This is for kids? Come on!",2.0
I am why do make it fany for classic Chutes and Ladders game. I did not like the fact that it doesn't have the dices. The spinning wheel gets annoying. Its harder for my 4 year old to spin the wheel. I would rather have dice.  Also the card board characters which act as your chip are way too big. Don't see the point. But I think Hasbro's effort to make this classic game fancy is all wrong.,2.0
"I'm not sure if I'm basing my review off the fact that my kid drives me nuts when we play or if the game actually deserves 2 stars. My son is almost 5, and this game board is ridiculous. The green color for each space is too similar, and if your kid doesn't recognize numbers past 20, you're screwed. My son is smart, can count, recognizes numbers, but after playing more than a dozen times, I have to close the board before finishing because he can't do it on his own. He plays dumb and goes ""which way do I go? This way? Up here? How many is 5?"" I just can't deal with it. Fix the game board.",2.0
"Shame on you hasboro. I loved this game 30 years ago. I couldn't wait to play with my daughter, just shy of 4. This was terrible. Entirely too busy, she had no clue where to go ever. What a horrid remake. I'll be returning tomorrow. And emailing hasboro bc I'm just that mad",2.0
"My 3 year old was very excited to get this as a gift but within 20 minutes of playing with it the beeping noise that occurs when you use the toy credit card stopped working. I was hopping that they had just put a short-life battery in and I put in a replacement but it didn't work. It's pretty disappointing since that part was very exciting for my daughter. Breaking within 20 minutes of use, (and I was with her the whole time, she didn't slam it) constitutes ""junk"" in my book.",2.0
"I tried playing this with my 3-year old niece, who is good at counting. The concept was clear enough. What we had trouble with was the design. It was hard to tell whether you were supposed to move your piece to the right or to the left, because the board was cluttered and the numbers weren't easy to read. That made it difficult enough for me, as an adult, to figure out which way to go, but my niece was totally unable to move her own piece, which made it boring for her. So she moved whatever direction she wanted- up, down, left, right. The spinner was good, although my niece kept wanting to spin it multiple times, so we instated the rule that only the first spin counts. But the biggest, dumbest design flaw is the huge game pieces. Each of the four player pieces sits on a big round plastic base that covers an entire square. Two players may frequently end up needing to be on the same space, but that is physically impossible with these pieces. I'll be altering the game, or maybe just making a new one from scratch, unless I find an older version somewhere.",2.0
Had very strong chemical smell. Sharp corners and blocks are smaller than they appear,2.0
I bought the deluxe edition...no bell...I feel like I was lied to.  I'd suggest someplace else.  They won't do anything about it either.  im usually happy with amazon but this is disappointing.,2.0
"I originally really liked these blocks upon unboxing, they look nice and have rich color. However, when I washed them before giving them to my daughter I noticed they were already starting to flake off small pieces of color. I know a little bit of this is normal for painted wood toys, so I put them with the rest of the toys.

They've been in play for only one month now and several of them have terrible flaking off of paint AND wood. Severe enough that I can no longer comfortably allow my daughter to play with them since she still puts toys in her mouth, so I have taken them away and will be selling them in a garage sale.

I've attached photos...this level of damage is not the norm for other painted wooden toys that I've seen, so I'm very disappointed in the quality! Otherwise it's a pretty set that my daughter would have enjoyed.",2.0
rectangles good luck stacking em.,2.0
"I liked this game as child and don't remember it being so hard to sort out the visuals on the board.
The newer design, as many have commented, is confusing and not just for the kids.

The beginning/end of the ladders/chutes barely take up their respective spaces making it difficult to know when a special move must be made.

The overall graphics are too cartoonish and cause the board to be too busy. Maybe the 3D and shadows add to this.

While the ladders & chutes take up too little of the square, the graphics of the kids take up almost the whole space, distracting from the ladder/chute. Many of these even cross over to adjacent squares.

It is confusing to follow which direction to move in each row. I don't remember how earlier board designs made it easier but it wasn't this hard to follow for me as a kid.

The playing pieces seem too big and the bases to the pieces are definitely too large, taking up almost all of the square.

The spinner is cheap cardboard and warps even if nothing has been spilled on it. The arrow end is too long, often covering up the number it lands on.

My suggestion, find an earlier design of this classic (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chutes-and-Ladders-Deluxe-Board-Game-in-Classic-Nostalgia-Collector-s-Tin/dp/B0065MNS5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chutes and Ladders Deluxe Board Game in Classic Nostalgia Collector's Tin</a>) or snag one at a garage sale.",2.0
"The frosty fairy has been remade since we were children. She looks like an over sexualized Bratz Doll now. Very disappointing. Other than that, the game was fine.",2.0
This was advertised as the old version but it's the new one.,2.0
"I adored playing Shoots and Ladders when I was a kid. I was excited to buy this game for my children, but I have been so disappointed in the new version. It is so incredibly frustrating to coach my 3 1/2 and 4 year old sons through this game, that we rarely finish it before I announce we're done and ask them to select a new game.

Shoots and Ladders is supposed to teach number recognition, counting, and lessons about right and wrong. As another reviewer pointed out, the new game board is too crammed to do any of that. I spend each of my children's turns saying, ""Your piece was on that block. You bumped it."" The squares are so small, their tiny hands cannot navigate placing the piece in the correct spot. Then I have to say, ""Okay, start counting each box. You're moving toward me/away from me."" Next they get frustrated because they can't see the boxes. They alternate light blue and white, and there's a cartoon image, chute, or ladder covering 90% of the board, meaning small people cannot see the so-called ""boxes."" Then, they'll reach the end of a row, and I have prompt them to look at the arrow. The giant arrow leads both of them to believe they should go up the board, rather than back and forth across the rows. I have to remind them of this over and over. My four year old (almost five year old) has said, ""This is confusing. How do I know where to go? How can I see the numbers?"" Bottom line, the board is very poorly designed. It leaves me feeling over-stimulated, so I cannot imagine what my boys' little brains are going through trying to make sense of the chaos.

Someone else pointed out the spinner is poorly designed too. The arrow is so large, it covers the number it lands upon. That's just one of those ""duh"" things. What a ridiculous design!

And then there are the little people/tokens representing each player. Cardboard rammed into a piece of plastic over and over again each time the game is assembled?! Come on! These are preschoolers! One of our tokens was bent on the first assembly, because kids this age want to do the assembly themselves. I let him try. He bent the piece. He was upset. Oh well, we move on with one bent piece and three that I hastily put together so we could get going. After several times taking them apart and reassembling, they are junk. And you can't leave them assembled if you want to close the box top! Really?!?

And finally... the average playing time to actually finish this game with two preschoolers playing? I'd say it's right at 30 to 40 minutes, and that's if someone is coaching them the entire time. We usually make it about 10 minutes before one of us is so frustrated we just give up.

I would gladly spend twice the money to get a version of this game that didn't make me absolutely nuts. Why didn't I keep my game board from 30 years ago?!",2.0
The images on this game board are shrunken down so small it's difficult to look at! They should have used a larger board or simpler graphics.,2.0
"I ordered this for my young children, reflecting nostalgically on my own childhood during which I would sit in front of this game board and play with the pieces for what seemed like hours. I was hoping for the same experience for them. Unfortunately they've remade the game where it now reflects that chaotic scenes in children's television programming. The game board is smaller, super crowded, and way too busy. It was difficult to even follow the colored road! I felt overstimulated just glancing at the board. It was really disappointing.",2.0
"I don't understand why, but this game has changed since I was a kid. The concept and game play is the same, but the board is terribly laid out. My young children cannot figure out which direction to go, and frankly, I have to look very carefully in order to help her. The game takes a long time to play, and often we get confused about direction and such, because the board is so busy and cluttered. I think Chutes and Ladders could use another revamp. I wish it was easier to play, like the version I remember from my own childhood.",2.0
"As other reviewers have said, this version of the game is very poorly designed.  It's flaws make me curse this game every time my children ask me to play---if I could only find a simple gameboard from when I was a kid, we'd be fine.  The game pieces are actually larger than the squares they travel on, which is very frustrating.  The board is cluttered with unnecessarily large graphics, which make it very difficult for young players to see where they need to move.  The slides and ladders overlap each other in several places, and obscure the numbered spaces, so often children cannot tell which way on the board to move.  Skip this game, and save your sanity!",2.0
The game board for this version of Chutes and Ladders is so busy and cluttered with graphics that it's hard to follow - even for an adult - much less a 3 year old. The direction of play is hard to figure out and all of the little pictures are unnecessary. My advice is to take all kid pics out and clean up the board. Remember this is for TINY KIDS - they are just learning the basics of playing board games. It needs to be clean and easy above all for this age!,2.0
"Games should be fun, but this one just is not. Not for me (no biggie), and not for my 4-yr-old. The numbers are difficult to read, the path is hard to follow, the graphics are too big and the colors are not great. My son can play Candyland and Cooties game after game after game, but he often wants to stop before completing even one, long, tedious round. Too bad - the older versions were more fun!",2.0
It's so busy you can barely find the road.  I like the old candyland and bought it on ebay.,2.0
"This version is different than the one I grew up playing. It is much ""busier"" and cluttered than the older version. My 3 year old has played the older version and this version and has difficulty navigating this version.",2.0
"The cardboard spinner broke after a few plays, so we had to improvise and use a paper clip.  I guess it teaches kids to count, but my kids lost interest in it pretty fast.  all they want to do is argue over who gets which character.  the gameplay is simple but maybe a little too simple.",2.0
"To begin the packaging/shipping was perfect.  There was no damage and was deliver on time.  The game itself as you can see from the picture is not like the original.  This to me was no big deal at first until we started playing the game with our 3 year old daughter.  The board is riddled with confusion constantly guessing which direction you need to be going do to the lack of indication.  The player pieces are extremely large thus causing trouble for players to share a space.  If 3 land on the same spot, forget it just put the others in the middle of the board or suffer frustration.  The spinner works well enough to get the job done and there really isn't much more to say about this product other than make every effort to find the older version or at least a different one from this.  :D Hope this helped!",2.0
"I don't know if the board has changed, but as a parent of a 4 year old, I hate playing this.  The board is like a big grid and my son gets confused as to which way he's headed.  The spaces have numbers on them, but even I have to look at which row I'm in and when he turns a corner he thinks he's supposed to go up.  I do like that the slides and ladders have pictures of rewards or punishments. We have more fun talking about the pictures than moving our pieces.  My last complaint is how long it takes to finish a game.  I feel guilty not playing it more often, but we just don't enjoy it.",2.0
"I bought this for my son as a first game, and I've played it with him, as well as his younger sister, who is now 4 years old.  I cringe every time they want to play this game.  The board is so busy looking, and the slides cover squares that you need to count as you land on or pass by.  It's confusing to kids about which way they're to go on the board (first they go left, then they go up, then they go right, etc.)  I constantly have to help them count squares that are covered over by the slides, et al, tell them which direction to go, etc.  This is not one of the best counting games out there.  Try Hi Ho Cherry-O.  MUCH better game!",2.0
"I just played this game with my oldest son who is 6.  I felt like we had fallen into in infinite time loop anomaly, and a boring one at that.

Where to start?

First, there's the cheesy cardboard gender specific pieces, and if you have a combination of genders not supported by the pieces, tough.  Why not just do something colorful and abstract like other games.  Add to that the cardboard stand-up pieces are too tall and continually falling over and getting in the way when opponents are continualy passing each other and landing on the same squares as they are continually reaching for that magic 100 and getting sent down a slide to oblivion only to begin the process again.

Then there's the infinite and tedious gameplay.  Move in straight lines back and forth on a mostly featureless board counting up to 100 as you spin a spinner and hope against hope that you get to climb a ladder and avoide a ""chute"" (which is actually a slide).

I suppose it's great if you want to teach a child to count to 100 and keep playing at reaching a goal no matter how much bad luck befalls him or her, but Candyland can do that (well, not the 100 part but the goal part, and the kids don't need to know how to count to 100) and it's a lot more fun.

The other adults (my wife and a friend) that I mention this game to both remember playing it as a child and changing the rules just so the game will finally end.  So, what's the point in this game?

Seriously, this game might have been great in its day, whenever that was, but you've got a lot more options now.  Those kids don't stay little and cute forever, so why not buy a geniunely fun game to play with them?",2.0
"Right out of the box, my daughter dropped one of the blocks and a one inch piece with a sharp point on one end broke off. I've been watching carefully for any other issues, but so far it's just the one block that seems to be defective. She loves them, but it makes me nervous that she might try eating a sliver of wood if it happens again.",2.0
smaller than advertised,2.0
"I know this is a ""classic"" but in this version my almost 5 year old son (and myself actually) have trouble following the track.  You move from left to right and then when you get to the end of the row you move up one space and then move right to left then on the next row you do the opposite again.  The spaces are numbered but it is hard to read and my son obviously cannot follow the higher numbers.  So you end up going one way and then you slide down and you have to go the other way.  It is frustrating for us because we end up getting confused and having to redo the turn because we went the wrong way.

The ""water color"" pictures are nice but it is sometimes hard to tell where you are supposed to be.

Candyland is much clearer in this sense and my son has a lot of fun with that one.",2.0
Did not get what the picture shows. I was looking for the orginal board game. This one is like a futuristic candyland.,2.0
Wooden storage box came broken and we have had to get a different storage box.,2.0
These blocks are a lot smaller than I was expecting,2.0
Blocks were very small.  I thought I ordered the Jumbo blocks.,2.0
it is looks good but the  chemistry smell is not good. Also the painting is also coarse-grained.,2.0
Really small.,2.0
My grand daughter enjoys it but I was very disappointed that it had spots that won't erase.,2.0
We got these as a gift for my one year old's birthday. These smell SO STRONGLY of chemicals! Since they're made in China I'm rather concerned about my child to putting these in her mouth.,2.0
"They were smaller than I anticipated.  Otherwise, they are fine for small children.  The picture of their size is misleading.",2.0
"These Larger Size Blocks are a Nice Size But LACKING QUALITY CONTROL. The Paint is Missing on A lot of the blocks & they are giving off a Bad Chemical Smell on top of that. I Would Not Let Kids Play with these right away, AIR THEM OUT FIRST. I Bought these for my photography with kids and hoped to add another two sets to my Prop box But I Will Not Be Buying Any More. I hope I didn't just waste my money, these are made in China too. I Hope this feedback Helps. Truly Gerard",2.0
This board isn't like candyland from my childhood. There are so busy with too many pictures and graphics that the trail is hard for my daughter to see and follow.  I managed to dig up an older version which is much easier for her to play.,2.0
"My daughter received these blocks for her 1st birthday. The word ""elephant"" is spelled ""elerhant"".  How are we to teach our children anything when their toys are misspelled?",2.0
I thought these would be great for our 15 month old daughter but they were way to small.  She couldn't stack them because they became lost in her hand!,2.0
"This game is sadistic. I'm fairly sure that is does more to desensitize players to death than to actually inspire us become surgeons when we grow up.

The buzzer haunts my dream at night. That said, if it needs to exist then it should be the classic version without any ""new"" or ""updated"" pieces.",2.0
It is always so sad when you order something that you remember from your youth and then it comes and it seems so much less.  Super cute but very flimsy etc... We did keep it and played it (once) but probably would not recommend. (sorry),2.0
Flimsy. Cheaply made.,2.0
"Although I like the layout of this toy, my grandchild won't play with it. That's because the first time he pushed the open button, the drawer shot out with a loud whoosh and hit him in the stomach (it was on a table). If he would have been shorter, it would have hit him in the face. The drawer is on some kind of intense spring-loaded system, and shoots out with force. Might be OK for older kids, with a warning of what's going to happen. But it's dangerous for 3 year olds and under.",2.0
"Disapointing !After just a few uses the calculator does not work. Also sometimes the draw gets stuck.
I would not recommend",2.0
"7 yr old is not impressed. First time playing it, one of the pieces slid inside the hole to where it was impossible to even touch it without the buzzer going off. Buzzer going off vibrated the board and moved more pieces out of reach. I'm amazed because I remember loving this game but kiddo refuses to try it again. ""That one's no fun. Let's give it away.""",2.0
"Why has Queen Frostine been demoted to a tarted-up Disney-esque Princess? I'm so sick of this kind of transformation. First Strawberry Shortcake, then Legos, now Candyland. No thanks, I'm not purchasing this version for my kids. It's a bummer, but I'm not supporting this.",2.0
"I ordered this game specifically because it was advertised as being the version with the card deck, which was the kind my little niece and nephew wanted. But, when it arrived it was the newer version.",2.0
It was cheap- the quality the look.  I didn't like it and sent it back right away. It wasn't what I was imagining to complete the grocery store I wanted for them.,2.0
"Mousetrap doesn't offer much in the way of fun, educational value or durabilty. As far as fun goes, it's interesting enough to build the mousetrap on the board, yet it's a slow, tedious game which takes a while to get around the board to finally set the mousetrap off.
As far as educational value's concerned, it doesn't really teach anyone anything. All you're doing is moving a plastic mouse around the board and building an oversized mousetrap. Also it's pretty lousy that as you're building the mousetrap, every bump sets it off or makes a piece of it fall over.
And durability, well, it's not up to much wear and tear and will easily get ruined if there are kids playing it.
So, Mousetrap isn't much of a game and doesn't really offer much in the way of anything and it isn't worth buying.",2.0
"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter after reading the positive reviews.  Sadly, within a few hours of having this cash register, the drawer would not stay closed.  We try to close it, and it latches for a couple of seconds, then springs open on its own.  If we had been more proactive, we would have returned this for another brand.",2.0
"It's still a game based in colors, but not the game I grew up with.  The pieces that used to be red, yellow, green, and blue are now all pastels, and the cards have been replaced with a spinner.  The whole thing looks a little more girly than I'd prefer.",2.0
"This game came incomplete, does not have the cards and some pieces are missing",2.0
"This picture shows the larger, original edition but when I received the package it was the smaller, little girl version. I already had that one so returned it. I do have to say I got to ship it back for free and they were really nice about it. They returned my money within a couple of days. Great service!",2.0
"I'm so disappointed, because my daughter got this for christmas, only used it for a month, and it broke. And I can't return it anymore due to it being too late. But, really a fun toy. Solar powered calculator was awesome while it lasted. The drawer still opens on it, but the calculator part broke so soon. Oh well, win some you lose some. Amazon is always such a good company.",2.0
"I ordered one of these for my son's fourth birthday.  He was extremely excited when he opened it up and got to start playing with it.  Unfortunately, the numbers quit working about 5 minutes later.  I got on Amazon, and within two days another register arrived.  The buttons work fine on the second one, but the solar panel does not.  The only way to get the numbers to light up on the screen is hold the register directly next to a light, or shine a flashlight on the solar panel.  Needless to say, both are being shipped back to Amazon, and I am getting a refund.  I guess the next step is to try another brand.",2.0
Came broken,2.0
"When I purchased this game, I was not aware that it was used. I have purchased used items before, but the seller was always upfront. I would not have been as upset if it were not for the fact that one piece was broken off inside of another piece. The game would have been completely useless if it were not for the creativity and expert troubleshooting of the entire family. We were able to remove the broken piece, used a Dremmel tool to drill into the two pieces, insert a piece of metal from a paper clip and gorilla glue them together. My 7 year old grand daughter would have been devastated if we had not been able to play the game. In the future do not sell games with broken pieces. Another family might not have been fortunate.",2.0
mousetrap pieces fit very loose on the board and if they're not lined up just right the marble won't connect from one piece to another so we're left constantly adjusting the pieces because the marble gets stuck or the man won't make it into the bucket or EXC... pretty frustrating our only alternative is to maybe tape the pieces on to the bottom of the board and leave it built but then what fun is that.,2.0
It's not as pictured. I needed the game board that it pictured. I reviewed the newer compact board with different artwork.,2.0
Its such a pain to put together for such a boring game. The best part is the marble that SOMETIMES rolls into the right place. The trap breaks and doesnt always fall either. Not worth $26. My 5 yr old played with this one time.,2.0
The product was missing the rubber band.  We just found it rwcently,2.0
This sealed package did NOT contain part #9 Stairway.  This is the MAIN route for the marble ball and the game does NOT work without it.  I'm baffled because the package was sealed.  Strange!,2.0
I don't know anyone who as a child wasn't disappointed by this game. The premise seems so cool but the game is rubbish and you never really get to use the trap. Do your kid a favor; get a better game.,2.0
"It doesn't work. There should be a 3rd hand on the pipes.  The Amazon photo ( took a screen shot) shows an extra hand.  This is critical to keep the helping hand moving sideways. If you can get the helping hand to hit the platform thingy it will work.  I have added a photo of what was in the box and a photo of what is on Amazon's website.

Otherwise game pieces seem sturdy and workable.",2.0
"The item pictured was an older version of Candyland, which is what I wanted. The item sent to me was the new version, not happy",2.0
"I always wanted to play this when I was younger but I never could because the older kids ""didn't want to set it up"". Now, as an adult, it does not live up to the childhood hype. There's pointless cheese pieces you collect and it never seemed to end because once you get to the end of the board you rotate between the same six spaces. I can see how as a kid it may be fun- maybe- but this wasn't a fun adult game and I still love to play Life and Monopoly. Monopoly Junior even.",2.0
to many pieces,2.0
"I had fond memories of playing this game growing up, so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas.  After opening the game, however, I'm not so excited.  They have changed the board from the classic version; it is much more visually cluttered and Princess Lollypop and Queen Frostine look like Bratz dolls, which I'm not happy about..  Also, after playing the game as an adult, I realized that it requires no skill whatsoever and is completely a game of chance.  Not super educational.  I'll probably end up donating it to the thrift store.",2.0
"Candy Land is a classic. It's only fun for kids from the ages of about 2 1/2 to 3 1/2. Once they really learn how to play it, they'll quickly realize they are too old for it. That said, it's a great game for teaching toddlers how to follow rules, take turns, recognize colors, and the basics of winning and losing.

The downside is that the new redesign is horribly gaudy. The board is so busy, no wonder kids have ADD these days. It's like a still frame from a video game. Because there is so much clutter on the board, it's hard for even adults to follow the path sometimes and pretty much impossible for a 2-year-old.

Do yourself a favor and get a vintage 70's or 80's era Candy Land on ebay. It's that bad. Trust me. I would have given this game 4 stars if not for the board redesign. Instead it get's 2.",2.0
I much prefer the original. I use this game for therapy and the pictures and colors are much more distinct in the original version. I am sorry I just grabbed the first one I saw.,2.0
"This product is not the one I was looking for! I wanted the Milton Bradley version, the one sent to me was the Hasbro version. It is still a fun game, but I really wanted to replace the exact one my sons played before. If the product was depicted correctly, I would have known to just go to the store.",2.0
"Pay attention to age recommendation, big choking hazard..",2.0

Not the same as the original,2.0
"I played this as a child and loved the game. It was so much fun to look at the pictures because they were so tempting (from the 50's). Sadly the game is cheaply made and the graphics are terrible and extremely ugly. I would pay more for a well made game and would much rather have the vintage graphics than these cheesy looking pictures. Ugly, ugly, ugly!",2.0
Not like the one I had growing up. Meh.,2.0
"The pieces do not stay in place.  Very frustrating for my 5 year old grandson.  He has no interest in playing with it.  He says it's junk and broken.  I would love to get a refund on this product?
Thanks for your ear!",2.0
Not very well made,2.0
We had game pieces missing from the box and it was a brand new game.,2.0
"I have fond memories of playing this game as a child, but I don't know why.  Have you played it recently with your own kids?  You are NEVER going to get to the end.  Even the kids can't hang in there on their never ending journey to Candy Land.  They grow tired of it after reaching the candycanes.  By the time you get to the last stretch of road and your hopes are high, you will inevitably pull a licorice card and be sent back towards the beginning.  It never fails.

The pros of Candy Land are:
A) If  your kid is able to hang in there, he/she would be reviewing their colors and counting
B) Reaching Candy Land is JOYOUS because the misery has finally ended
C) It teaches patience.  Be patient, be patient, be patient, and you may eventually find your little plastic person standing in Candy Land.",2.0
"Many adults don't like playing board games. Why? Because they think that all board games are more-or-less nothing more than sophisticated versions of Candyland - games which rely on nothing more complicated than random chance.

The fact is that random chance doesn't make a very interesting game for adults (unless you're making bets, I suppose), and it doesn't make a very interesting game for children either if they're used to games with more strategy involved. (My young nieces, for example, *will* ask a lot for Candyland - but only because I am not willing to play it with them very often.)

Some people think that the lack of strategy makes these games easy for young children, and that's probably true, but it also makes it frustrating for them - they hit a losing streak and they have *no way* to turn it around, and they know that. I have never seen the same frustration with losing in games like Sleeping Queens or Crazy Eights that I have in Candyland - and, tellingly, when my older niece loses Crazy Eights she pouts and then asks to play again. When she loses Candyland, she pouts and puts the game away!

Some chance is good in a game for kids - it levels the game. But I do not think a game that is entirely based on luck is a good idea.

Instead of Candyland, I'd reccommend a game with some level of skill involved - Memory, or Froggy Boogie, perhaps.

There is no reason you and your kids have to be resigned to games of capricious fate.

Edit: I've found out why my niece likes this game at all. It's not for any aspect of the game itself - it's because when she loses or wins due to chance, we have her ""draw a bedroom"" for herself, or for us. We started doing it because she got too frustrated and upset at losing through no fault of her own.",2.0
I was expecting much more fun game. My daughters are almost 4 and they get bored after 10 minutes :( It's so slow going and boring. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.,2.0

"The new graphics are absolutely hideous. The game now has none of the magic of the version I played with in the '70s.

I wish manufacturers would remember the old saw, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!""",2.0

 daughter wanted to play, we wanted to run the other way...
Boring...., and it is for her now, when after 2 weeks we purchased
much more challanging and interesting games. Also, it isn't made well.  The game board is
not the same size as it was when we were kids, so the playing pieces are too big and overlap the spaces.  The cards are not
laminated.  And, after all the years this game has been around, why are there no children of color on the box/board?  I hope they're not counting the brown lump of molasses.",2.0

So if the manufacturer or the seller says that they are selling the original version, look to see what kind of batteries the game requires.

"Some parts were broken when it was opened, had to order another game so we could get a good game and use the broken one for parts if ever needed!!!",2.0
I thought the quality of this game was pretty low.  All of the pieces keep shifting quite a bit whenever the tweezers come in contact with the metal sides.  It makes it a lot more difficult to remove the parts.  Not what I remembered from the original Operation.,2.0
"I remember playing this game when I was a kid. I perchased it for my daughter thinking that she would have fun. Didn't happen!
She hated the noise it made.(A truely disterbing and loud sound) So we Cut the wire to the sound but it didn't help. She tried to play but the pieces were lost within a week and the game hit the trash.",2.0
"We bought this game for our kids a year or two ago and they rarely ever play it. The pieces regularly get stuck in between the cardboard and are practically impossible to get out.  I had to remove the batteries to get some of the pieces unstuck because there is no on/off switch, and the incredibly annoying buzzer goes off continually while you're trying to dig the pieces out of the cardboard.

I have a lot of happy memories of playing this game as a child, but it was probably made better back then.  My advice to Milton-Bradley - charge an extra dollar or two and put a little quality in your games.",2.0
Just OK. First time I played this with the grandkids they enjoyed building the trap and seeing it all work. But now they just want to get to the part of capturing the mice. And they figured out how to place the mouse under the trap so it won't capture completely. So not sure they are really getting the whole idea of the game. Kids are 7 and 9. Became bored with this pretty quickly.,2.0
"Not made like the old mouse trap games....needs lots of tweaking.
Not a game you can leave a young child to play by himself.
The marble is a potential swallowing hazard as well.",2.0
The pieces are way too small and way too hard to get out of the spaces without making the buzzer go off.  My 6 year old doesn't find anything fun at all about this game.  The pieces get stuck under the game board and are almost impossible to get out. Save your money for something else.,2.0
Bought his for my son for xmas.  We were disappointed that the game has changed since I was little.  Now you build the board as you play the game.  As a result we don't actually play the game.  We set the board up and make up our own game.,2.0
Parts for this toy broke while we were assembling it for the first time.  Very flimsy and impossible for my 4 and 7 year old boys to do without adult supervision.,2.0

"I ordered this due to memories of the game when I was a kid.  There were reviews that I ignored about the quality, so it's my fault.  The game is frustrating for the kids to do since the pieces don't go together well.  This isn't the games we had as a kid.  Don't waste your money.",2.0
"The game is kinda fun and my son loves it, but it's so cheaply built and over priced!  The plastic breaks too easily, nothing sits right and the slightest bump knocks everything out of place.  If your kids aren't asking for it, get them something else!",2.0
"I always enjoyed playing Mousetrap as a kid.  The game setup is the same, but the pieces and mechanisms are very flimsy, cheap, and low quality.  Parts do not fit on the board very well and the mechanism broke after just a couple of times setting it up.  This game is a great example of a company totally sacrificing quality for the bottom line.  A once fun game now compromised.",2.0
"I purchased this game for $4.00 at a thrift store, and all pieces are present in like new condition.  It's certainly not worth any more money than that.  The parts do not all fit together well, but the children enjoy working the contraption.  I do NOT recommend this game.  The plastic parts are flimsy.  I see why someone 'donated' this to the thrift shop.  It's not fully functional!",2.0
"This should be a great game, and is hindered by only one thing:  the mouse trap contraption rarely works as it should.  My daughters and I have set it and re-set it up several times in hopes we will get to see each device work properly, but several do not, especially the board held up by the hand.

I would not spend your money on this, but if you do, good luck getting it to work.",2.0
"Having played the original version of this game and the new one, I can safely say that they have succeeded in making an ok game horrible.  The game was never that great, and always seemed to devolve into simply building the trap and running it over and over.  However, now the trap doesn't even work.

The game now features a small metal ball on top of the pipes instead of a large plastic one.  I assume this is to cut costs since now they only have to manufacture one type of ball (two metal balls instead of a metal one and a plastic one).  The problem is, the metal ball is too small and frequently missing the diving board, falls outside the poorly aligned bathtub, or is too heavy for the hand to lift.

I like the new artwork, but that hardly makes up for its other failures.",2.0
"I don't know if the construction of this has changed since I was little.  The pieces are so cheap and flimsy, one broke while we were removing it (carefully) from the packaging.  We tried tape and glue and it won't stay together well.  My kids still tried to play it but soon got frustrated at how poorly it works.  Looks so fun but isn't.",2.0
"Kids often THINK they want to play something that you are sure will end in tears.  Each time, they think--say--that Monopoly will be a great deal of fun (see my forthcoming review), and even if you know they will end up storming off to their room in tears, you need to go along with it.  Mousetrap is that kind of a game--it LOOKS so much fun, how could it not be?  And if your child has the memory-span of a goldfish, like most do, he'll keep on thinking it is fun, and forget
* the pointless nature of the game itself;
* the way the long thin pieces break and are taped up;
* the way holes in the cardboard surface degrade and the supports begin to fall over;
* in short, the way the game is going to be a disaster.

I was in a position where I could never say ""no"" (the child in question was the young son of my fiance, and, needless to say, I had to prove myself a ""father figure"" kind of guy), and I ended up playing this time and time again, and almost every time there was some sort of meltdown involved.

At the same time, the mousetrap itself IS wonderful.  Yes of course it is Rube Goldberg but Rube himself could ""build a better mousetrap"" and this is it!  The pieces are all charming, the colors random but non-offensive, and the mechanism, when it works those first times, is a delight to behold.  And there is something profound in watching the sequence of events inevitably unfold.  You realize that what you have been building is like an egg on a rooftop--the law of entropy won't be satisfied until things are at a much lower energy state.  Every change involved is in principle irreversible--it is all downhill from here.  Even when you realize that you are the mouse about to be trapped, it is pleasurable to watch it unfold.  (A contrast is Which Witch in which getting bonked is totally unsatisfying.)  And perhaps the child learns something -- not to be so transfixed with the unfolding of irreversible fate that you end up in jail, literal or metaphorical. [23]",2.0
Was difficult to get assembled and once assembled didn't work too well.  Parts were cheap flimsy plastic.  Not how I remembered it when I was a child.,2.0
"...........and even that wouldn't be a bonafide guarentee that the ""Mousetrap"" you built would even work right!

MOUSE TRAP is one of those games that is great in theory. ""Here's a bunch of pieces and gizmos, Kids, and when you put them all together...Voila!/...They build this little bit of machinery called a mousetrap and you will catch the mice in the little basket"". Sounds great and like it might be fun, huh? Only putting the pieces together is not always easy (I curse A LOT playing this game!) and even if you do manage to get all the pieces in place sometimes you have to do a few test runs til you get everything to run like clockwork and actually catch the mice...and then one kid in the group is gonna say""Huh? What? It worked? Do it again. I missed it!""

And if you ever EVER lose even ONE piece..you can kiss this game goodbye. It won't work without it!

I had this game as a kid. My parents would grumble and swear under their breath every time I asked to play with it. They weren't really ""hands on parents"" back then. I like to play games with the kids ....maybe it's cuz my parents didn't like to do it with me that I feel like I have to be a party clown constantly doing things like making sand art, bead jewlery, and being The Banker during MONOPOLY. Fine...I do it and do it smiling. But MOUSE TRAP and EASYBAKE OVEN are my breaking points. They are just too frustrating for words!

(When they film the commercials for MOUSE TRAP, and everyone in the commercial is smiling, having fun, and putting the trap together with great results....I can't help but wonder how many takes it took to film that comercial. Playing MOUSE TRAP is about as much funa s doing your taxes around here!)",2.0
"The new Milton Bradley version of this game I have to say is unfortunately a big disappointment.  We used to LOVE this game as kids.  The new version is not made nearly as well as the one 30 years ago.  We think it is VERY boring.  Although the kids do think it's quite fun, if we parents can make it through it without pulling out our hair.  I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this.",2.0
I bought the game and opened it up and found out that a piece was missing..one of the cranks.  I only had one.  How are you going to play this game with only one crank when you need two.,2.0
"This game is a pain!!!  You have to build a piece of the contraption with each play.  It takes forever, it falls apart easily, and it's just not fun.  My 6 year old thinks it's fun at the end when you actually get to make the contraption work, but most kids (and parents) would not have the patience to sit through the game to build it!",2.0
"This game is defective, compared to the Mouse Trap I played with 20+ yrs ago.

The arm used to push the thing-a-ma jig no longer uses a spring, thus making it useless. 90% of the time the trap doesn't work. VERY frustrating for the kids. Also, the game uses metal balls now, which are too heavy for the hand-arm to push into the bathtub.

I don't recommend purchase, unless you have a ton of patience. Your kids will have more fun with other games.",2.0
We got this game for our girls last Christmas thinking it would be fun. This is NOTHING like the one from when we were kids. It's not real sturdy and it's way too complicated for younger kids. It's a pain in the patuti to put together and when you get it put together it may work a couple of times before it gets scooted apart and have to be re-adjusted. The kids don't even pay attention to the game part they just like to play with the pieces. My youngest likes to turn the crank and launch the man into the bathtub but it requires a lot of work just to get that to happen. The kids can't play with it unless one of us is right there with them. It stays in the closet on the shelf most of the time.,2.0
"I give this game two stars because my 5 year old son always pulls it out to want to play with it. The game itself is not worth playing, but the construction part can be fun.
However, the game pieces are so poorly and cheaply made that I don't think it is worth anyone's time to play with it. Not only do the parts NOT fit, but the thin plastic pieces bend and break very easily. My husband got this game because he played with it as a kid, but this particular set does NOT offer the same kind of fun as the old set.",2.0
This game seems like it would be fun but it is hard to get the hang of. All of the pieces are hard to figure out where they go and the directions are kind of hard to understand. I guess with some time and some patients this is a fun and durable game.,2.0
We have family game night every Friday.  My 7 year old has been begging for this game.  When he got it he was so excited.  We played it as a family and was boing and most of the time it never worked properly.  The one good thing about this game is that my son plays with it by putting it together and watching the marble roll and fall down.  Do yourself a favor and by the traditional board games.  This one is a no go.,2.0
I bought this game for Christmas and wish I hadn't.  It took me quite a while to set this 'game' up and I don't think my boys even made it thru one game - they became impatient or frustrated that it wasn't staying together (or that our kitties were knocking the parts around).  I thought this game came set up and didn't expect such assembly.  I would NOT purchase this game again - get your kids something ELSE!!,2.0
"That should be what it is called! It looks like a really cute,fun game but...at least the versions here in Australia--are so hard to use because the Mouse Trap keeps falling apart. It needs to be made better.",2.0

Complicated and not interesting parlor/family game.  Looked better than it was.  Gave the product away after a couple of weeks.,2.0
This game is fun for about two plays but get old quickly.  The sayings and proverbs are very obscure and family and friends enjoy making up crap for only so long.  For the $40 price tag pass and get two other more entertaining games!,2.0
"Impressed by other reviews I bought this game for several members of my family.  We played it in a group of six on Christmas day and were extremely disappointed.  The proverbs, assuming they are real, are not only obscure, but often rather meaningless.  For example, one was (roughly) ""Every hill....has a slope.""  By the time you have gone around a few times you know that no one is likely to know or guess the right answer. Because of this, the part of the game where others guess whether someone else has the right answer doesn't work--you know they are going to be wrong.  This was a great idea but very badly executed.",2.0
Eh. Not that much fun.,2.0
Multiple parts broke and snapped off after minimal use/play.,2.0
Very small. Flimsy and cheap feeling. Wish I would have bought the larger ones that you see in the science museums.,2.0
It is fun but it does not glow very well at all. We were disappointed in that.,2.0
Cheap plastic. Broke an hour after opening.,2.0
"Got this based on the reviews and how much we enjoyed Sleeping Queens (for a game the whole family can play).  We didn't enjoy this one nearly as much.  It isn't a bad game, but when placed next to other games in our game closet this one wouldn't get chosen.",2.0

Did not glow. I feel mislead because it's very small. I know it says mini but the pic on the box looks bigger than it actually is. Also the picture shows the whole thing glowing which it doesn't!

"I am a teacher and ordered this product for my classroom.  While I wouldn't expect this product to stand up to heavy abuse, it broke almost immediately.  One of the blue connector plastic pieces fell off after one of my students simply handled the sphere.  I spent ten minutes trying to get the two blue pieces 'clicked' back together, but they will not stay on the sphere.  Now I am simply waiting for the rest of it to fall apart.  Good idea in theory, but not if it cannot be used without breaking.",2.0
I was not pleased with this purchase. I was thinking it was going to be better quality than it actually was. As soon as it was played with little pieces kept breaking off and eventually the whole ball broke. Not worth buying....,2.0

"My 4 year old son loves the large version of this toy. He always plays with the one that belongs to his uncle, so I thought he would enjoy his own mini version. Plus this one is cheaper than the really big one. This mini sphere keeps getting stuck open, and there is not as many fun things to do with it. He tried playing with it when he first got it, but as it keeps getting stuck, and is so small, he has lost all interest.

"I bought 2 of these for my 2 kids for christmas (20 months and 3 1/2)  my husband and i were really excited cause they were the big santa gift.  We bought them plastic license plates with their names on them.  We waited ti; 2 nights before christmas to put these together because we didn't have a place to hide 2 of these.  Good thing we didn't wait til christmas eve like we were planning (i was paranoid they might be missing a piece)  Well, they weren't missing any pieces.  the first one took my husband and i, (together) over an hour to put together.  The instructions are the worst thing i'd ever seen.  There are NO words and you can't even understand the pictures; They skip steps and expect you to know what to do.  After we finally got through the first we were ready to tackle the second.  Well, it was faster.  15 minutes in we were on like the second to last step, and two of the pieces would not fit together.  We tried everything. Frustrated, I woke up at 6am christmas eve morn to go to walmart to exchange.  Guess what, i had the exact same problem.  Returned again, and they were out.  Went to toysrus and the SAME THING.  Okay now i'm peeved.  (my husband had been from square one)  then finally got another and it worked.  My daughter is actually almost too big for it (ages go up to 5) shes 3 1/2 and small for her age.  hers doesn't get any use and my son will sit in it and turn the wheel, but not move his feet because they get stuck under his seat.  i bought them  the matching gas pump and my son loves to put gas in his and his sisters car, but still they never actually get 'driven.'",2.0
Couldn't get my 8 year old at the time to be interested for more than the first 5 minutes after it arrived.  She is an awesome student and loves learning but even I got bored with this machine.  It is not for kids that are quick to learn; the repeat of these learned skills without change in how it is displayed is too redundant.  I had to force her to play it as review homework.  Not an ideal tool for learning for her learning style.,2.0

The only frustrating thing is that the steering wheel keeps coming off!  Believe me, it wasn't easy to figure out how to put it on in the first place!  It comes off almost every time he plays with it, and when that happens we have to wait for daddy to come home and fix it, because mommy is clueless.  Just thought you potential buyers should know.",2.0
Did not hold attention long. Tossed aside.,2.0
"We purchased the Cozy Coupe for our daughter for Christmas.  We discovered that the moldings and holes didn't align at all.  We ended up using a utility knife to cut the holes and make them bigger.  It still didn't fit because our daughter still can't close/open the door.  We went as far as to call the company and they told us that it is a tight fit and we should try to lube the parts.  This will not help since the door doesn't fit and my husband and I have a hard time opening and closing the door.  My recommendation would be to find a toy that is comparable and steer clear of the Little Tikes.  (We had a similar problem with the Little Tikes Gourmet Kitchen set, also a Christmas gift)",2.0
"In theory, this is an excellent learning tool.  However there are a number of flaws that I haven't really seen mentioned.
1. The screen is AWFUL.  Very poor contrast, no backlighting, difficult to see even in bright light.
2. Too much set up when you turn it on.  Select volume on or off, select problem type (have to choose one of ADD, SUBTRACT, DIV, MULT and the buttons are WORDS instead of symbols, much less intuitive for kids.  There is no mode to mix problems of different types)
3. Select difficulty level.  It should remember settings (or let you set it up for different children) and just get going without having to go through all this.  I have an INFINITELY superior (in every respect) math (and spelling/reading) learning game on my iPhone, it's 10x what this game is and costs $1.99.  We just wanted to get him something that would be 'his' instead of having to give up my phone for him to play (and invariably find him playing Angry Birds instead :)).
4. The volume is very quiet and not adjustable
5. The indicator you got it right/wrong is just a red or green LED with a simple noise.

This reminds me a great deal of the old math computers they had in school back circa 1979.  The game 'does the job', but it doesn't make the experience FUN beyond the math itself and the user experience is horrible.",2.0
"The screen is hard to see brand new.  A year later and it is unreadable.  My daughter learned with it and still tries to use it, but it's no use.",2.0
"It is a great concept -- but the LCD is just too hard to read, even when the contrast is set to high.",2.0
Not sure why more reviewers didn't mention the fact that the numbers are very difficult to see on the screen.  Regardless of the fact that you can adjust the contrast it was still frustrating and requires you to strain your eyes to see the math problems.  We love all of the functions but are going to return this product and have already purchased the Math Whiz.  It doesn't do all of the functions that the Shark does but it's a good start and you can actually see the math problems on the screen very well!,2.0
Not impressed.  The graphics are very hard to read and all it is is numbers!  In this world of amazing graphics this should not be an issue.  My kids love math but this only holds my 7 year old attention for a few minutes.  I would not recommend.,2.0

"Ok so these guys aren't worth your money. I received the package yesterday and was excited that they has gotten here only to open them up and see one the balls had extremely loose stitching. ALSO! VERY IMPORTANT the juggling balls I received did not all have the same weight. This is very important. One was extremely light, one had a good weight (except it was the one with the stitching slowly undoing itself) and the other was slightly heavier then the lightest one. All in all these MIGHT be good for a gag gift or maybe a friend you don't really like. However these are not really for extended use. Thanks for reading.",2.0
"If you're learning to juggle and aren't very coordinated, then avoid these juggling bags.  (The advert says they balls, but they're not.  They more like a bean bag.)

Because they're too light and not round, it's not easy to throw or catch them consistently.  Shop around for heavier, rounder juggling bags.  They may cost a little more.  You might not find them at Amazon.  They sell them at web sites, where professionals buy juggling supplies, such as seriousjuggling.com.

Higher quality juggling bags are worth it, if you really want to learn to juggle.  Many people try to learn, but few succeed.  One reason is because the bought cheap juggling bags.

YouTube has some great short videos showing (not just explaining) how to learn to juggle.  Try a few out to see which person teaches in a way you can understand and practice.",2.0
"These were purchased for my son and I to juggle with - Very inexpensive but I guess I now know why.  After three days they start splitting up and the filling starts to come out.

"These balls are light and not durable at all. After some light use, the stitching started to come loose, and the inner flakes of stuff started to leak out.",2.0
"I don't think I'd recommend these for a beginner or anyone, really. They are very light and not a very good quality. They are very difficult to get used to; at least I find. I'm an intermediate juggler and would not recommend these balls. One of the balls has a tag that you need to cut off. They don't feel good in the hands and are not very easy to catch.",2.0
The balls are in fine condition and I can juggle them easily but they smell disgusting!! I don't know what happened or if it is something inside them but those juggling balls smell gross and so do my hands after I use them.,2.0
I received multiple ball sizes and weights which is very inconvenient for beginner jugglers to use while learning. Two different types of balls were included with stickers added giving both types the same barcode!! Even the balls in the same packages that matched in size had different weights which makes them less desirable as a juggling set especially for beginners. Overall I was unimpressed and feel that this company failed to deliver what it had promised to deliver with it's description online.,2.0
"Not as tight and durable as I would have liked.  Cheaply made and does not provide a firm, solid grip.  If you have never juggled before these will work for learning, but otherwise I would stay away.",2.0
"The problem with this product is that the 3 balls were not the same size and weight.  One ball was big and heavy (relatively speaking), one was small and light, and one was in between.  Having balls of different weights makes it harder to throw the balls accurately.  As a result, your balls will go to different heights and your juggling will look amateurish.  It will probably also take you longer to learn new tricks because you can't throw accurately.  In addition, it's just annoying to have that lopsided feel as you juggle.  All the manufacturer would have had to do was just make sure to put the same number of plastic beads in each ball.  How hard could that be?

I would recommend that you spend a little more and get better quality balls.  Or alternately spend less -- forget bean bag balls and buy some cheap rubber balls.  They will be the same size and weight as each other, and they will feel better as you juggle.  If you drop them as you juggle, you will have to chase them.  But you can fix that by juggling over your bed; when they drop they will stay put.",2.0

It shows these as being used to connect gears from the center axis, one year at an angle to the other. In reality it's quite difficult to get it to fit (adult not kid does it).  Once connected it doesn't stay attached for long.  It's also frustrating how easily the whole machine loses a part as soon as the child turns the crank.  For this kind of money I would've expected better.

It is a nice idea.  My 3.5 year old loves to build things with it and see the wheels turn.  It's a good simple introduction to gears for a child too young for products like lego.",2.0
"This is a cheap copy. I think is a chinese version, it is not the original. The package arrived broken, fhe cards look smaller and cheap, misaligned borders, dumb colors. It is just a generic copy of the original game",2.0
"I purchased this add-on set specifically for the springs, propeller and colorful decals.  I was disappointed that the instruction booklet is written on adult level and instruction are vague. Pictures are helpful but not in color or in a format that is kid friendly. Each type of connector is a different color. The set really lends it for color coding.  I was expecting something more like Lego and Duplo instructions. Additionally, it is very difficult to pull connectors and extension pieces apart to reconfigure. Worst of all, one of the 2 springs broke the first time I tried to pull it apart.  I actually purchased 2 different sets because I love building sets of all kinds and was very excited to work with my grandchildren to construct moving gears. The 60 piece starter set was more what I expected. Pieces connect and disconnect easily. Instructions are more detailed but still not in color. Neither set shows specific design ideas to spur creativity.",2.0
It did not have any extra cards advertizing other games and so I could not use them to play some of the other games I like to play and use the extra cards as wild cards.  I was disappointed because the extra cards were not in this particular deck.,2.0
"Do not recommend to anyone that has played Rook in their youth with good Rook cards.  These cards are crappy, small and are not standard playing card size (these are smaller).  Also, the tray that is advertised to come with the cards is the cardboard insert in the box.  I'm on a hunt for actual, REAL, Rook cards.  I plan to pass these along during the holiday season as a gift at a ""White Elephant"" party.",2.0
"Both decks I received only had red and yellow cards, no green or blue!",2.0
"I love rook.  If you like partnership games and trick-taking games it is a must.  The game has stood the test of time and certainly has held my attention.  I got tired of just playing with a standard deck of cards, which you can do but having a specialized deck is nice.  However, this deck is not the one.  The box is very poor quality, the instructions are convoluted (so don't buy for new players) and the backs of the cards are almost entirely white with tiny red spots that look sort of like rooks if you squint at them.  They look nothing like the nice, pretty artwork advertised here.

My advice, get a different version of rook, or save your money and learn to play with a standard deck of cards.  Stay away from this piece of junk.",2.0
"I would definitely not call this a water symphony....they barely make a sound when you tap them in the water. They are cute, but pointless. My 1 year old son showed no interest in them.",2.0
We bought the cards less then 3 months ago and they are falling apart. They are very flimsy not sturdy at all.,2.0
I did not receive my first set of Deluxe Rook. The set I finally received was not as pictured. It was a cheap set worth half what I paid. Had a cardboard tray instead if plastic which fell apart when I took it out of book.,2.0
Very poorly made. The color is not natural,2.0
"It takes up a lot of space, without being much fun.
The rings break apart too easily, which frustrates the little kid. Plus, they don't whistle easily...also frustrating a little kid.",2.0
Sounded like a lot of fun in the toy's description. Very difficult to get the toy to make a sound and when it does not much. Don't waste your money!!,2.0
I can't believe I didn't read reviews on this product before purchasing! My son enjoys making music on his piano and drums and I was looking forward to getting these dolphins for months.  The dolphins are hard to connect together and do not stay connected.  I cannot get anything but a lame chirp out of the dolphins either.  They are relatively cute bath toys (the color of the flotation rings and dolphins don't match like they do in all the photos) but don't serve the purpose for which they were intended.,2.0
"I have heard great things about this toy for a few years now. I bought it for my daughter when she was old enough to play with it, but I don't know if I'm old enough to play with it! You need a lot of patience with these dolphins. Their whistle spouts get filled with water every time you turn around, and then they won't whistle. They also tend to topple over in their little life preserver rings (which don't match the color of the dolphins by the way). The life preservers hook together, eventually, and just when you get them hooked together, they pop off as soon as you start messing around with them. Like I said, you need a lot of patience. They take up a lot of space too, both in the tub and in the tub toy holder. I have found that it's best to just play with one or two dolphins at a time and put the others away. And a low pitch one too so you can actually hear the notes. It also seems to work best to just blow through the dolphins like a whistle, you get a much better sound that way, however, I am not real comfortable with that  seeing as you have to blow through the dolphin's rear.
So, overall, I would say that if you have a giant tub, a lot of patience, skills with making a dolphin whistle, and very good hearing, then I would recommend this toy, otherwise, stick to the rubber duckies.",2.0
"This was a gift to my 18 month old daughter from a family member. These other reviews are correct. The toy is not loud - imagine a weak squeaker. The dolphin rings don't stay connected (my 4yo was extremely frustrated), the only ""music"" they play is when one uses the back of the box to find the corresponding notes with each dolphin and play the notes one by one. My daughter likes to put the dolphin rings on her finger...that's the only thing we get from this toy.",2.0
"This was a fun toy to look at and the box it came in was huge compared to what was inside. The colors are fantastic, but actually getting the gears to work is another story all together. The snaps were EASILY breakable and would lodge inside the gears.  The directions for making a robot or an airplane were ridiculous and I usually don't have a problem with complicated directions.  Skip this one and go for a science kit.",2.0
Bought this for my 9 year old son.  We followed the directions and got a mess.  Not at all what is in the description.  He was very disappointed as was I.,2.0
"I have been playing with the deluxe version for several years, recently bought 10 decks and im on the seventh one and after about three are four games cards begin to come apart on all the corners, and im playing on a felt top card table. This is the first ones ive had to do that, think i have a bad bunch.",2.0
"My daughter got this for her second birthday.  I had been eyeing it for awhile, and was happy to receive this gift because she is very interested in music.  This toy is supposed to play a musical scale, there are 8 dolphins and each one based on the color is supposed to sing one of eight notes.  When we hooked the thing together, the rings completely unhooked from one another and when you tap the dolphins on the head (when they are in water) they only sing one of two tones.  I envisioned playing the dolphins like they were a xylophone, maybe playing a song with them, but there is no way, there are only two notes and 4 of the dolphins play one, and 4 play the other.  The way they represent themselves really is ludicrous (""Play a symphony in your bathtub."" Yeah, right!).

That said, my daughter does put one or two in her bath, spills water in their bellies, flips them over and pours the water out.  There is no difference between these and much cheaper bath toys.",2.0
"didn't stay linked in a ring, difficult to keep the appropriate amt of water in them to make them whistle.  We tossed them.",2.0
"I bought this toy because I thought it was cute, As the other reviewers have said the dolphins & their corresponding tubes do not match, not even close. They whistle when you push them down in the water, but you have to do it quickly to even make a peep and the sound isn't even that loud.  My son likes to connect the chains and put the dolphins in each tube.  My son (2 years old) also likes to stack all the tubes on his arm like bracelets, it amuses him, and he doesn't necessarily care about the matching colors which is why I've given it two stars.  Essentially your child will play with this toy in their own way, not necessarily as advertised or intended by the maker.",2.0
"My boys received this as a gift, and at first I thought this was great.  A non-splashing, fun, colorful and interactive bath toy. But it's not what it should be.  Water gets inside the dolphins and when this happens, they won't make noises.  How do you keep water out of a tub toy?  Even when you do get one to play a sound, you can barely hear it.  And believe it or not, they include a sheet of music to let you tap to the tune of children's songs.  I'd love to see that demonstrated.  It's also a bad design - the rings that the dolphins sit in do NOT stay linked together. Slight movements that disturb the water will cause the chain to come apart and that makes my 3-1/2 year old upset.

Another annoyance is the lack of matching colors. The dolphins and the rings are not the same color.  Over all, a cute and colorful toy, but also a complete waste of money. Unless you like to see them just float around, you will be disappointed.",2.0
"This toy is supposed to be for babies and toddlers and yet it doesn't have any of the features one would expect in a young child's toy.

One would expect color, ease of use, softness, and purpose.  The only qualification that the Water Symphony Tub matches is that the dolphins and the rings are colorful.

Which brings me to the question of  who on earth thought that making the rings so hard to connect was a good idea.  As a mom, I usually have other chores at bath time other than ring rangler.  And then there is the hardness factor.  The dashboard of my car is softer.  A little more built-in teething satisfaction would have been nice.

Two stars.  The dolphins do make noise but not often enough.  They are hard enough that a baby can hurt their gums on them, or *you* or a sibling if they are thrown.  One plus is that they don't seem to mildew.",2.0
"The description sounds great but the actual toy doesn't deliver. The rings don't stay together unless the water is still. When the dolphins tip over, which is nearly all the time, they fill with water and the sound mechanism becomes clogged. They have to dry out before working properly again. We still play with them all the time (children ages 1 and 3) but only because they are colorful and float-y.",2.0
We got these for our daughter becasue she loves bath time and playing her toy piano.  We figured this would be a cute toy that she would enjoy but we were wrong.  You have to beat the poor dolphins to get them to play a note.  And the note is more of an electronic sound...it's hard to describe it but it's NOT a musical note!  And it never fails after fianlly beating the things enough to get a sound out of them the ring comes loose.  It's just a total pain to use.  Granted she still plays with them in the tub just we could have bought a cheap bag of plastic dolphins at the aquarium and saves 3/4 of the money we spent on this set.,2.0
"I was excited about the idea of a little toy for my 19-month old that made music in the tub.  From the description of the toy, you'd think that's what this was.  First of all, tapping the dolphins on the head makes either a ridiculous whistling noise that can barely be called a note, if it works at all.  Most of the time, they don't really work at all.  And, as stated in other reviews, the ring does NOT stay together in the tub, making it hard to keep track of them and play any kind of ""song"" whatsoever.  That being said, it's a cute toy if you're just looking for a brightly colored, floating tub toy, and for that purpose, my daughter likes it.  Just don't expect it to be much else.",2.0
Very fragile.  Even with gentle play they are falling apart and my son was just given this about a week ago.  It sucks that he loves them because it breaks his heart every time another one rips.,2.0
"I was excited when my daughter received this for her first birthday. But it just doesn't work the way it should. The ring, when strung together, takes up a lot of room in the tub. The dolphins don't stay connected at all. Only a few of the dolphins actually whistle the right pitch when you tap them. Some of them you have to tap very hard to get any sound...and my daughter's still a baby. She's not going to understand how to make it work. At this point the dolphins and innertubes are just stuffed in the toybox, and we've gone back to rubber ducks and the like. I didn't hate this toy, but I wouldn't recommend it, either.",2.0
"As countless others said, they don't play music well and they surely don't stay together at all. To get mine to whistle, I have to bang really hard on them.

That said, my toddler has no idea they are supposed to make music, so she thinks they are fun.

Over all, not worth the money.",2.0
"The original Rush Hour is still much more fun.  The only reason I had to buy this is my son is such a train freak.  The puzzles are not as challenging overall, yet the difficulty level is a bit uneven in the four categories (junior, beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Also, the build quality is poorer, as a few of the train pieces don't sit properly on the board, and the colors on the train pieces do not match those printed on the puzzle cards, a sore point for a young boy.",2.0
"I have a 4 year and it became very frusterating for her to use the register because it turns off automatically after 30 seconds. This does not give a child enough time to figure out what she wants to do or the items to use next. Even when she is in the middle of a sale if she takes too long to press the next button the machine will shut off and she has to start the sale over. I find the only thing she does use on this cash register is the microphone, everything else is too old for her age group.",2.0
"I bought this for my daughters (ages 18 mos & 7 mos at the time) for Christmas thinking they'd really enjoy a musical tub toy. Well, they're hardly ""musical"". If you tap on their heads, and the water has to be deep enough, they'll sort of play a note. Each fish has it's own note. They don't work at all in a bubble bath and my daughters never play with them to make music. They like filling them up with water and dumping the water out more than anything else. A couple of cups would have provided the same entertainment. I wouldn't spend the money again.",2.0
"This is such a cute toy we were really hoping it would be a lot of fun but it was not to be.
Things that we found to be wrong:
1. Instructions are nill to none.
2.  Some dolphins you have to press really hard to get a noise others you have to tap very very very very lightly or they make no noise at all.
3.  The color coding is weird.
4.  The ""rafts"" that keep the dolphins floating are worthless.  They are just too hard to get to link and then they come apart way to easily.
I gave it two stars instead of one as my son does like to play with the dolphins.
The product does NOT work as it says it is intended to.",2.0
"I swear by the reviews on Amazon.com, but unfortunately I did not read them before purchasing.  Our 4th son just turned 1, and celebrated his 2nd Christmas.  I just bathed him and put the dolphins in with him....believe what you read.  The rings do not stay together and the dolphins really don't sing!!  If you tap the tops of the head, nothing happens; if you lift the dolphin out of the water and slightly ""smack"" the water with it, it will make a noise.  Quite frankly it works better if you blow into the dolphin.  The baby got a kick out of the toy for a short time.  Maybe I'll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around.  Also, this toy takes up lots of room!!  I gave it 4 stars for durability since it does seem pretty sturdy.",2.0
"Having said that, it was hard to learn and is generally aggrivating to play, but I'm sure it would be fun for people who like poker or Uno games.",2.0
I bought this toy For my son when he turned one and he did not understand it so I put it away until now which he is 18 months old.  This toy is not fun because the circle parts that are supposed to say together and float do not stay together and they fall apart.  My son gets frustrated with it and just starts to plunge the dolphines in the water to hear the toot sounds and then throws it out of the tub.  The only education i found is that it helped with his motor skills because he practiced puting them together but again he would end up throwing them out of the bath tub.  This toy is not worth the money that you paid for it.,2.0
Very small and hard to handle the pieces,2.0
I bought this two years ago for my son's 2nd birthday.  He's a real bath lover. What a disappointment!  The rings don't stay locked together most of the time and once in a blue moon you will get a faint tone out of one of them when bobbed just right in the water.  My kids prefer the water fingerpaints and boats to this thing.  I paid for this toy at an upscale toy store back then.  What a big waste.,2.0
"Disappointed. We bought it one year ago and it was rarely used and in the closet. Now, my son took it out of the closet to use and it had one very. very small damage (I don't even want to call it damage). The result is upsetting: The good and nice sound is gone. Very sad and very disappointing.",2.0
I should have read the reviews. Would have saved me from buying this! Marbles are plastic not glass like the description says. The packaging even says glass marbles. Lie!!,2.0
I did not think it was well made at all.  The indents weren't deep enough to keep the marbles in place while playing with my grandchildren.  I had also tried other places for Chinese Checkers and found them all to be far inferior to what I had as a child.  Very disappointing since I still enjoy the game itself.,2.0
It was too small. Couldnt grasp the marbles correctly and other marbles on board would roll out of place. Good for a kid.,2.0
"The Item was not as described, had cheap plastic marbles instead of glass marbles.  Glass marbles were indicated in the product description.",2.0
"My fault, but I thought the game would be much bigger.  More like a standard chess board size.  It's is about 2/3rds of that and the marbles and very cheap and plastic which makes them hard to play with especially on such a small board.",2.0
"The product is NOT as described: marbles are PLASTIC and small - about pea size!

The description says GLASS marbles!

Also Instruction Sheet not enclosed.

Not holes in the tin, but shallow indentions and the marbles are easily dislodged!

Three of the colors for the marbles do not match the board: black, white, and green! Only red, blue, and yellow match!  Thus lacking the violet, purple and orange/pumpkin colors!

Very cheaply made as regards the pea-size PLASTIC marbles and the indentions being shallow!

No way, no how comes close to the Chinese Checkers that I had invisioned and used in my youth!",2.0
"These cards are poor quality.  Im holding them next to an old UNO deck, and they are thin, have minimal coating and are poorly constructed.",2.0
"This is a cheap knock-off of the previous set of Uno cards that I own that should match this.  There are tons of spelling mistakes on the packaging AND in the instructions.  The colors or off and have a lot of print issues.  They also don't feel like they've been coated properly like the deck I was trying to replace.  If all you want to do is toss these to your kids because they will most likely destroy them, then this is all you need.",2.0
Not meant to be played with. My 2 yr old destroyed this thing in days. Looks the part though.,2.0
"While the description of the game - which is awesome - is accurate, the product that I received is definitely not the original Uno game which is what the description is about.

Reading other reviews, it seems like a different picture was associated with the product, but it was changed back. The seller wrote in the product description ""(Notice: It's normal if there is a litter off color, and it won't affect the normal game.)"" and this is NOT accurate, the product other than matching the numbers/symbols in the cards is NOT the correct/original game.",2.0
I was disappointd in the quality and manufacture of this product sent from China. It didn't live up to its product description either.,2.0
"The first Remo kids drum we purchased was the 10"" floor tom. Absolutely great drum, 100% buy recommendation.

At the time I ordered this drum, the photo on the Amazon page was incorrect - it showed a 22 x 8 drum, however, the description is for a 22 x 21 drum and that is what you are buying. I contacted the seller and I presume the correct photo will be posted shortly.

I really wanted to like this drum. Unfortunately, drums are fussy things. I have banged on many drums for many hours (yes, my grand fantasy is that I am a drummer in a rock band). No hope there, however, I do know what a drum should sound like. Essentially, a clear boom is the desired effect.

Unfortunately, this drum lacks the clarity required of anything but a toy for a room full of kids to mindlessly bang on. When struck, a drum produces a fundamental harmonic. If the overtones agree with the fundamental, a pleasing sound is produced. If the harmonic overtones are random, then a harsh, rattling, jarring sound is produced.

I think Remo has gotten ahead of their technical abilities on this product. Terrific idea, a gathering drum for kids. Sorry, execution is severely lacking.

Not that you should not buy this product, a room full of kids banging on a drum is a wonderful thing. However, my recommendation is that you buy a for real bass drum (used, and for less money). These are listed on ""bayeee"". I purchased a Pdp 22 x 16 for less than one Benjamin. Totally rocks out! Maybe a pawn shop, if one is convenient.",2.0
My grandkid lost interest after a few blasts.,2.0
"This kit is not as hard to assemble as some people on here have claimed, but it does require some effort and concentration. I definitely wouldn't expect a child to be able to assemble this on their own unless they are extremely resourceful and allowed to use tools with sharp edges. So if it's a gift for a child that is not your own, just be aware of this!

The most frustrating aspect of this rocket kit is actually the chemical delivery and containment system employed to power the rocket. It takes some trial and error to get a feel for how much vinegar and baking soda is needed, and how ""tight"" the stopper should be prior to the initiation of the chemical reaction. I went through a quarter of a box of baking soda and a quart of vinegar before I was able to get a successful launch with my children. Don't listen to the instruction booklet, which recommends a cup of vinegar and three quarters of the ""delivery tube"" filled with baking soda for ""high performance."" Instead use about three fifths of a cup of vinegar and two fifths to half of the tube filled with baking soda. This quantity of reactants will give you ample time to mix the reactants, set the rocket down, and move away before it blasts out of your hand!

Overall, fun when we finally got the thing to work, but a pain in the arse prior to then. I award the product two stars because there are other products on the market that take the tediousness of assembly out of the equation and simplify the process of mixing the reactants. These other systems, however, will cost you more.",2.0
"Probably should have looked into something a little more kid friendly and age appropriate!
My 5 year old had a hard time putting this together and I ended up doing all of it for him.",2.0
"This kit was much more difficult to build than other kits we used and did not fly as well.  I am glad I only purchased one for my STEM in Space Club and gave 2 8th graders over an hour to build it.  After launching it, they did not want to keep it.",2.0
"This product consisted of a plastic bottle, some ply-wood, some cellophane, and some silvery paper. The cellophane and paper were for ""decorating"" the bottle, but were very difficult to apply - and the directions didn't help at all. Couldn't complete the job at one sitting because had to buy an x-acto knife first. So we ended up with an ugly looking plastic bottle. Making it blast off was easy, just as we could have done with a plane plastic bottle. Very disappointing.",2.0
"The rocket went together great until the end... Couldn't get the nose to fit.  Tried our best, but when we launched it, it went up about 10 feet with it leaking everywhere.  Would have been great if we could have put it together.  I'm an engineer by degree... You would have thought putting it together would have been a no brainer...",2.0
"This toy is a disappointment, the kit is overpriced for what it contains & the function of the rocket is terrible. Building the kit went fine & is enjoyable (which is half the reason to buy kits such as these) & the theory of operation is sound. The problem we had with the rocket is the stopper pops out just as soon as you set it down thus there is no time for pressure to build and the thing just goes about 10 feet into the air. If I try to tighten the stopper it slips out of the bottle opening again & again. I'm going to try to roughen up the bottle opening & the rubber stopper (or try a different stopper) to see if we can get it to stay in place - if this works the rocket should fly much better.",2.0
"Carving the balsa wood pieces under template, plus cutting, sizing, and attaching various pieces together lends a real feeling of anticipation.  Unfortunately, unless you get it JUST right (and even when you do), it is rather anti-climactic.  If you're one who loves the tinkering and assembly and isn't overly concerned about results, this is for you.  About an hour of ""fun"" with that, then several misfires and a lucky shot or two (and a bottle or two of vinegar), and its about time to hang it up.  Unless, of course you have lots of patience and determination.

HELPFUL HINT:  If you buy this, check out the ""instructions supplement"" regarding the fin attachment that is included but not shown in the parts list.  Makes for much sturdier fins that will stay on and takes lots of time off the original assembly.

I would rate this toy ""fair"", but at almost $20, its too much.",2.0
"This is a good product, but highly over-priced.  $10 for FOUR pieces of track ???????",2.0
"When I saw this I immediately thought of my grandson and how much he would enjoy it, but after opening it and having him play with it I was disappointed. The gears do not always move as they should and it seems expensive for what it can actually do. It said it was educational but as a former teacher I do not see how that is. I would not recommend this to anyone.",2.0
"The concept of this toy is fantastic, but when we opened it one of the magnets was missing from one of the gears and it does not work without the magnet.  It was a gift and by the time it was opened I could not return it :(  I'd be happy if I could just get a replacement magnet.",2.0
"I don't understand all the great reviews.  It's definitely great out of the box  after five minutes, you find yourself looking at it saying ""ok- i see it and I get it- what's next""?  You can shift around the pieces a few times, but then you are done.  I have no clue how this can keep any kids attention for more than 5 minutes here and there.",2.0
"There are lots of positivie reviews about this toy, which you can refer to hear all the good things this toy has to offer. Here are the I don't like about it:

1. It's makes noise that is appealing to children but very annoying to the adults in our family.
2. There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it, so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily.

UPDATE: This toy lasted two and a half months before the motor that turns the gears broke and the toy stopped working for good.",2.0
"I was a rock musician during the fun days, so I know what a decent drum is supposed to sound like.  Kids won't know the difference, but this drum has an annoying metallic sounding resonance, somewhat like hitting a large tin can.  I purchased this based on the raving reviews, and it is completely puzzling how so many people would miss mentioning the resonance (are all the reviews real?).  I know this is a kid product and not for professionals, but the product description talks about the ""enhanced low-pitched fundamentals.""

The drum sticks are nice though.

I will try the larger diameter Remo Kids gathering drum to see if perhaps those don't have the ringing overtones.",2.0
We got this puzzle as a gift for my son. The knob size is good but the shapes are much too complex for a 12 month old to line up. My son understands what to do with the pieces but all the little edges and corners make it much too difficult for him to fit it where he goes. He ends up mad at the toy. The pieces are very thin as well. I would recommend this but only for a child around 24 months old,2.0
not what I expected bean bags were not full and were much lighter than expected,2.0

too cheaply made. 2 of them came unraveled the first time we played with them and there were little white pellets everywhere.,2.0

It is indestractable, believe me he has thrown it, sat on it and stepped on it.  Problem is, he could care less.  We tried playing with him, naming the colors and shapes.  One shot through the line-up and he was off looking for something else to do.  In my opinion, it's just not interesting enough.",2.0
"I purchased these for a Harvest Fair game at our preschool. Three year-olds aren't too picky, but I wouldn't buy these again.",2.0
These bean bags are probably okay as a toy but they will not be useful if you are looking for a bean bag to rest a camera on or if you are looking for a bean bag to use as any other kind of cushioning device (I was making a hat stand) these bean bags will not suffice. They don't have very much filling.,2.0
"These were the least expensive set of bean bags I found.  If I had seen them in a store there is no way I would have purchased them.

Too many times have I summoned the monkey apocalypse ravaging death by toppling over the traditional ill-balanced monkey worlds.  I purchased the magic castle because the round base of the castle appeared to be a solid and stable foundation, one in which the monkey Peter could build a church to ward off the careless gyrations of their insane deity.  To this end, the magic castle served its purpose faithfully. However the fatal flaw of the castle lies in its miniscule dome-like opening which confines the monkeys' exposure to oxygen slowly and callously depriving them of life.  As I am a benevolent god, the cruelty of this ""magical"" world was denied to my monkeys as they were lacking enough air for Genesis -- stillborn into their primordial ooze.  Desponded and despaired, I await the evaporation of The Flood so that I may resurrect the corpses of my fallen children in some sort of necromancer zombie-monkey darkness.  Sitting in my throne, snorting lines from the mysterious packet of powdery Amazing Plasma III to invoke visions of The Second Coming, I puzzle at what evil denied the inclusion of the thousand-bubble aerator to the Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys Magic Castle.  There are dark things at work beyond the light visions of the Creator.",2.0
"The least expensive cooperative game but you get what you pay for.  The game pieces are so small that they are difficult to handle.  The slightest breeze, cough or jiggled table,  and they fly away.  Very similar to other ""matching"" games that cost $3-$4 more.  Putting this in the community yard sale for 50cents.  Hope it will sell",2.0
My kids said this was boring. It also looks like it's from the 1970s.,2.0
"My husband and I were disappointed with this drum. We wanted to get a nice floor drum for my young niece, but this drum had a very pronounced and negative high-pitched, ringing overtone. My husband (who happens to be a Juilliard trained percussionist) tried to mute the overtone it by taping a small amount of foam to one corner, but we could not get rid of it, and the ringing sound was pretty annoying. Otherwise, the drum is very well made and sturdy (we own several other Remo drums).  We later returned this drum and ordered the larger 22"" x 8"" Remo Gathering Drum which due to the larger drum head, had a lower, warmer, and more pleasant tone. We realize this is for a toddler, but why not start them off hearing a rich, resonant drum that they can enjoy for years to come, and one which won't give the parents a headache. I would recommend splurging and getting the larger (wider) drum instead.",2.0

"This is the game you would get if Memory and Clue had a baby.  It certainly makes Memory more interesting but I regret this purchase because the quality of the materials so low.  Before you even open it, the game looks cheap.  My kids (5 and 8) helped to pull apart the mini cards and in doing so tore the paper a bit.  It's only a matter of time before they learn that 3 of the clocks they want to avoid have tears on them.  Worse is that the board does not lie flat and so the little cards you  place all over it go sliding around even before the player start turning cards.  Are all Family Pastimes games so poorly constructed?  I'm tempted to make this the last purchase from them.  The two Peaceable Kingdom games I own have much better construction which goes a long way when trying to play a game with little kids who get frustrated easily.  I'm so sorry I bought this game.  If you are considering it, don't bother.",2.0
"This game is basically memory with a useless board.  The board part of the game is there to track the time cards and valuable cards, however, looking at the board you would think that you need to move a player through the house (kind of like clue).  The game pieces are not well made, small and easy to lose/rip.  The cover of the game is very pixelated and looks cheap.  I would suggest buying a peaceable kingdom game, it has better graphics, a better story line, and better use of the materials given.  Young children do like this game, but it was a bit of a bore for adults.",2.0
"Delivery was timely, but game is of very poor quality. The concept is good, but the game board was warped and would not lay flat, rendering is pretty useless since the cards you are supposed to place on it won't lay flat and all slide toward the middle. The playing cards are extremely thin, small and flimsy and will not last long. The image on the box of the game is pixilated. This would be a good game if the items were more durable.",2.0
"I'm sorry I really, really wanted to like this game.  I have hesitated to buy it.  I am a Speech-Language Pathologist and I am ""known"" for the great games I bring to my sessions.  I was disappointed long before I showed it to any of the kiddos I work for.  The game is cheaply made.  :(  Very poor quality!  The game board is warped.  The pieces don't all pop out and I'm guessing this is an issue because there is note that says not to force them but to have scissors to cut them with.  REALLY!  I often like the kids to help me learn a new game.  If I had done that with this one, they would have torn the pieces.  The board with all the pieces is very visually difficult.  I live on an island in remote Alaska and was so excited to get this game.  Running errands ahead of a storm or hoping the ploughs and sanders was out is something the kids could relate to.  I'm sorry very disappointed",2.0

The overall compostion of the game is so cheap. It is like it was made on a copy machine. The cards are paper thin, and will not last over time. After setting up the game, many of the cards were already bent.

Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated. Maybe I'm impatient, but I just did not get it.

There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made. I'm just not sure that this is one of them.",2.0
"We've had the game for almost a year and we've only played it when it arrived.  Frankly, my 5 year old daughter and I didn't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews.  Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy (has a home made feel) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things.  My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software, which we love.  So, this game is not much fun, not well made, not very stimulating, yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it!",2.0

BUT you are suppose to press down and see the number.  It is so faint you can hardly see it!  I mean you couldn't have used a very dark black ink so it would show up?  I would rather it be battery operated and lit up!  I have to send it to him now as too late to return as I leave for out of town tomorrow.  Did I get a dud ?  Did everyone else's come with a dark number you can see easily?  As much as I like the concept I would definitely by pass this toy.  Which is a shame because they could have fixed so easily.",2.0

"I bought this because I remember wanting one when I was younger - and I thought it would be better than flash cards since- flash cards tend to go missing or bend and tear.

I only had it for less than a month and I had hoped it would last longer.",2.0

I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times.

I'm only givin 2 stars now as I just received our butterfly kit and luckily it wasn't too damaged during shipping. Arriving in original box only it has a huge gash on the side and was totally crumpled everywhere else. The nylon habitat had a couple defects to it (none big enough to affect the main purpose in hopeful). I wanted to give it only 1 star if that do to the price $15 for just the habitat and a voucher....which you end up lying another $15 for the butterfly larva...so now we pay AGAIN and wait AGAIN..... I will have to re-review when we finally get everything and grow something...fingers crossed it was all worth the beginning disappointment.,2.0

Then the three large caterpillars began and ended their metamorphosis before the smaller one even started. We moved the lid to the butterfly habitat when the three butterflies started emerging. At first we moved the remaining caterpillar over, but we decided to put him back in the jar with a piece of cardboard for a lid. Hoping to get the lid cleaned off and back on the jar before the little guy starts his metamorphosis. The butterflies are still hanging out on the lid and we don't want to shock them too much.",2.0
"Hello,

I brought this product recently, description is good, product got delivered to me on time in US. i brought this to UK when my son lives and from the time i opened the battery product it doesnt seem to be charging at all. not sure whether we need to change or use an different adaptor while in UK. at the moment its of no use for him and i am very disappointed.

i don't find the adaptor or battery heating up even after a full night charge when i use it in the toy it doesnt move at all. so my 4 yr son still waits for his toy to work.

not sure whether there is a solution if not then probably i will return this as soon as possible.",2.0
"We purchased a Tyco RF controlled vehicle only to find out after we had given it as a present that it required this separate battery pack.  Guess that the packaging does say so in the fine print but didn't realize it at the time.  This battery pack and charger were a third again the cost of the toy. It takes several hours to fully charge then doesn't last very long so needs to be recharged often. Since the battery runs out often, the kids loose interest or end up playing with toy manually, just pushing it around.  I'm sure it will break shortly because of this and toy/battery/charger will end up in garbage shortly.",2.0
"This is easy to put together, a good size, easy to transport/store, but the opening is Velcro!! Why??! As soon as your baby can crawl/stand they'll push right out of it.

"I was in a rush when I ordered this and just picked Amazon's choice because it was the least expensive. The kit itself seems fine but there aren't any caterpillars in it. I'm not sure why would anyone want a butterfly kit without caterpillars, which is what I thought I was getting. It's my own fault for not reading the description clearly but the other ones I looked at looked were from the same company and looked the same and they had caterpillars, so I guess I just assumed this one did as well. Now I have to order them separately and pay $7.95 for shipping. I could have just gotten them all together and paid a little less overall for it. Now I don't know if they'll be here in time for my son's birthday. I would not recommend this kit. Buy the one with caterpillars instead.",2.0

"I purchased this product for my school, and I am disappointed.  It seems like Insect Lore didn't want to lose their great reviews for this product, so they just changed the product information, rather than creating a new product.  This item no longer ships with caterpillars.  The reviews and Q&A is confusing and leads you to believe otherwise.  You really have to search to find that information out.  The questions about caterpillars are not at all related to this product.  Essentially, you're paying $19.99 for a net and a voucher (worth $10).  You will have to pay an additional $8 for S&H.

The mat is large enough, but the material comes rolled up and wouldn't lie flat on the table.
Now I must find a large flat area to lay it and hope it flattens out.
A hard, folded board would have worked much better.
Also, the finish on the mat is glossy and glared under our overhead lighting, making it hard to see the cards on the mat.
Two stacks of cards came sealed in plastic and fit well in the box's designated spots.
However, once the cards were unsealed and used, they no longer would fit in their spots.

The button to its right does read correctly, 1x2 = 2.  My 8 year old caught the mistake.  I've posted pictures above to show you this error.

As other reviewers have stated, the answers can be difficult to see.  The translucent buttons are a little too opaque for easy reading.  At least my children's fingers are smaller than mine and they are able to move them out of the way to see the answer.  Also, the fact is simply painted on top to rub off with repeated use.  I also posted a picture to demonstrate the view of the answers.

I thought that this was something you could put together once and then just fold down and have it pop up over and over again but it's not.  You have to put it together and take it a part each time you want to use it.  Not what I was looking for but very cute and I like the fact that it has SPF.,2.0
Not as described. The listing says it comes with a voucher for caterpillars but I received no voucher or any other paperwork for that matter. Just the habitat and a box for ~$20.,2.0
"The kids really like matching the parts of the eggs.  They are kind of cheap, and the kids struggle to open them but, the ""cartons"" are worthless. Don't plan on using the cartons. They ship the item in a cardboard sleeve, so the edges of the carton had pieces cracked on when there were delivered. Very low quality. Once again, the old ones from the 80's were much better quality.",2.0
The tent was not easy to put together. I brought it to the beach and the wind was a killer with trying to get the poles into their spots. You definitely need more than one person to put it together.,2.0

"Good idea. Bad design. The eggs are hard to open (even for adults). The case is cheap plastic. The latch is tricky to use. My child wants to like this product, but she keeps getting frustrated.",2.0
"To be exact, this is what you get:

1 chimney
2 vertical sign holders
2 rood ridges
2 tripple/flat
6 roof slats (3 green+3 yellow)
8 tripple round
2 double & half
20 doubles
70 singles (barrels)

I hope you like building with singles because there areNot very many big pieces.
The set is wooden.  The review saying that they are plastic is wrong.",2.0
We bought this in hopes of having a shady place for our 9 month old to play.... didn't work out so well. The posts don't go together once they have come in contact with sand. Mostly my fault since it wasn't designed for the beach. So I cleaned it (no easy task!) and set it up in doors as a play house. My then 10 month old tore the fabric at the seams and broke a pole in half when she grabbed it.,2.0
"This is basically the net cage, a pipette, and a half price voucher for the cup of caterpillars. THE PRICE OF THE CATERPILLARS IS NOT INCLUDED. They haven't even told me how many I should expect. But. My 5 year old is super excited now and I pretty much have to buy the caterpillars for ""a small $8 fee for shipping and handling"".",2.0
"Purchased this tent for my 1 year old granddaughter to use at the beach. Mainly purchased for sun protection & the 1-1/2"" pad it advertised. I was disappointed on both counts. First it does not protect from the sun & the pad was less than 1"" thick. Also there isn't anything to anchor the tent down. Did not meet our needs so it was returned.",2.0
"We got this for my daughter and were able to set it up one time without any trouble, and then the next time one of the poles broke. It is very flimsy and pain to set up. I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it if you are interested in having something that can actually be used or that lasts past a week.",2.0
"It's simply the butterfly holder. You still have to wait an additional 3-5 business days to receive the  caterpillars. This needs to be sold all together, or just go to the store and purchase. In the end it would be the same price. Pretty disappointed.",2.0
"We were eager to use this tent for our 9 month old while on the beach. Within a minute, our baby knocked down the mesh flap-door and a few minutes after that, she tipped the tent over from pressing up against the walls.

I should have paid closer attention to the product description/photos and realized that Velcro would not keep my baby inside when trying to get her to nap. We need something with a zipper. I plan to ship this back next week and get something that can contain my baby, like the Kwik Cabana II.",2.0
"The company is pretty vague on the SPF level of this tent and with so much screen (although nice for a breeze), it can't be very high. The door also does not fully seal (only Velcro spots) so it can't be used as a bug tent either. Given that, I'm not sure of the purpose of the tent. Returned and bought the Schylling sun tent instead.",2.0
"All that is included is the mesh container, a booklet about butterflies, & a voucher to order the insects. Unfortunately, I didn't see that I also must pay shipping of $8 - on top of the $25 I spent for this! This seems overpriced to me. Obviously, I must've missed something, b/c surely the cost beyond the $25 mesh bag would be noted in the info section. Or someone else already complained about this same thing in the reviews. Regardless, the concept is cool (so 2 stars for that), but I have mesh bags. I should've just ordered some butterflies & saved some money. Sigh.",2.0
Additional $7.95 to order caterpillars!  I gave a kit as a gift and ordered an additional one for my kids as we have used these kits before.  The price at the time was $19.99 per kit.  The additional nearly $8 shipping fee is new and should be mentioned boldly and clearly in the online product description (It wasn't as of April 2016).  Now I'm embarrassed that the gift recipient has to pay $7.95 to use her gift.  In addition the mesh habitat is a couple inches shorter than the one we ordered previously and I paid more for the kit this year.,2.0
"we bought this nursery tent to take to the beach with us to protect our 9 month old son from the sun.  we liked the mesh netting which allowed air to flow through the tent.  however, one day was pretty windy and the anchors provided are not sturdy enough to secure it.  the wind toppled it over with our son lying inside. it didn't blow away or very far since we were sitting right next to it, but it still toppled over.  i wouldn't recommend it for a trip to the beach!",2.0
"Wish we'd known that the cost of shipping the caterpillars adds another $7.95 to the price. The size of the habitat has also decreased by 50% size we last purchased this set, which was about 5 years back.  Overall,  a beautiful experience. However, in my opinion,  a very small pop-up net should not cost $20.",2.0
"This is a great product and my kids love it. The reason I'm giving it only two stars is the price increase. I've been ordering this every spring for the last 3 years, sold by InsectLore and fulfilled by Amazon. Last year it cost $12.74 for the kit and when you redeemed the voucher for the caterpillars there was only $5 shipping/handling fee from InsectLore. This year sold by InsectLore and fulfilled by Amazon, the same size kit cost $19.99 and the shipping and handling for the caterpillar voucher cost $7.95 at InsectLore. This type of price increase in just one year is not right. It's not likely that I will order it again next year.",2.0
The price keeps soaring along with the butterflies!  I've purchased these kits for our kindergarten class for at least the past 10 year but based on the increase this year - Caterpillars went from $5 to $7.95 and the kit went from $12 to $19.99 - we will do more of a Do-it-Yourself Science project.  It's definitely not worth that price!,2.0
"This broke before we ever got to use it. Was annoying and difficult to put together. Really small to!! SAve you money, but the big one that shades the whole family.",2.0
I got this for my niece's birthday send to the cross state and she said that it doesn't come with the larvae or the butterflies. I thought that it included everything cuz I've had one for my son before,2.0
Misleading. Does not come with caterpillars. Have to spend more money and wait 2 weeks for the caterpillars. This is just a butterfly cage.,2.0
"It's not worth the money at all, i don't recommend it .",2.0
"The shipping was on time, the product looked good, but I don't like it. Not sure if it was on me or the product but I couldn't get butterflies to grow. A little disappointing for the little cousins. I wouldn't buy this again. But better luck to the next buyer!",2.0
"The container is unhandy. If a chrysalis attaches to the roof, you are unable to open it easily to clean the remaining caterpillars. It is useful for one caterpillar only.",2.0
"Once put together, this tent is exactly what we wanted. The issue is actually getting it assembled. It took two people to get the poles into their holders. We were hoping to bring this to the beach with us but I can't imagine trying to get it set up while our little one is sitting in the sun. I think it's worth it to pay slightly more money and get a pop-up tent.",2.0
didn't like the little board with it.,2.0
"I had a set like this when I was younger and I knew my son would love it.

We ordered this as a birthday present. It arrived on time, and caused a great deal of excitement; however, there was no caterpillar voucher anywhere in the package. I even dug the box out of the garbage to double-check. It took me over a week to get in touch with InsectLore to have the situation rectified, and when they finally sent the caterpillars another week later, they arrived dead. After contacting them about this for FOUR days in a row, and sending them a million pictures of the caterpillars to ""prove it"" to their sales representative, they repeatedly told me to ""keep watching them, they're fine"", even though they were clearly dead.
On the fifth day, I finally received an email code for a new batch from a completely new customer service rep, however, by the time this got worked out, my son had really lost interest in the idea. So now I have this mesh container collecting dust in the back room and an email voucher unused in my inbox.
Maybe next year.",2.0
"We thought a smaller tent would be ideal for a baby, but in actuality you need a bigger tent so you can also be inside with him/her at all times.  Also this tent provides barely any releif from the sun at the beach.

Overall its not a bad tent, just not practical for most situations.  Reccomendation: get a sligtly bigger ten.",2.0
"I like the game, I didn't like the 'deluxe' quality. seemed cheaper than the normal one",2.0
"The loom is a bare-bones loom, and the instructions are difficult even for an adult to understand. My daughter weaved about 8 lines with my help and just lost interest as you constantly need to rethread new yarn because it comes in strands rather than a continuous loop. Waste of money.",2.0
I love this toy and grew up playing a toy just like it.  However; this toy does not stay together.  After every turn you have to manually put the poles back in the holes in order to play again.  It is very annoying and it can also pop out during a turn destroying what you were trying to achieve.  I wouldn't buy this toy again.  I would try another brand that may be put together better.,2.0
"This is a great game, but you're better off buying the Standard Edition of Sequence!  I bought this thinking we were getting a larger playing board, but it's not!  After checking measurements before purchasing, it showed that this version's cushioned, roll-up board is larger.....but it's all sidebar.  The individual cards are only a sixteenth of an inch bigger; which equates to no difference.  And, the roll-up board doesn't lie flat, so you'd need to store it separatedly, flattened out.  The only other difference from the standard edition is that the game chips are two-sided.....supposedly to accentuate completed sequences.....which is no big deal.  We've been playing and sharing this game for nearly twenty years, so don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not panning the game itself.
I highly recommend purchasing Sequence.  I just don't recommend this version.",2.0
That it's not a board that it's a roll up material that the back collects dust hair ect... Don't like it.. It doesn't like to lie flat either. Don't recommend this edition. But the we love the game itself.,2.0

"My son loves Thomas the Train and we have a number of pieces from the Take-Along set.  A friend gave this set to him for Christmas and it is awful.  The track is very difficult to put together and the directions are very poor.  My son has been so frustrated by this toy that I am tempted to put it away.  If you are going to buy Thomas the Train products, I recommend the wooden trains or the Take Along trains -- they are made with a higher quality and are easier for children to enjoy.",2.0
I went through 2 of these before I quit and bought something different. It is poorly made. The trains come off the tracks and it doesn't work correctly. I was very disappointed with the quality and with having to explain two times to my son that it was broken.,2.0
"My daughter received the big loader set for christmas.  I had seen many of the other reviews discouraging from purchasing it, but she really wanted it.  She loved it!  It went together very quickly and she loved watching the trains pass from one to the other.  A major complaint was there was only one train, but once we saw how it worked it made perfect sense.  She played with it everynight for the first week.  At times the engines would become stuck, but my daughter didn't seem to mind.  She thought it was fun to give them a genlte nudge.  Then it just stopped working!!  We tried changing the batteries, but to no avail.  I tried writing to the company and heard nothing back.  All is needed is a new motor, but how to get one?  She was heartbroken and I was highly disappointed that the company could not take the time to answer my letter.  While I feel that this is a lot of fun for children it doesn't seem to last very long.  How sad the track sits it the bag.  I hope that others that purchase this item have better luck than we do.",2.0
"I am very unsatisfied with the portable play tent.  I bought for my 9 month old son for outside in our backyard and for an upcoming trip to the beach.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to take to the beach if the company doesn't help me out!!  First of all, I was disappointed that the outside flap is secured in five places with velcro.  A 9 month old is old enough to figure out how to get out of the tent when velcro is the only thing between him and the outside.  The writeup on Amazon said that the tent was for kids birth-3 years.  On the outside of the tent box, it says that it is for babies birth-9 months.  Also, when I put the tent up the last time, the pole splintered in the middle, so I cannot use the play tent at all now.  I have not called the company yet, but I am hoping that they replace the pole at no cost to me.  We have only used the tent 3 times.  I have a different tent for my older son, so I already knew how to use the poles, so the pole did not break because I didn't know what I was doing.  I think it was just defective.  Overall, I think the tent is a waste of money, but I would like to be able to use mine since I have already wasted my money!",2.0
"I bought this for my 4yr old grandson. He was bored with it in 5 min. All you can do is watch. The trains all work off the same motoried base, so they cannot be played with off the track. It is clearly one of the worst Thomas toys.",2.0
"My son received this toy as a Christmas gift, and we were disappointed with it. Once out of the box, we were frustrated with the number of small parts, such as the tiny plastic balls which are used in the loader.  These could be considered a choking hazard for younger children.  Also, there is very little room for ""hands on"" play.  The trains merely move around the track by themselves.  My son became very frustrated with this and wanted to push the trains himself.  I had to tell him that he would break it if he pushed them.  I recommend that you purchase one of the excellent Thomas wooden train sets.  They are much better than this set and allow for much more interactive play.",2.0
it was not clearly described that you have to remove one heddle then reinsert it onto the warp. my granddaughter has difficulty in doing this step.,2.0
Cheap design,2.0
"We took this to the beach and didn't use it once. It got warm inside it and my three month old would not use it. It may be better for him as a toddler or in the house, but not as a baby at the beach. We ended up using a bigger tent that I could sit in and hold him instead.",2.0
"Thomas and his friends, Percy and Terence, they load, fill, scoop, haul, and dump their cargo of ""rocks"" around this bustling construction site. The vehicles move backward or forward, it is automatic when your child chooses which area the engines will go to next. A chute that dumps the load of rocks into Percy's tender and Terence will load Thomas with rocks. It was fun to look at for the first 30 mins but then my 30 months old son gets tired of it. There is no hands on interaction except controlling the loader to go forward or backward. I don't think it is a good, stimulating toy for my son!!!",2.0
"My 3-year old son received this toy for his birthday.  Although he does enjoy watching the action, it ends up being very frustrating!  The trains rarely make more than two circuits before jumping the track or one of the train bodies fall off. Since the engine is battery powered and still running, it is difficult to replace on the track.
The Big Loader Set does provide interesting watching but little  hands-on interaction for the child. A small bump will cause either the train body to dislodge or the train engine to jump the track.",2.0
"I hate to write a negative review...I had such high hopes for this little tent.  But the truth is, there is no way to secure it in the sand or prevent your little guy or girl from tipping it over again and again.

The tent itself seems very strong and well-made.  However, the poles don't dig down into the sand, and there are no pouches on it to fill with sand to weight it down.  From what I hear, the Infant Cabana from One Step Ahead (although more costly) is a much better way to go.  I guess you get what you pay for.

My son was able to play with his toys in this tent, but once he saw people outside, he was pushing on the mesh screens to try and get to us, and the tent just kept tipping over.  Very frustrating and NOT relaxing at all.  We spent a week at the beach and used it only once before we realized it was pretty much useless.

If I had it to do over again...I'd try One Step Ahead.  I've never been disappointed by them.  Should've known better.",2.0
The bed look great.  However it is a pain try to put together.  The unit I got have no hole pre-drilled.  We ended up drilling a few hole to get the screw in. Some part don't fit right and you need to drill a few more hole to make it fit.  Overall it is not that good.,2.0
Do t like.,2.0
"This looks like an excellent product except that when I went to order my ""free"" caterpillars, there was mention of a $5 shipping fee on the coupon. This is not a tremendous fee, but it's nearly 40% of the cost of the original product. Once I had my caterpillars in my cart, the website recommended 2nd day shipping, which is actually $20, so the ""$12"" butterfly garden is actually ""$32"", nearly three times the original cost!",2.0
"The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated.  It is very colorful and well worth the price.  The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it.  But I am very pleased with the quality.",2.0
The front loader has too much plastic on it. 10 years ago it would have been made mainly of metal and very little plastic used. Of course today it is all about maximizing profits at the sake of durability. Steer Clear. There are still products like this made from metal on the market and I would rather pay a little extra for the quality. Obviously Tonka has lost touch with its customer base.,2.0
"I purchased this vehicle for my 2/year old grandson.  After investing in the Might Tonka dump truck I foolishly assumed this toy would be of equal durability and value - especially in light of the investment of over $50.  It arrived in a crushed box, NOT in original packaging, and without an original receipt.  A photocopy of a 'lifetime guarantee' was tossed inside the box and the loader was sliding around along with some crumpled paper.  The wheels are plastic, the decals are crooked and wrinkled, and I do not feel this at all lives up to the TONKA reputation.  I am terribly disappointed and will NEVER buy this type of toy on line again as it is NOT at all what I expected.  Buyer BEWARE !!!",2.0
"Cheap plastic paired with super thin sheet metal.  But quite simply, the worst part of this toy is the plastic hinge used for the bucket lever.  It was broken within a day, rendering the entire toy quite useless.  Even prior to breaking, the bucket wouldn't stay elevated even under it's own weight.  I can't imagine what a full load of dirt would do.
I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone, period.",2.0
Warning this does not come with the caterpillars or food. You will need to mail in a certificate and $5. Not worth the money.,2.0
It came with a certificate for 5 caterpillars.  There were 4. 2 made it to butterfly stage and quickly died. Very disappointed.,2.0
"I bought this for my son for Christmas and became way more interested in it than he did.  I followed the directions exactly, but I only got a few to hatch and they died within a couple of days (yes, I aerated the tank and did not overfeed).  My sea monkeys never got anywhere near as large as the ones in the customer images.

One possible reason for this is that the light would not stay lit.  Every time I put in new batteries the light would only last a couple of hours. I tried at least four sets of batteries before I gave up. I will probably try again, but I would not buy this particular tank because I believe that the light was defective.  I suggest another tank, but I think every kid should have sea monkeys at least once in their lifetime.",2.0
It's a great game but I don't understand why it's so expensive when a  retail store has it in stock for $7.77. This price is way too high for this game.,2.0
"This is a great concept, but I was frustrated when I got my caterpillars out of the mailbox to find that they were already starting to form their chrysalis, and were not attached to the top. Several caterpillars died, and at best I am hoping for one butterfly. This is disappointing because I am a teacher and my whole class was excited about this. Plus I paid over $20 for one possibly butterfly, which is a bit frustrating.",2.0
This great sounding product will end up costing you double the original price if you follow the 'strongly suggested' instructions that are not clearly advertised. You won'the find the hidden expense until the kit arrives and you read the enclosed instructions on how to receive your 'live larvae '. If you follow the advertised larvae ordering route the instructions imply the larvae have little chance of survival. Now they tell you!,2.0
The box was completely missing the live caterpillar certificate!!!,2.0
"I was highly disappointed in this. While the netting was great, there is a false advertising that there is a voucher inside to claim your larvae. Yes there is a voucher inside but you have to pay additional shipping costs above all the money already spent, just to get larvae.",2.0
"I really didn't like the cardboard box and the bold print saying, Live Butterfly Garden, ""Live Caterpillars Mailed Directly to You."" There isn't anything alive in the box. Granted, it is made clear in the finer print details that you need to have the certificate code, and then, the caterpillars will be mailed to you. The $15.99 box comes with nothing but the net mesh pop-up container, a plastic dropper, and the certificate with the code. You have to go to the website and type in the certificate code and you can only do this one certificate at a time, or it won't work. They say on the site, that if you want to do more than one at a time, you have to mail in the certificates, and there will be a processing fee for doing so. Therefore, the only real option is that you have to enter in the code and check-out completely, one painful certificate at a time. If you are on a time crunch like I am with my students (I want this project to come to completion before the end of the semester), then you have to pay for 2 day air. This faster shipping method is $18.95. You can only claim one certificate at a time, so that means that you would have to pay $18.95/kit. I only did this for one of the kits and paid the slower shipping (10 business days for $5.00) for all the other kits. I think for the casual speed shoppers out there, this kit is very misleading. I really was excited, because it was so affordable, easy, complete with everything I would need, and so quick to order. The reality is so much sadder; I am very tempted to just go outside and hunt for my own darn caterpillars.",2.0
3 minutes of setup. 30 seconds of fun. I loathe when the kids pull this game out.,2.0
The game came without mallets and the blue board when assembled once can't be taken apart. This game was a Christmas present for my 9-year niece and she got so disappointed with the condition of the game.,2.0
"I have not used my butterfly gardens yet, but I have high hopes that it is going to be amazing.  The negative review is because the enclosed certificate is basically useless.  I ordered 3 of these and 3 of the Ladybug farms and my certificates did not work because you are not allowed to bundle the certificates with any other products.  Ie - Maybe the certificates work if you redeem them INDIVIDUALLY with no other products, but otherwise no go.  This is a problem if you are buying more than one because you need to have them shipped 2nd day air.  Obviously, if you don't bundle the order, you'll spend more than the certificates are worth in shipping.  If you do standard lead-time, from the time you order until the time you have a hatched butterfly is about 5 to 8 weeks.  I just dropped another $150 on actual bug larvae in addition to the gardens/farms I purchased.",2.0
Seems like a scam.  Caterpillars are not included.  Need order them and for another $5.,2.0
Only one butterfly hatched.  Pretty much of a let down. Maybe it was a fluke but I wouldn't order this again.,2.0
"My daughter loves butterflies and hatched about 10 last butterfly season from a home we made ourselves.  It was just a large plastic jar we poked holes in but it wasn't ventilated well enough so when i saw this one I thought it would be perfect and bought one for her and two friends for their birthdays.
It would be perfect except the caterpillars form their chrysalis's on the lid (even though we tried putting other things in the home for them to use).  Two problems with that.  One if you pick the cage up the chrysalis falls off off the lid.  Two became injured this way and had damaged wings.  We have been taking care of one for two weeks because it can't fly.
The other problem  is the only way to feed the caterpillars is to unzip the top.  So getting new leaves in and taking old leaves out becomes very difficult because you don't want to bump any of the chrysalis's.  Now I have a cage full of dead leaves and poop.  Oddly the poop doesn't stink but the old leaves do. (They are monarch butterflies we found ourselves, we didn't get them from the company)
If there was a better way to get food in and out and a way to clean the cage it would be a better home.",2.0

"Cool tent for little kids, too bad 1 of the pole bent after about 3 months... now the tent can't stand up, unusable... can't find replacement, cant fix with duct tape either...",2.0
"I had this game as a child. Yes I found it odd that there were far more men than women, but I don't remember it being a horrid thing nor do I remember thinking ""oh, women must not be as valuable"". I think that's taking it a bit far, it's just a game with cartoon faces. I liked the silly beards, hats, faces etc. When we were a bit older 7+ or so we banned the gender question all together because it made the game last longer and we had to ask more specific questions, such as ""does your person have long eyelashes?"" or ""does your person have rosey cheeks?"". It was a fun game, one I remember very fondly, so of course I was excited to see this on the shelf at my local toy store. I purchased the latest version of Guess Who? for my kids. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this game. Flimsy paper pictures of the characters, cheap plastic tiles for the game board, the game board itself where all the small plastic tile with pictures go was crappy low quality plastic. The plastic tile pieces just snap on, but do NOT stay on. They pop off constantly in the middle of the game, which screws up the game if you try and put it on then three other faces fall or pop off in the process, OR they go on crooked. even when you flip the tiles down there is an issue. The row in front is too close to the row behind so when you flip a tile down from the back rows they land on or get stuck on the row in front of them...meaning you have to move the front tile up so the back tile will go down. That causes, of course, the tiles in front to pop off sometimes.
I don't know why or when they changed the style of this game but it's a complete RIP OFF. The game I played as a child was well made with a thick plastic base, and tiles that were hooked WELL into the base, the tiles never bumped each other as you flipped them down, and the pictures rested securely and flat inside each tile, not bowed out and folded (after much use) in the tiles.

This game is SUCH a waste of money. I will now begin what I'm sure is a long search for an original game from 1989-1995 through collectors, eBay and other places where I might find an original. I'm so disgusted that this is the way things have gone w/toys and games these days. Cheap materials, crappy workmanship, POOR execution in design and a jacked up price-tag!",2.0
"This is poorly designed. It is very diffiult to get the cards in the holders and then cards fall out of the holders repeatedly.  There are only 4 or 5 female faces so picking a female is too easy and takes only a few turns to guess.  The instructions are vague with 4 holders having plastic that needs to be popped out of center to use properly.  The idea of the game is great.  The execution is terrible for the above reasons.  There are no replacement cards with other subjects so I can expect this game will become relatively useless as the children learn the characteristics of the men; the women, as I said, are easy to identify since there are so few of them.  If any thing this game should come with other sets of card with different subjects to widen the use of the game by varying the subjects which you guess, but this is almost impossible to do on your own by printing from the manufacturer website as the pictures must be printed on cardboard to be stiff enough to insert into the card holders..so what is the purchaser to do?  I guess you buy this , spending money on a game that should be useful for a long period of time, knowing that it will not be, and it is hard to believe that this game has not been panned for the above reasons long before my purchase.",2.0

I was so disappointed.  I had this game for my children when they were young and they loved it.  I purchased it for my grandson and when we opened it it was cardboard and plastic that you had to take apart and put together and it kept falling apart.  Playing the game was no fun because the cardboard pieces of faces kept falling out of the holders and the holders didn't flip down or up all the way.  It because such a trial for a 6 year old we just put it away. It was a waste of money.  And of course there is no way to know before you get it and look at it.,2.0
"After paying $16 for this game, I was very surprised that Hasbro requires their customers to complete the game construction that Hasbro chose to skip at the factory. What's the $16 dollars for?  The box contains maybe $1 in flimsy materials.  While my eager children waited, it took over an hour for me to assemble the game.  Even then, the face cards continued to slide out of the ill-fitted slots.",2.0
"I remember this game from my own childhood and was pleased to have it sent as a present for my own daughter for Christmas UNTIL we opened it and tried to put it together - VERY FIDDLY, took over an hour with poorly made cardboard and plastic pieces.

"An old favorite of mine as a child, I bought this for my 4 yr-old a few months ago hoping he would enjoy it as much as my sister and I had. Right from the beginning, it wasn't exactly as I remembered.

The original style of the game came with the boards already put together but the ones in this set you have to put together yourself. All the windows have to be separated from plastic and then the cards have to be inserted, which takes some time. That alone wouldn't be a problem, except the cards are flimsy and kept popping out of the tiles as I was trying to put them in because the tiles are curved and you have to bend the card through and under little plastic bars otherwise they fall out all the time. The original one had flat tiles, which would be a great improvement to make to this game.

The plastic is also VERY cheap; some of the tiny pegs that connect the tiles to the boards bent or broke during the very first game, meaning the tiles no longer go all the way down without popping out or won't stay up at all. We kept having to stop after nearly every turn to sort the tiles and boards out which was a real shame: what 4-yr old is going to wait around while Mummy sorts the tiles out for the tenth time? Not mine! My son found it very frustrating too; he would try to push the tiles up or down after they came loose but they kept falling out of the board and he couldn't snap them back in without knocking over an handful of the other tiles! We had to keep starting the game over. Even I had the same problem, so helping him didn't actually help much!

The pictures are good, however. The faces have been updated and are a lot of fun. Some of the expressions are subtle; older children would probably have a much easier time of determining whether a face has a smile or a grimace! Once my son got used to the faces, however, he did fine. He still occasionally wants to play the game but he does get fed up pretty quickly and back in the cupboard it goes.

**TIP: If you are considering purchasing this for a younger child, I would recommend putting the tiles in the same locations on both boards. Then you can 'help' them if they accidentally turn down the wrong people... you'll have your own board to refer to :-)

Maybe we got a defective set? The low ratings I've given this particular version are obviously based on our limited experience with this particular set. If it had been the original I used to have, it would get five stars all round as a game in general. My sister and I would play for hours! I am now hunting on eBay for an original if for no other reason than to compare.

Overall, I just don't know why the manufacturer felt the need to 'modernize' something that was fine as it was. Don't fix it if it 'aint broken, right?

I hope this review helps you with your purchase ... maybe you'll have better luck than we did :-)",2.0
"This idea of this toy is GREAT!  It is very educational.  Teaches kids to think and form questions, stratigies.  I had this toy growing up and we loved it and it was durable.  My daughter got it for her 7th birthday last week and I already took it back because it is made so cheaply now.  It does not stay together.  A few of the piece's moldings were not straight so you can't get the pieces to stay on the main board.  WHen you go to flip up all the characters usually at least 3 fall off the main board.  Very frustrating.",2.0

"First of all let me say I love and have always loved playing Milton Bradley games (as an adult, and as a child), so with that said, here's the purpose of this review. As a mother of two children I'm always trying to find new and old ways to entertain them, and now that my oldest is at the age to play board games I went and bought the classic ""Guess Who"". I can't express how disgusted I am at how cheap and so very time consuming this new and cheaper to manufacture game is. It takes more time to ""fix"" the game pieces every time the box is opened then it does to play the actual game, and as a consumer I would rather pay a few dollars more to have a better quality product (the kind of product I grew up knowing). Not everything has to change over time, and it's sad that this fine company as done just that!",2.0
"This is a really great simple game idea ideal for the little ones - my 4 and 6 year old are great fans.

Only problem is that the game is so terribly made that less than 3 weeks after getting it I'm ready to throw it at the wall from frustration. It took about half an hour to pop all the little plastic and cardboard bits into place, which wouldn't be a problem except that the darn things fall off and the cardboard bits fall out constantly - breathing on this thing wrong is enough to mess it up and require a parent to have to come in and fix it.  Had it not been for how cheaply made this game is, I would be heartily recommending it. Shame really, because as a concept it's a really simple and very good idea.",2.0

"All of the caterpillars were dead.  Don't pay for dead butterflies/caterpillars, unless you can get it for maybe 90% off with Free Shipping.  Then you could just use it as garden fertilizer maybe.

"I got this game for my daughter for Christmas and put it together tonight.  It is VERY cheaply made.  The pieces that you ""flip up and down"" will not stay on, they're constantly falling off and having to fix them every ten seconds takes the fun out of the game.  The concept itself is fun and great for kids, but it's sad how greedy manufacturers are these days, it could be made much better.",2.0
"I do not recommend this game and cannot understand the 4.5 star average rating.  Yes, my kids enjoy it.  However, it is so poorly put together that its just really, really annoying to play.  The plastic pieces routinely fall over, or come off entirely.  The person pictures come out quite easily unless you tape them in place, and if you tape them they may not flip properly.  It takes maybe 30-60 seconds of ""set up"" time to play a 2-4 minute game.  While this isn't the end of the world, I personally find it quite annoying.

Here is how the game works:  there are around 30 or 40 faces in the game.  Each player randomly picks one card from the 40.  Each player has a rack which includes cards for all the faces which are turned away from the opposing player so that only you can see the faces in your rack.  Each trait (for example gender) is split so that there is a minority (i.e. there are only 6ish female faces, and 6ish black faces, etc...) and a majority (the remaining faces -- i.e. 20+ are male, 20+ are white, etc...).  There are around 10 or so traits, all with this majority/minority trend -- gender, race, glasses, hats, bald, facial hair, etc...  Every person seems to have at least one or more minority traits (i.e. its a man, but he is bald, or wearing a hat.)  You ask a question, ie ""is it a girl"" and, depending on the answer, flip over the boys/girls on your rack to eliminate them, and by process of elimination, and by asking more questions eg ""is the person bald"" work down till there is only one person on your rack, which must be the person the opposing player picked.  Whoever gets down to one left on their rack first (i.e. figures out who the other player picked first) wins.  Getting lucky and picking the right minority trait to ask about is more useful than good logic.

I'm not overly PC or anything, but I just cant warm to a game the whole purpose of which is asking questions designed to exclude people with minority traits, so you can, by process of elimination, figure out who is left.

Moreover, the concept is so simple that I don't think the game is very educational.  The kids (even the very young) quickly learn the basic concept.  Once they learn it, there isn't any real learning left to do.  (Yes, its true an adult can use more advanced logic to pick the ""best"" questions, but good luck explaining that to a young kid.  Indeed, I bet there are plenty of adults that would not understand the logic behind selecting an optimal question.)

"My 6yr old played an older version at a relative's house and was excited to use his allowance to buy one of his own.  Sadly, it was a waste.  The cards constantly fell out of place, making game play difficult.  Also the plastic pieces broke because my children (who are in NO way destructive)continuously replaced the cards.  After about 2 rounds they asked to put it in the donation box for the Salvation Army.  If any good came of it, it was the discussion I had with them about only giving away nice things, not junk, to charity.  The game went in the trash... where it belongs!  And they wrote a long letter to the manufacturer.  We were mailed coupons to buy more crappy games.  Thanks guys!",2.0

"Welcome to the cruel and revolting world of butterfly rearing!

Honestly, what I thought would be a fun and interesting project for my younger sisters, turned out to be a glimpse into what bug torture looks like.

First of all, they are cooped up in the little cup pooping and eating in the same place. Second, once they become chrysalides there is no clear way to 'pin' them to the top of the enclosure. Third, when they emerge they release a LOT of red goop. Like too much. It stained the enclosure and our tablecloth. They seemed to live miserable existences, so we let them go after a day. Never doing it again.",2.0
Works fine for kids who are more reserved.  It was fun for them to hide in and play.  But it does not withstand being moved often and kids who ruff house.

"Aggravation is one of those eternal classics, and is also known as Wahoo (Parchisi is another variant of the same basic concept).  Unfortunately, this edition is not.  The board is cheaply made and rather hideous to look at (I guess that's all at the expense of ""being cool"").  This board has been out since the 1990s, and it's rather sad this is the only model currently available on the market that I know of.  The game goes much faster because of how wonky the marble path is around each home colour (purple, red, etc). The board itself is cheaply made and starts comes apart pretty easily.  Also, this board is aimed squarely at little kids, and Wahoo is one of those games that adults can play with equal pleasure.

I have an Aggravation board from the 1980s, and that board looks so much more stylish.  I wish they had that.

If you are wanting a good board, don't get this one.  There are plenty of home made wooden boards available on Ebay and other sources.  In the past few years I have bought two different wooden boards off Ebay that were dual sided.  One side had a four player version and the other side had a six player version for my wife's grandma who loves Wahoo.  I bought a second one from the same vendor a year or two later with an 8 player game on one side and a 4 player game on the second side.  The quality of these boards are great, strong, and durable.

Trust me, if you like Wahoo/Aggravation, a wooden board is definitely the way to go!  Much classier and much more appealing to adults as well as kids!",2.0
"I loved playing Aggravation as a kid.  Countless hours at the dinning room table returned memories to last a lifetime.  With the ""new"" board, I dread my kids choosing this game.  The board is confusing, the shapes are distracting, and generally I find we think more about where we are supposed to go next than clearly considering strategy.  I wouldn't even consider this game with a child or adult who had sensory, vision, or comprehension challenges.  This board design is a failure on the part of the design team.  Someone forgot to tell you that simple is best.

On the bright side, I can always hope that I win the bidding war with my sisters for the set that has been in the family for 40 years!",2.0
I use to get this kit with the caterpillars being extremely small. Now both orders had caterpillars that were very big and went into crystal is in one week. The class missed each part of lifecycle.,2.0
"Personally, I would give this game only one star, but my 5 year old enjoys it so I bumped it up to two stars because his opinion does count for something.

First, the game is made pretty poorly. The plastic ""marbles"" are very lightweight and tend to roll out of their holes very easily. The game board itself is made of cheap cardboard and doesn't always lay flat. The whole thing just has a very cheap feel, especially for something that's being sold for almost $30.00.

Second, the game itself just isn't that much fun. It just drags on forever, or at least it feels like it does. And I'm not one of those parents who minds playing childrens games with their children. I'm a stay at home father who happily plays all manner of games with my five year old; this one is just plain boring.

If you're looking for a game similar to Aggravation - i.e., one of those games where you enter the board from your Base, go around the board with the possibility of landing on an opponent's piece and sending them back to their Base, and then try to enter your Home (usually by exact count) - then Sorry (or even Sorry Spin) would be a MUCH better choice. It's just a better thought-out game with more opportunities to try a strategy once your child is old enough for that kind of thing. Even without the strategy, Sorry is just more fun to play.

Once your child is a bit older, then get Parcheesi: the original game on which all of these other games are essentially based. It's MUCH more interesting with MUCH more opportunity for strategical thinking and playing.

Aggravation is little more than mindless moving your pieces around in a funny-shaped circle. No thought or fun required.",2.0
"Maybe I have grown up a wee bit, did not care for this and loved it as a child.  Would be fun for a very young audience.  Little cheaper in build quality and noisy to play.

"This game fails to hold interest for my three and five year old girls.

It's a classic and they're still excited to play when we bring it out, but they tire within two rounds, which only last about 30 seconds each. Left to their own, they would just like to pound all the ice cubes out as fast as possible, but since it takes a minute or so for an adult to setup, it's not really fun for anyone. There's never any surprise or challenge as to which cube will cause the bear to fall, so it basically feels like a complicated plastic tic-tac-toe game. On our set, the plastic is poorly finished, so the bear doesn't stand/skate in the slot he's meant to. Perhaps it's better to wait till they are old enough for Operation or Kurplunk. For now, PopUp Pirate is the family favorite. If you have other suggestions, please leave a comment.",2.0

"I got this as a gift, and I ordered the cup or caterpillars right away when I got it. As soon as the caterpillars arrived, I watched them move around, eat, and grow every day. Then they started forming their cocoons, and it was very exciting when that happened. When their cocoons were fully-formed, I put the cocoons in the butterfly garden, and I woke up one day to find three little butterflies crawling around and flying in the habitat, which was even more exciting! The next day, the two other ones emerged. I fed them some juicy fruit.
A few days later, I let three of the butterflies fly away. It was sad but happy at the same time to see them go. Sadly, two of the butterflies seemed to have their wings stuck together. I placed both of them on some plants near my porch and went inside for a while.
When I returned, one of the butterflies was gone, and I hopefully concluded that s/he had flown away, but now I have to wonder if something bad happened to it.
I left the other butterfly outside in the dirt for a couple days. I had to bring it inside because, though it was the about the first day of summer, it was getting chilly, and I was worried about the butterfly. So the put the little one in the butterfly garden, fed him/her some fruit, and hoped for the best. The next day, I thought the butterfly had moved some since the night before, but the butterfly wasn't showing any signs of life, and by dusk that day I had to sadly conclude that the butterfly had gone to the Rainbow Bridge. So I went outside, placed the insect in a paper box with some flowers and a leaf, and buried the butterfly, who I named Wesley, by a tree. It was heartbreaking, and I wrote a poem in honor of Wesley.

Bottom line: I thought this was cute and lots of fun, which it sort of was, but the heartbreak involved in it outweighed the fun. Animals, especially tiny and fragile ones like butterflies and caterpillars, are simply not meant to be shipped long distance just like everyday mail. They are living beings, not machines or pieces of paper. You might see lots of positive reviews with people saying they love it, but keep in mind that you might not be so lucky. Please don't buy this. Instead, enjoy living things such as butterflies in the habitats they naturally live in.",2.0

So I bought it and took it home and we played it, and now I see why it was in the clearance bin.  The black holder for the dice, that is supposed to act as a rolling cup is rubbish.  It doesn't stand up, so someone has to be constantly holding it upright or all the dice spill out.  The dice themselves are cheap, lightweight dice that feel like you could crumble them in your bare hands, and I fully expect them to break at some point.

"Why oh why don't I learn to listen to the one-star reviews?! Several customers said the potato head they received was not as pictured. I assumed (wrongly) that they would surely have updated the product photos to reflect the actual product by now. Nope... our Mr. Potato Head came with a completely different (and slightly scary-looking) mouth, and the hat and glasses were completely different.

That, I can live with, but as other reviewers pointed out, the parts don't stay securely in the holes. Mr. Potato comes assembled in the box, but as I was pulling him out, one arm and one ear fell off. So far, the cover of the compartment in back that holds the spare part (the extra mouth) is staying on, and I hope it continues to, but the entire toy feels very cheap and flimsy compared to the Mr. Potato Head I had as a child, so I don't expect this to score high in the long-term durability department.

I gave it two stars because my toddler likes it except for the parts constantly falling out, but I will likely find myself searching the auction sites for a more durable Mr. Potato Head. I'd take the scary-looking version from the 70's over this one.",2.0

"too difficult for an adult to do, never mind a young child.",2.0
Box came crushed and damaged couldn't give as a gift,2.0
This product is not very good... I believe we just got a bad potato... because we have a Mrs potato head too... but the compartment flap doesnt stay on... it falls off all the time... it doesnt hold properly.,2.0
"You pay $15 for this, then when it comes, you have to send out for the butterflies for $12 more!!! Ridiculous!",2.0
"This game has changed. The ants used to look like actual ants, and be easy to get them into the pants however now the ants look horrible and are difficult to get into the pants. I though this would be a quick game to play with my toddler before dinner but it took all of 30 minutes to play one game. Needless to say we will not be playing this one again as she was irritated as was I at the difficulty task of getting four ants in the pants",2.0
I was so excited when I got the butterflies but they all didn't come to full term from their coccoons... very sad a diasspointed... I was going to release them during my sisters wedding...,2.0
"We received the product as described, sent in the extra money for the caterpillars, etc. They showed up about 8 business days later which was disappointing, but nonetheless they were hopeful. We followed the instructions to the letter but 4 out of the 5 butterflies died which was heartbreaking for our daughter who received this as a birthday present.",2.0

of taste or opinion. We did not enjoy this game, but other families may enjoy it.
If I were to give it an age range it would probably be 4-7 years.",2.0
this product is ridiculous i have been your ad doesn't say that u have to pay an extra 5 dollars for the caterpillars.. i was expecting the whole package not just the butterfly garden.. at no point in the description does it state that the butterflies will not be shipped with my package. you should add that piece of information in your product review.,2.0
"My 3-year-old daughter couldn't wait to rip this game out of the box and play. Unfortunately, flicking the ants into the pants was a lot harder than it looked. After 30 minutes we were frustrated by trying and gave up. Later that night, my dad came over and gave it a try. This is a guy who shoots skeet in his spare time - he should know a little bit about aim and trajectory - but after 15 minutes, Grandpa gave up too.

We finally had a little bit of success when we threw away the cardboard dog that goes into the pants and just started chucking (not flicking) the ants at the empty pants. But, even with that, it's a still a game we rarely play.

I'd suggest skipping this one and purchasing the much more fun, much less frustrating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-t-Break-the-Ice/dp/B00000IVZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don't Break the Ice</a>&nbsp;by the same company.",2.0
"i first have to say that Amazon did their job. Service was just what I expected. Quick. Radio Flyer has sold out. For the price of this item my expectations were higher. I purchased this same style wagon in 1987 for my children and I still own it and use it with my grandchildren. It is in great shape still. I decided to buy one for my grandchildren in 2016. The wooden frame to the base portion was made with a cracked piece of wood. This is not acceptable. So I exchanged it. The second one came and had a workmanship crack in the wood base where the weight would be handled in a joint. On both wagons wood base which holds the children is made of a thin piece of wood, paneling thickness. The supports that frame the base are made with low grade wood quality. I can't imagine the poor quality of the red pieces that has been hidden under paint. I am sure this item will not be around in 30 years. All I can say is SHAME ON YOU Radio Flyer, you too have sold out to Asian production and reduced the quality of your materials and workmanship. The only thing that still looks respectable are the four wheels. Please don't stop making solid tires too.",2.0
"i was really disappointed in this product. my daughter wanted it for a science project. the caterpillars arrived a week late. there were 6 of them.\, only one survived to become a butterfly. there was not enough food for all of them to survive. it was not a pretty site.",2.0
"This is an iconic wagon, however, Radio Flyer has really declined in quality. I purchased this one for my grandsons with fond memories of pulling my younger niece and nephew around with a riding mower during the late 60's. I don't think I would trust pulling this one with my two grandsons; something would probably come apart... I got this one through warehouse deals, it was supposed to have only ""minor surface blemishes,"" with no cosmetic damage. This was true until I got to the last part if the assembly; the wheels, two of which were damaged.  The hubs on both wheels had one side bent and misaligned by as much as 10, which prevented the axle from passing through the wheel. I didn't feel like disassembling the entire wagon for a return, so I worked for probably 30 minutes straightening the wheels, which lead to more ""minor surface blemishes,"" but with a little touch up paint I put the damaged hubs towards the inside to hide the cosmetic damage which didn't exist. I think I've learned my lesson with Amazon warehouse deals.",2.0
It arrived scratched and broken...Had to return product and buy new from Target,2.0
My 7-year-old daughter LOVED this game. Too bad it completely stopped working after 5 weeks.,2.0
"We bought this item for our daughter for her birthday, she was very excited! We were appalled to learn we would need to spend more money on this for her to get the caterpillars! And to learn that they would only except a credit card for the added $5 (for shipping and handling) We paid $19.99 and have yet to purchase the caterpillars! I would not recommend the Live Butterfly Garden to anyone unless your willing to pay more once you get it home! I think this cost should be included with the initial purchase of the product! And then I learned that if you purchase this item from their website for $19.99 the caterpillars come with it for no additional charge! I think maybe we will be taking this back to the store and ordering online!",2.0
I thought that the catapiliars came with the set thus we got it. However they do not u have to purchase this kit and than u get a thing you have to mail away for another 5 bucks and than you get your catipillars by the time we finally received them it was too cold outside to use it and not to mention 2 of them passed before arrival! one disappointed child I had.,2.0
"For the money, it sure should have held up better.  We had to configure the thing and even buy a part that must have ""popped off"" somewhere.  Now we had to just hammer in the back side....no longer removable.  What a disappointment. We even found they had stapled parts!  I only purchased this cause our kids had one years ago and it was great.  Bought one for the grandkids then, and no....it's not the same.  Things got cheapened, not cheaper, in the manufacturing.  Buy one that costs less--  my advice.  Even the plastic ones would have made more sense.",2.0
Very cheaply made.  The bucket does not stay centered.,2.0
"The tires were very  crappy  they were out of round and lop sided. The wagon  was okay, but pulled funny  because of the wheels. I wrote to the seller who was supposed to get me more tires but I haven't seen them yet and that was 6 weeks ago. It was a present for our first grand child it was a disappointment to both of us :-(",2.0
I think next time I will order the deluxe set with a turntable board.,2.0
failed to state that the larva is sold seprate and nothing but the case comes in this box.. i was not happy with this NOT worth the price,2.0
barrel sticks,2.0
Disappointed in cheap quality....always tilts one way.,2.0
The game doesn't really set up properly. Then pieces don't nestle right so the pot sits oddly and makes the game less fun.,2.0
"Bought used, posted no blemishes or damage. Back rail came out of box in three pieces. Scotch tape didn't hold. Not happy.",2.0
"Admittedly, I didn't read any of the reviews before purchasing, but I think it's a scam that you buy this kit and then have to pay another $5 for the larvae.",2.0
Spills out of the tray.,2.0
"The wagon as a finished product is good but getting it finished proved to be an ordeal.  One of the wheels that arrived with the wagon had something that was loose inside it so it made an awful noise when rolled.  I called cusomer service and they were quick to send another wheel.  When that wheel arrived it was bent so that the wagon wobbled so it was unusable.  Another call to customer service resulted in finally having a set of four good wheels and a completed wagon.  Given shipping time it took almost 1 month to fix the assembly of the wagon.  This experience shows the decline in quality, and quality control, that Radio Flyer has had.  While my son will enjoy the wagon I couldn't recommend this product to anyone else.  At close to $150 I expect better quality components or at least someone to check the parts before they go in the box.",2.0
"Ok game, but I ask myself why would I want a game that comes with tiny plastic beans? A poor choice if little pieces drive you nuts.",2.0
Not like the original.  Cheaply made.,2.0
"In our family we have played UPWORDS forever and love it! It's fun for all ages and more challenging than Scrabble. However, this new version is not so nice.  Instead of the wonderful old wooden tiles which were large enough to manipulate easily, we now have scaled down size with plastic tiles that are awkward and clumsy, especially for elderly hands.  Please, Hasbro, bring back the old version.  What were you thinking?

I am still looking for the ""old"" version, if anyone knows where I can find one.",2.0
"Ordered this toy for my wife, but was not what we expected upon arrival.  It's ok, but had hoped for a more deluxe edition with bigger playing board.",2.0
"I probably wouldn't buy this again

"The ""pot"" doesn't site level no matter what we try. With that, the game ends after just a couple turns.",2.0
"Game works pretty good but I would not consider this in good condition, it is missing beans and the stickers are all worn off, I would not call this good condition I would say fair or poor. The plastic does not support properly.",2.0
"They just don't make things like they used to.  The pot is off balance from the beginning, rendering the game unplayable except to a little kid who doesn't notice or care.",2.0
Did not suit our purpose,2.0
"Not the game I had as a child, very cheaply made :(",2.0
"We bought this product without ever seeing it first, what a mistake!  Very disappointed at the quality and craftsmanship of this product.  This wagon shakes and rattles when you pull it down the sidewalk, it is embarrasing.  I really wish we would have splurged and gotten the higher priced one with the off-road wheels.  Will likely dump this one on Craig's List next year and get a better product.",2.0

"Very Poor quality product.  Nothing like the original ventage game.  DON'T buy this game!!!!  We had to put weights on one side to balance it so the kids could play with it.  After playing with it one time, they were frustrated that it was so much work to make the balance so they could even begin.",2.0
"cheap made and didn't balance correctly, no matter what we did to try to get it to work.  Funny little plastic ""beans"" were hard to handle and didn't seem to make much difference when you added them to the pot.  It might tump over after 1 bean or not tump over at all if they all were added.  Tried to play it once, doubt it ever leaves the box again unless the grand uses it for something else.",2.0
I does not start out standing straight up,2.0
"It's Fun! Maybe. It's Challenging! Sorta. It's exciting! No way. Its a waste of money! You betcha.

"As science and bug lovers, we were excited to receive this kit for our son's birthday, and thought it was such a great idea that we subsequently bought the same kit for several friends' birthdays. Sadly, we sent in our coupon/order for caterpillars on 4/23 and never had any response -- well past the 3-week wait time the kit stipulated. We sent an inquiry/complaint at about the 6-week mark, which was never responded to. We assumed the company went out of business and/or that it was just unreliable and gave up waiting (or ever buying the kit again, for anybody else.)

Without warning, the caterpillars arrived on our doorstep in mid-July, nearly 3 MONTHS (vs. weeks!) past our order and, unfortunately, coinciding with a 2-week vacation -- literally the worst possible time for the caterpillars to arrive, as our son would miss the entire experience. We wrote to the company again and, this time, got a prompt response and an offer to ship another round of caterpillars after our vacation -- prompting us to change our review rating from one-star to a two-star. To do better than that, though, we suggest that the company:

1. Change the ""warning"" about turn-around time from three weeks to three months
2. Put this on the outside of the packaging so people fully understand what they are buying
3. Implement a digital system that alerts customers: (a) when their caterpillar order has been received; (b) what the likely wait time is going to be; (c) when their order is on its way; (d) better yet, give some kind of delivery ""choice"" so buyers who won't be home to receive their order can adjust the timing (e.g. if the caterpillars had arrived during the two weeks our mail will be on hold, they'd be DOA.)
4. Answer customer service inquiries/complaints promptly (as they finally did with us, but not initially.)

Again, as science/nature lovers, we fully understand that  nature cannot be ""rushed."" Our issue is not with the caterpillars. We would've happily waited as long as it took for them to arrive at a time that we could take care of them. We just would've liked the company to manage our expectations appropriately and communicated with us to make this possible.",2.0
"I gave this to my 6 year old for her birthday in June and she is all excited to get the larvae and watch them grow into butterflies.  Unfortunately, I found out when I tried to order the larvae online that they will not ship to my state (Texas) because it's too hot.  Well it's hot here from May to October.  So now I have to wait until probably September before I can order them.  And I have to be the one to check back periodically to find out when they deem it not hot enough to ship.  Only in the fine print does their website say anything about temperatures being an issue.  If I had known this upfront, I wouldn't have given this to her for her birthday as she is going to be very disappointed.",2.0
"The item arrived right on time, but it wasn't clear to me that you have to order the caterpillars separately AND you have to pay an additional $5.00 AND pay postage to send in the form.  This might turn out to be really neat,educational, durable,we don't know yet- but it should show in big print that there's additional effort and cost required.  This stuff isn't easy to explain to an exicted 5 yr old",2.0
The scrabble board was titled collectors game. However it came with no pieces so I haven't played it yet. I will have to order them separately.,2.0
"Well made toy but the little yellow top piece just kind of sits down in the notches. I got another one from another website that the sorter plate slides in and out so when your child tries to put in a shape, it doesn't just pop right out of place like this one.",2.0
"I must say I was very disappointed to receive this product only to find that the larvae don't ship with the product!  If you go directly to the website insectlore.com you can buy gardens that ship with the larvae... so you get it all at once.  I'm disappointed we have to pay an additional $5 now to get the larvae, and it will take an extra 3-7 business days... UGH!  My daughter's birthday is in 3 days, guess we'll only be able to give her half of this present.  Very very very disappointed.  I wish I'd just gone directly to insectlore and bought from them.",2.0
"So cheaply made--- our kids had this game as toddlers and my 16 yr old has a desire to collect these games for when she has a family--- however, I doubt it will last--- even the BOX is flimsy!!!!",2.0
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  The game was missing one of the arms for the pot.  I need to return it, but more than 30 days have passed.  I am going to see if I can take it to a local store and exchange it.  Not happy about the piece missing.",2.0
Had to do a little shaving on the pieces on the bucket. there were excess plastic that needed to be shaved off so it would sit level.,2.0
"Not the fun game I remember as a kid.  The ""beans"" are plastic & the kettle is even cheaper plastic & tips really easily.  We can't get more than a few beans on top before it tips so it makes for some really short unchallenging games.  My 4 year old gets bored with it quickly.",2.0
It did not hold my children 2 and 4 for long at all.  They played with it for 2 minutes then got bored with the game.  The beans fall over the side very easy so they got frustrated.  It could be for older children but then it would be to childish.,2.0
"I bought this as a gift for my 6 yr old daughter and she was so excited to get started. Whatever price you get this for is too much... seriously. Its just a net and an order form to PURCHASE the butterfly larvae (you can also PURCHASE them online). Then you put the net back in the box and wait weeks for your larvae to arrive. By the time they do, your children will lose interest. Maybe this is something cool for a classroom or preschool but not as a gift! Its like buying an accessory for a toy without having the toy....  If you are going to buy this as a gift, I would suggest getting it WELL in advance so that you have enough time to purchase and wait for the larvae first before giving the whole package WITH EVERYTHING INCLUDED. After asking some friends who work in a preschool about this product, from what I now understand you are very lucky if even one of the butterflies stays alive until the time of release. My daughter and myself are not very enthused about this product at all.",2.0
"I mean, very young kids enjoy just throwing the beans around, but they're not into the game. Kids older than 4 immediately recognize this as a not-fun game. Really, no one likes it. I babysit many kids, and no one is a fan. Though one of my 3 year olds did enjoy just like tossing the beans on top for a while and making it fall for about 10 minutes.",2.0
Doesn't seem very well made,2.0
Too expensive and poorly made.  Was embarrassed as it was a gift.,2.0
Poorly made - wood pieces rub against each other so the board will not tilt in one direction - kind of defeats the purpose of the game.,2.0
"This is easily the cheapest labyrinth toy I've ever seen , visible glue everywhere, maze pieces are crooked.",2.0
"The good: The wood (with the exception of the pressboard bottom?) seems sturdy and the rounded edges were genius. I also loved that each shape would only fit in its specific hole. The colors are very bright.

The bad: I almost didn't buy this sorter based on another review about the lid being warped and not fitting correctly, but we own a lot of other Plan toys that are of great quality so I went ahead and bought it. Unfortunately, the one I received had a warped lid as well which means it doesn't fit properly.

The ugly: I attempted to contact Plan Toys before requesting a refund from Amazon, but never received a response. I don't know if this came from a bad batch or what, but I will likely look at other toy manufacturers in the future based on this experience.",2.0
"My almost 4 year old grandson tolerated his encounter with this game for two turns and then declared that it was boring.  He figured out pretty quickly that if you put one too many beans on the top of the pot, it will tip and the beans will fall.  He said ""this is boring""; we played ""Go Fish"" instead.  Wasn't worth the money or time invested to put the stickers on the game pieces, and to tell him how to play.  It was over in a flash.  He enjoyed ""Go Fish"" much more.",2.0
"I got this for my 15 month old son. It is a beautifully made toy; great quality and the educational value is definitely there. I only wish there was a way to keep the lid on. My son gets more enjoyment out of taking the lid off and filling the box with toys. I think if there was a latch or a hinge of some sort, he would be more apt to actually try and get the blocks through the holes. I would not buy this particular product again but I will buy from Plan toys in the future.",2.0
It's a great well-made box with fun blocks. I just wish there was a way to lock the lid in place. My kid keeps taking it off and at 12 months there is no shape sorting. She just takes the lid off and puts the blocks (and whatever else) in. This toy does not really service its original purpose for us.,2.0
"I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING THE WONDERFUL KIT WE HAD LAST YEAR BY THE SAME NAME. INSTEAD, I GOT A SMALLER HABITAT AND NO LARVAE - HAVE HAD TO SEND AWAY FOR '3-5 LARVAE' FOR AN ADDITIONAL $5 AND A LONG WAIT. LAST YEAR WE GOT 10 LARVAE INCLUDED.

Not as interesting as the full size version.,2.0
Way too small to actually play this game.  Go ahead and get regular size game. Or even the Extra Large mat for use at home.,2.0
"This is an ""OK"" item.  The quality of the pop up cage could be better, but customer service is bad.  It took a week for the larvae to arrive - and they were dead. There's a note on the container that says ""keep this end up"", and it was packed upside down in the box"".  I contacted customer service via email and was told that the larvae tend to be 'sluggish' after mailing - and I had to give them a week to recover.  A week later, they were still dead, and instead of offering to send a replacement shipment, they told me they were mailing me another coupon for more larvae...WTH? Would definitely not order this again - poor experience.",2.0
disappointed by the size - too big for travel,2.0
"My 4-year old loves it for about 2 minutes each day. It's not very ""fun"" until you can release the butterflies, since the container just sits there, but it's still a good learning experience.

However, I had an issue with the company from which you have to order the caterpillars. My voucher said it costs $3 for processing of the larvae, but I was charged $5. And then instead of the 5 larvae I was supposed to get, I got 2. How much fuss does one want to make over a $3/$5 charge? I have enough on my plate to waste time going back-and-forth with the company. My initial contact with them received a quick response asking for order clarification, and then I never heard from them again. It's not a lot of money so I'm not losing sleep over it, but I imagine how much extra they can make ripping off lots of people a dollar here, a dollar there, a caterpillar here, a caterpillar there. I don't think it's a good company, and I wouldn't do business with them again on principal alone.",2.0
"I thought this would be a great toy for our 3 year old grandson. As I
watched him trying to play with it, I was wishing I had gotten something else. If you want a push type toy, this isn't one for that. He's still into running and pushing bigger vehicles. This one isn't tall enough.
Then he tried moving the blade up and down and that proved to be rather
hard and doesn't move much when it does move. Later we took it to the
park so he could play in the sand with it. The rubber tracks kept
coming off. He finally got so frustrated with that, he went to play with
something else. I kept thinking about how much I had paid for this toy
that had turned into such a disappointing experience for him and myself.
If I had know about these things before I purchased it, I would have gone with something else.",2.0
"The CATERPILLARS are NOT included and you have to pay $5.oo to get them shipped. What a joke.

Still waiting for the Caterpillars!",2.0
"I don't know how much this product will bring my family latter, but I am really unhappy about extra $5.00 to pay, plus fill out the card with personal info and credit card info. I rather pay everything up front via Amazon, then just mail a postcard to request the live caterpillar.
Not a good gift idea. It will be bad that give it as a gift. The gift receiver will have to pay extra $5.00, or they don't want to pay & give out their personal info, then you wasted what you payed.",2.0

"Cons:
*unless you pick the dozer up to turn it, the tracks fall off
*lots of plastic parts
*wear parts are plastic, not metal

Pros:
*my son is required to fix this toy when the tracks come off, which provides some educational value
*bought locally for <$14, which seems like a fair price for this toy
*no pinched fingers, unlike some of the original all-metal designs

Bottom line:
Don't expect the same construction of the classic all-steel Tonkas.",2.0
"This was a dissapointing gift for a child.

When you receive the kit you have to mail in a postcard (or go online) and pay $3.00 to order the larve.  But the it takes up to 3 weeks to receive them in the mail.

The box contains the screen habitat and an instruction booklet.  That's it.",2.0
"It takes them forever to ship the larva to the east coast (there on the west), I actually called thinking it was lost and they sent out a new one, which also took several weeks to arrive. (I ended up with 2) By the time the larva arrives the caterpillar have formed into crystals. so you are missing out on a major part of the process. (I couldn't believe that a company which time is of the essence shouldn't take this in consideration)

This company has a great product in theory, but is extremely under efficient in their distribution and shipping methods. If they could upgrade that you have a phenomenal product.

"Santa got this for my six year old niece. She is really good with math and numbers, but just never wants to learn words and reading.

The dice are just not practical. They could take any form and they would have been just as good. The part that takes the longest is looking around each dice to find the letter you want. And, depending on how you play, the player can find themselves trapped. When you need one letter, it takes all six out of the game, so you can end up needing a letter that is on a die that is already being used.

This is just not fun, helpful, or educational.",2.0
"I like the regular Boggle, this one just seems to be a waste of money when you can make the regular version adaptable to a younger child.  My 5 year old did not find it as a game, he was extremely bored with it.  Also, I can do this with a set of flash cars and letters.",2.0
It just wasn't what I expected.  I thought it'd be great so the marbles wouldn't get lost everywhere but it just isn't as fun as the big version.,2.0

It does say 4 and up, but i am well over 4 and i couldn't get the toy to work. waste of money, get the real one.",2.0
The game is ok.  It was for young children.  Said age 5 and up but younger children can play with the family.,2.0

I love my red wagon.  We use it to haul in wood for the fireplace in winter and many uses for it during the rest of the year.  Its the 2nd one I have gotten.  The first one was so old the wheels finally rotted off.  Hope this one lasts as long,2.0
Kids didn't play with as much as I thought they would,2.0

the clown is not synchronized with the music.  his head pops up at random moments.  there is a 2 or 3 crank pause at the end of the song.  a jack-in-the-box should POP when expected.,2.0
I thought this was a game for 2 players but there is only one card/letter cube holder.  I guess we can play by just setting the letter cubes on the card.  My kids are good at taking turns and sharing but it would be nice if they could play at the same time.  Especially since they are preschoolers.  Also seems expensive for what it is at $13.  Disappointing for sure. We have not played yet- but at first glance- it was not what I expected at all.,2.0

"This is a toy we have wanted for a very long time.  Last Christmas we finally got it.  Then, we played it for the first time.  We noticed the board was small, no jail, very little money.

You' ll be sorry if you buy the j.r. edition",2.0
"i bought this so i would get a modern version of the Jack in the Box we all grew up with, but the old fashion one is better, this however is made of safer plastic, no sharp edges or metal!",2.0
"I was excited to find this toy because it uses the winding motion of a jack-in-the-box but is sized for little fingers.  LIke all the Tolo toys we have, it is bright and colorful, but we seem to have gotten a defective unit.  The little man pops up in the middle of the song (""This Old Man"") instead of at the end.  Frustrating.  I notice also that our 2yo has trouble pushing the little man back down--he won't stay.  I can do it, but it takes a delicate touch, something toddlers do NOT have.  In addition, the squeaky button on the side is hard for little hands to push, and even in big hands it sometimes squeaks, sometimes not.  If it worked right it might be good, but as it is we are disappointed, and can't recommend it.",2.0
"Not really a true game. It's just lettered blocks and some cards. The instructions just said here are some ""suggested"" ways to play, make up your own version.",2.0
Great game for ore schooler,2.0
It was not challenging. Maybe for young kids. My grown daughter and I played two games and it went on the donate pile.,2.0
This game was not what I expected. It's a great learning tool for this age group but is not a game the family can play together. The child basically uses the alphabet dice to remake the word on a card.,2.0
The toy is much smaller than I thought and most importantly doesn't pop up very well. Wish we would have been more careful open the package as I would have returned it!,2.0
Difficult for kids to turn the handle. Not the best Jack in the box that I have seen. Would not recommend for other to buy,2.0
"My mom bought this toy foor my son for Christmas last year (2010).  My son is just about 2 1/2 now.  I wanted a jack in the box so that my son could work on his motor skills and oppositional skills.  He loves being surprised too.  For the 11 months that we have owned this toy my son still can't crank the handel.  I myself find it kind of awkward to do so.  The toy is cute and hasn't broken (yet).  The star on the front turns and clicks.  My 4 month old loves when I turn it.  The button for the squeaker on the back is kind of hard to push (for me).  My two year old hasn't tried playing with the button because it's so hard to push (he has other toys that squeak when you push them and he can do it just well).

So, in conclusion, because the toy is so awkward and hard (for a child) to manipulate our toy has been not much more than space taking up my kids' toy box.",2.0
"Altho I love the looks of this toy (bright colors) it isn't very engaging.  For one, it takes too long to wind the toy to where the clown pops up.  I think it's a cute addition to my grandson's toy box, but as far as entertaining him...it doesn't.",2.0

"Poor quality, very flimsy construction.  When you use the wagon handle to pull, it feels like it will bend at any moment.",2.0
"I bought this for my four-year-old niece, and it wasn't what I thought it would be. It wasn't what her mom, my sis-in-law, thought it would be either. My niece is learning to read, so my sister though this would be a good game and she would not realize she was learning in the process. Well, it was painful for all of us. My niece wasn't reading...she was looking at the pictures. So, we covered up the pictures and had her sound out the words. The part where she has to spell the words is helpful as she learns to read; however, I would switch it up so that the pictures are not revealed until they read the words...then they can use the dice to spell the words. My niece got frustrated and we are disappointed in the game's design.",2.0
". . .but I just can't get excited by this game.
I learned how to play ""Monopoly"" at the age of 5.  My eldest son learned how to play at 8.  My kids enjoy the real game.  They don't enjoy the ""kids"" version.
Kids are brighter than most adults give them credit for.  The original game is a wonderful teaching tool on a number of levels.  I don't see the point in ""dumbing down"" when it is not necessary.
Parents, teach your children how to play the REAL GAME.  Then, there can be some valuable family time.  The adults will too quickly get bored with this version -- and frankly, so will the kids.
Don't waste your time or money.",2.0
The printing on the game board doesn't line up properly. and the cards seem to be two different sizes from two different decks. Friends complain so much we don't even play it much.,2.0
This is a cheaply made inferior product compared to those of 30 years ago.  The metal is way lighter gauge and they do not use any bearing in the steering assembly.  I think it is overpriced for a cheaply made throw away product.  I would not recommend or buy this wagon.,2.0
Comes apart very easy,2.0
"Not only did I expect the large cans, these cans were the mini ones and half of the cans in this set were rubbery and unable to be played with. It isn't worth paying $3.99 to return them so I feel like I got ripped off! I don't believe it is the fault of the manufacturer, but the warehouse it came from probably had it sitting on the shelf for years. It's a better bet to buy something like this from a local store where you don't have to pay to return it.",2.0
"If you want to spend the money on something you can use a few times, then it is ok.
After opening each box, you have about two days before it dries out and gets hard.
I always keep the lid on but still dried.
I opened one color at a time (one in a week or so) but decided to make my own :)",2.0
I should have listened to other reviewers.  This is nothing more than a set of colorful flashcards.  Don't waste money on this game.,2.0
"This is nice play-doh but the containers were much smaller than I expected. For the amount you get, the price is way too high.",2.0
"What an utterly boring game.  We love to play games, including educational games, but Boggle Jr. was a huge dud with my 3 and 5 year old kids.  Really, this is just flashcards with letter dice (and the dice don't even get rolled).  There's no game or strategy...just letter matching.  This one went to Goodwill after a few plays.",2.0
"This is a nice idea for helping children to become more familiar with the alphabet and words and spelling, but there is one huge drawback. The game uses only capital letters. Children are not typically going to see EGG written, but egg. They won't see NEST, but nest. My older two children (when 4  and 2 ) used to try to match up the dice with the cards on their own (no rolling, just turning the dice to find the letters), and thought it was fun. But, it didn't translate to them recognizing the words in other contexts.  It couldn't, because the game uses all uppercase letters, whereas in real-life lowercase is used.

It also is often difficult to get the letters you need to finish the word, since there are a limited number of dice with lots of letters. You can spend a lot of time just rolling and rolling and rolling, waiting for the right letter to come out. That's frustrating for little children.

Considering the capital letter drawback, the gameplay issue, and that the game is basically heavy-duty cardboard flashcards with several dice, I would pass on this game.",2.0
"This is pretty much kid vs kid only.  Adults cannot play along.  You can make it into a solo game for one child, but its really more like flash cards for spelling if you do that.

The product is basically a set of flash cards for spelling, with some letter cubes for the kids to spell out the words.  The rules propose two games, which are basically see if the kids spells the word right, they get to keep the card if they do, first kid with 5 cards wins.  Adults can pretend to play along if the child is younger and will ""fall for it.""  It really works as a game only if there are two kids the same age playing.

I don't know, but I can't see my daughter pulling this out when a friend comes over.  Therefore, to the extent this is a set of flash cards for spelling, its kind of expensive for what it is.

Don't get me wrong, you can definitely make it into a learning tool.  Your call.",2.0
"This game was not engaging.  My son did not find it interesting.  He has not asked to play with it again.  You push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself.

If you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance, try What's GNU.  It is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults.",2.0
"I have this wagon hidden in the garage for Christmas and my 3 year old asked me whats making the garage reek.  The wheels emit a very strong chemical smell.  We cannot bring it or any of the shipping materials inside because it's offgassing so bad; hence, we are considering trashing this wagon as not only is it a health concern, but just plain annoying to stink up the place.",2.0

"I decided to skip a trip to Target or Kmart and just order a bunch of playdough online. It was disappointing to see that nearly half of the colors were already nearly dried when the package arrived. What's worse, try explaining this to an excited then confused three year old. This is my first time buying from this supplier. I'm hoping it was just a fluke. In their defense, I didn't send them a formal complaint since I didn't know how to do this via Amazon. I could only find the ""return"" option and within days, the entire ten color kit was useless. It was tossed, not worth going through the trouble of returning.",2.0
"This is very poorly made. The bottom piece and all the shape pieces are cheap foam, and the plastic pegs don't stay in the holes very well.

The pegs do not stay in the foam base and are a little challenging for him to get back in on his own.  Any time he tries to pull the pieces off, the whole peg comes out of the base.  Okay toy with adult assistance, but definately not what I expectd.  Great idea, but not well thought out.",2.0

"This is not a review of the wagon per se. My mom ordered this for her granddaughter/my daughter for Christmas. When I opened the box to put it together, the wagon body was completely banged up.  The cardboard box was fine, so it seems like they packed a damaged wagon.

Luckily, you can get warranty replacement parts pretty easily by filling out a form on Radio Flyer's website. But when the replacement finally arrived, they'd sent the wrong body. Now I'm waiting on the third try to just get me the right product.

Suffice it to say, not been impressed by the experience so far.",2.0
"This toy was kinda a disappointment for me. I'm in college and was looking for the cheapest hopp to put on my door just to shoot at.

Ball is UV colored so thats kinda cool, but not worth it save your money!",2.0
"6 months ago, I bought this wagon to use when my nephew comes over. For the first few months, the wheels off gassed and stank like hell, but it calmed down about 3 months ago and doesn't stink all the time. However, every time I bring the wagon outside and back in, the wheels stink all over again. There is no way this is safe for a young child.

In addition, the wheels are wobbly and the steering mechanism is rickety, despite being assembled by an ASA Certified mechanic.

Think twice before buying. This is not the wagon you remember from your childhood!!!!!!!!!",2.0
"This is hard to rate.  It is certainly, by viture of its speed, better than the physical board game.  Ufortunatly the weakness of its dictionary is so bad that is is hardly worth having.  The dictionary is limited in absolute terms but more disturbingly, it seems to carry an aswful ethnic/cultural bias.  As the ommisions to the included dictionary can certainly not be laid at the foot of the dictinary they claim to use, the ommsions of things like tao, odin, leo, etc, seem to indicate a degree of editing that goes far beyond censoring naughty words.  I won't even go into the odd selection of worlds of foreing origen that are accepted vs those that aren't or proper names etc.
  As a parent, this is one of the few games that I have had to spend more time explainging to the kids that they are smarter than the writers than any other.
  As bas as this is, the worst part comes when you try to exit and the game insists upon showing you game credits before returning comtrole of your computer to you.  When I first whent to shut this game down, ( disgusted that it didn't recognized tao, a religion held by hundereds of millions of people, as a word)  the computer then becgan to show a list of credits I could not figure out how to turn off.

If you feel you must get this take a serious look at the onyx version for fifty bucks.  <-- if you wait for the right borders or bn coupon you can knock it down another twenty five percent.",2.0
"I enjoyed this new deluxe board because of its ability to rotate. However, I took it to a friend's house and left it in the car for about 2 hours the result was not pretty. The cheap overlay that forms the surface that you play on melted and warped. Despite attempts to reshape it I had to trash the whole set. For fifty dollars I think the manufacter could have made a product that stood up to 80 degree day.",2.0
"Scrabble is a terrific game-I am a college professor, and bought this version of the game to entertain some other professors at my house one evening. I love the turntable, but was very, very disappointed to find that the board itself is made of paper-not plastic like ones I have seen. Well, this board won't last very long. All someone has to do is spill a drink on the board, and it's bye-bye $30.00! Be sure that you store this game in a cool, dry place.
If you expect that this Scrabble version won't last very long, you won't be disappointed.",2.0
"I bought this game after my wife and I started playing Scrabble frequently. I thought that the rotating board would be more convenient than using our lazy susan. I also thought the raised grid would be great for keeping the tiles in place. However, for the price I paid, I expected much better quality. Upon opening the box, I immediately commented how cheap the plastic was. As I set the board down, the playing surface was very thin and wasn't really attached completely to the base. It was very thin cardboard and moved up and down when you touched it. On the box, it appears that the tile holders have the information about the number of letter tiles molded into them. But, they are just stickers. I packed it all up and returned it the same day. If I had paid a lot less, I would've kept it. But, it was just too poor quality for what I paid.",2.0
"The bad part is that there were 6-10 little dents in the body, obviously there before it was painted.  Looked like it was hammered with a flat end screwdriver.  Very poor quality control.  One of the wheels wobbles, but maybe they're all like that???  My 16 month old grandson still likes it.  Too much trouble to take apart and return.",2.0
"My daughter had to have this for her 4th b.d.  It falls apart, for instance the wings won't stay on and the door won't stay closed.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this.  I can't believe a toy that cost that much made by Mattel could be such a hunk of junk.",2.0
"I bought this for my 4 year old.  She had never seen it, but I thought she would love it as she loves anything with Barbie on it.  I did buy it second hand. Thank goodness.  She played with it a few times before it landed in her closest.  She has not once asked to play with it and it has been 6 months at least.  The wings fall off and the seatbelts don't work all that great. The little pieces rest somewhere in her room.  Maybe for an older girl who can act out scene's with their Barbies.",2.0
"I have been shopping around for the deluxe version of Scrabble for some weeks now (finally purchased but decided to see if I paid too much by checking amazon.com).  For some reason, amazon.com is overcharging for this item--about $25 overpriced to be specific.  You can find this same version at Barnes & Noble for $35 and at Toy R Us for $33 (as of 12/2007).  An additional caveat: all the people who post complaints at the various sites about the shoddiness of this version, when compared to the older deluxe version, are unfortunately quite correct in complaining--very poor materials.  It *feels* cheap.  The original Scrabble base edition I remember so fondly from my distant childhood was of higher quality than this disappointing modern edition.  My advice would be to buy the basic version (from a store that doesn't overcharge so outrageously) and place it on a large lazy susan situated on your game table.",2.0
"This is the most poorly design toy I have ever seen. I called Mattel and they picked it up and refunded the money back to me. Our daughter couldn't even play with it. The seats didn't stay on, the doors wouldn't stay closed, and the tail kept falling off. It's horrendous....",2.0
"If you are buying this because your parents/grandparents/etc. have the deluxe edition and you want one too, be warned, this is nowhere close to as ""deluxe"" as their version.  The board is flimsy, the racks are plastic, the turntable is fragile, it's barely better than the standard game board.  Look elsewhere for a slightly used version from the 90s.  You'll be glad you did.",2.0
scrabble the game is great.  the deluxe version for approximately [...] feels cheap.  it has a very thin plastic and carboard board with plastic tile holders.  i was expecting something that felt more solid.,2.0
I bought this to replace a game we have.  The houses and hotels are plastic and just overall cheap.  The deluxe edition was what I was replacing.  Ordering that one soon :),2.0
"Everyone knows Scrabble, so I'll review the quality of this product rather than the game itself.

Everything about this is flimsy, the plastic base is pretty weak, not that this game is designed to take a beating. The cardboard board with its raised edges is also pretty poor.

If you want a better quality version of this, look on ebay for an older version made from bakelite, it will probably cost the same anyway.

For all it's faults, it is just Scrabble and as I said, not designed to take a beating. I won't be rushing out to buy a better quality one from ebay, but one day, I will definitely do so.",2.0
"When I ordered this game, I saw that the box was advertised as Deluxe turntable Scrabble. When my grandchildren came to visit, I told them to set the game up while I finished what I was doing. I was so disappointed when I saw that it was not like my daughters Deluxe Scrabble game. The game board is flimsy. The board had a covering on it without the plastic covering like the one she has. The good board has a plastic covering over the board so the letter pieces are held place in much better. With this board, everytime you put a letter down,you have to be careful not to knock other pieces off. I called and was told  I could return it which I did.",2.0
"Monopoly is a money game of exploitation and eradicating all competition.  Each player represents an investor with an initial amount of money and a playing token.

The playing board is played on a hard mapboard. The mapboard is hard paper stock that is the same as what one would find with a Risk or Axis & Allies playboard.  The play is on a square ring broken down of ten smaller movement squares per side.  Each movement square is either a special event or a real estate square of a certain real estate values.  (Hidden secret: The real estate squares are named after streets and railways of Atlantic City, NJ, of around 1934).  There are several special event squares per boardside.

The money is play paper money in denominations similar to U.S. Currency up to $500 bills. The player tokens are usually the same color but are different figurines.  (The playing tokens are small and could be a choking hazard to little people).  Actually anything can be used as a player token, a personal favorite is the M4 Sherman from Axis&Allies Europe, but perhaps the Soviet T-34 would make a better statement.  There are two decks of special cards for random events and a set of dice for token movement and more random chance results.  There are also little green houses and big red hotels for upgrading one's real estate.

The game is played in turns, and once the initial player is established play usually goes in clockwise order.  During game-play it is a dice-fest, and luck plays a big part of a players development.  The dice roll can be a serious choking hazard game-wise if one has poor dice rolling luck.  The starting point is called ""GO,"" and it also serves as a replenishment space.  Go gives the player $200 just for going past the space, as if the investor has kept their day job and is still earning a salary.  Chance and Community Chest spaces are random event spaces where upon landing on such the player must take a card and do as the card instructs.  The play spaces are replete with peril.  There are several bad places to land: one space sends the player to jail, two tax spaces to cost the player some money.  Landing on someone else's property means you owe that person some amount of rent unless that property in in mortgage.  There is one nothing space called ""Free Parking,"" although many people's house rules play this space as a ""win all the money from all fines and taxes"" space.  It is advisable to define this house rule before game-play begins to avoid game generated hostilities.

An initial goal is to grab as many unowned properties as one can afford.  Control of as many spaces as possible is very important, and the goal is to put a block of similar properties together.  Once a color block of properties is achieved then the owner can start building upgrades in the form of houses and hotels.  This causes the landing cost to the other players to increase to the point that they may not be capable of financially surviving the unavoidable landing on one's property of debt.

On the plus side of this game is that is has been around for a very long time, it got banned in some countries, and it has really cool little metal token pieces.  Another positive aspect of the game is that there are many people who are already familiar with the game rules, so the learning curve is minimal.  However, finding people willing to play is another matter.

On a down side to this game is the only way to win is to exploit the other players and drive the other investors out of business in a win-loose bourgeois financial fiasco. Troubled Asset Relief Program funds are not permitted in the rules, the only way to stave off bankruptcy is to sell off ones assets until the debts are paid, but since these assets are the only way to make money this is usually a sign of decline.

Once all other investors have been driven out of business then total monopoly has occurred and the sole survivor wins.  Even the basic game takes a while to play (and most optional rules just extend the game) and very few games ever get played out to the bitter end.",2.0
"Scrabble is my favorite game by far.  It is a game that is different every time.  It is challenging and highly entertaining.

Unfortunately, Hasbro has decided to go cheap in the quality department.  I have an older version of the deluxe game that is very high quality.  The newer version is poorly made.  It is flimsy and the tile slots are shallow.

Anyone who ever played on one of the original flat boards knows what a huge improvement the recessed tile slots were in the original deluxe game.  Now they are not nearly as deep so the tiles are not well secured and the board is about as stable as cardboard.

One hopes that the manufacturers will go back to making high quality boards for this outstanding game.",2.0
"It's embarassing that the flagship Scrabble product in the US has been cheapened so much.

Pros:

* turntable feels better than ever

* tiles & racks are decent

Cons:

* board is paper-textured grid prone to getting dirty (permanently)

* printing on board is dull and difficult to read in lower light conditions

* tiles do not stay put

* board surface feels flimsy and cheap

I've owned a Selchow & Righter deluxe board for over 25 years, and it is nearly in mint condition after more than 1000 games played.  With it's brightly printed and easy to read special squares sealed beneath the hard plastic grid which firmly anchors the tiles in place, it simply puts the latest cheap product from MB to shame (which I've used at my local Scrabble club).

If at all possible, pick up an old turntable edition at a garage sale -- you'll be happier, it will last far longer, and it will cost less.  And if you play frequently, buy a set of Protiles (or some similar after market tile set).",2.0
"So, you want to buy Scrabble, huh?  You were playing at your Grandmas, and you saw she had this cool version with a rotating turntable, wooden tile holders, nice deep pockets where the letters sit on the board.  You decided to buy one yourself here at amazon. You ordered it, excited to have a high quality Scrabble in your own possession. You get it in the mail, you open the box, thrilled to own Scrabble, but then.... the unthinkable!!  This ain't your Grandma's Scrabble!!  What they have done, is turn a nice idea into the cheapest thing they could come up with and still call it ""deluxe Scrabble"". PLASTIC. Everything is PLASTIC.  The tiles might be wood, I dunno I didn't bite them, but everything else is cheap, thin plastic.  Doesn't turn nice like the old version. And the biggest kicker of them all, is the board itself. Gone are the nice deep squares the tiles would sit in - where even if you bumped into the game or table, they would stay put.  Now it's shallow grooves, and you have to be careful not to turn the board to quicky or they'll move easy.

You're better off buying an old one at a garage sale.",2.0
"This is a horrible, shoddy construction for something that used to be done so well.  The grooves that are intended to hold the tiles in place as the whiz around on the lazy susan aren't tall enough to hold the tiles in place on even a gentle spin, thereby rendering the whole thing pointless.  I can't imagine why they would have changed the construction of the board besides saving a few pennies.  Clearly they never tested it on actual people before putting it in stores.",2.0
"I read the reviews and decided to try it anyway.  The grids do not hold the letters.  They slide around just like on the regular folding board.  I love this game, but the board is horrible for the price.  I promptly returned it.  Will hold out for a better turntable board.",2.0
"I was disappointed in the Deluxe Edition set as the tiles do not stay secure inside the grooves and it isn't as well made as others on which I have played.  In other words it doesn't look ""deluxe"".  I have other Scrabble sets from many, many years ago, but I wanted this edition for the turntable and separated grooves.",2.0
"As a big fan of Scrabble, I anxiously purchased the Deluxe edition for Christmas for my 10 and 13 year old, remembering the days of playing the old Deluxe version with my Mom.  My anticipation and excitement was quickly replaced by surprise and disapointment at the cheap and flimsy board that I found in the box.  What happened?!?!?!?!?  (...)I don't feel they put $10 worth of work into this thing.  While still nicer that the standard version, it defintely comes short of the old version with the plastic board that keeps peices in place; this one is a cheap imitation with a thin cardboard playing board with tiny ridges that is not even attached to the playing surface - there are actually waves in the board!!  Very disappointing effort all around.",2.0
"Monopoly is somewhat educational as far as the business world goes--but ultimately it's a a piggy, greedy Republican game.  Don't play it a lot.  You'll raise unpleasant kids.  [And no, I'm not a Democrat.]  Can't American toy makers come up with something more creative than the 1000th version of Monopoly?",2.0
"This Monopoly set was cheaply produced in China, as you might guess given its price. For a family looking for a first set, it seems satisfactory. But anyone who has played Monopoly for years should be on notice that this set, redesigned in 2008, includes several minor annoyances.

First, the most practical annoyance. The board folds up into quarters, which allows the manufacturer to fit the set into a smaller box, presumably to reduce production costs. But because the box is somewhat smaller (about 16 inches long), there is no room for the sort of convenient tray for Monopoly money that was once standard in the old boxes (which were about 20 inches long). This is annoying for both gameplay and storage.

Second, the producers have unnecessarily and inexplicably made small changes to the rules of the game -- rules that have stood for more than half a century. Landing on the Luxury Tax space used to cost you $75; now it costs $100. The new rules also change the numbers of each kind of bill to be apportioned to players at the start of the game -- and in fact, the game comes with a smaller supply of some bills.

Mention of this set's Monopoly money brings us to the third annoyance: the manufacturers made numerous gratuitous changes to the look of the game. The palette of colors used for Monopoly bills in the United States since the 1940s has been changed: The $10 bill used to be yellow; now it's blue. The $50 bill used to be blue; now it's purple. (These changes make it hard to reuse money from older Monopoly sets.) Among the other unnecessary changes to the look of the game: The formerly purple properties on the board (Mediterranean Avenue and Baltic Avenue) have been recolored brown. The Community Chest and Chance cards are now printed on white cardstock instead of the familiar orange and yellow, and the classic drawings on those cards have been replaced with computer-generated 3D cartoons. Even the ""Go"" space has been redesigned: now the word ""Go"" is written in black instead of the familiar red. (Stodgy purists might also be put off by the various alterations to font, logo, and other design elements.)

To be sure, these changes do not alter the fundamentals of the game itself. But they are annoying enough that anyone with nostalgic memories of the game from childhood should consider a different set.

"[...]

Milton Bradley and Hasbro are out to reduce the quality of their product, just to make a fast nickel.  The modern set is too flimsy for durability. The board is a one piece molded grid that BARELY holds the tiles in place. No acrylic grid over a paper board. The design is screened onto the surface.

If Winning Games decides to make a turntable edition of SUPER Scrabble, will they make the board just as cheap?  Who knows?  I hope not.

For example, if the word is ""fox"" and you guess an ""O"" the game would place that letter first. Then if you guessed ""F"" next, it would say OF_. You then had to figure out what the last letter was AND unscramble the word. I purchased another Hangman product I liked much better.",2.0

The game board is not one of the better layouts I have seen. Card arrangement leaves players hunting for their card on the board and often places the duplicate card in very close proximity. Blue and Green game chips are both very dark. Not the easiest to differentiate in certain lighting conditions or if anyone is slightly color blind. Need better contrast between colors. Red chips are too few in number to be used as alternate color.,2.0

However, buying this game over the internet or even in a store could turn out to be a major hassle for you. We had a game for a long time, but Daddy began to wake up after every single push of the button. I went and bought a new game at Toys R Us and, with that one, the button wasn't catching, so Daddy would never wake up. I took it back and exchanged it, and the same thing happened with this third game. The manufacturing of the spring inside Daddy or the ""catching"" mechanism is very faulty.

The rules are a bit vague on several things, and there was never a true sense of ""Uh-Oh, how are we going to over come this?"" that make good co-op games so much fun to play. Unless you really aren't trying, it seems impossible to lose.

Also, the paper tokens feel like they'll tear at any moment, and the game board and cards are poorly printed. There is a small card in the game that explains that the company uses recyclable materials, but that shouldn't be an excuse to make the game feel cheap.

"The ""Blocks and Marbles"" set is a much higher quality than these Amaze-n Marbles.  These have huge variations in the quality of wood pieces; some are really porous lightweight woods that are rough around the edges (not splintery, just porous and rough, think dried up sponge).  The blocks with the holes are really rough inside.  The tracks are fine, a denser smoother wood, though the wood stains are a bit muddy.  The ""Blocks and Marbles"" sets have tight grain wood with clean cuts and smoothly sanded holes.  These don't have as satisfying a clatter when the towers and tracks fall, or as nice a feel in hand.  Also, the box has a sticker that says ""assembled in the USA, some parts may have been made in China.""  Returned these and got two sets of the others instead.  The shapes are generally the same and both brands are compatible with each other.

Oh yes, that's the other thing with both of these -- you need to use support blocks between the tracks so that the marbles can go through.  So get the biggest set you can afford (or multiple sets).",2.0

Two-eyed jacks are wild and the one-eyed jacks allow you to remove one of your opponent's tokens (that's the small bit of interaction).  The jacks are the only thing that gives players any kind of control over the game and they are only 8 out of 104 cards.  So really, it's just Bingo where the team with the luckiest draws wins.",2.0

Our other marble run has been used countless times and is so much fun.",2.0
Hard for my 5 year old to play with. You have to line the holes up just right. I think we would have preferred a plastic version.,2.0
"the board is small
and some of the colors is less",2.0
I guess toddlers might like the challenge of putting the fruit pieces in the holes. But otherwise this game consists of a spinner and thats about it. It lacks the narrative bit that Chutes and Ladders has (which is only marginally more fun). Its about as much fun as just spinning a spinner.,2.0
"These sets used to be great - way back when someone gave a crap about their product - but the wood is not well finished and the drill holes are rough, so the marbles don't actually pass smoothly through.

I was very disappointed.",2.0
Just cardboard game it broke within an hour after opening it up,2.0
This came with 8 blueberries and needs 10. All other colors have 11,2.0
"In theory, this is a great toy and reminds me of the one I had as a child. However, I purchased it for 2 different kids and found the same issue.
The string to drag it around is pretty short, and the cord which attaches the part you hold up to the base is only 2-3 inches, which means the kiddos have to actually hold the base up to their ears to pretend to use the phone. Poor design. I wouldn't buy another and ended up actually cutting that cord",2.0
The holes for the marbles are not sanded enough for a smooth ride.  Difficult for my 6 year old to set up because of poor finishing work by company.  Smells like varnish even 4 months after purchase.,2.0
The cord is so short that it makes it impossible to play with.,2.0
This is a great toy for a older toddler but needs to be on solid ground. This toy could be improved by having connecting joints in someway. Otherwise it's way to easy to knock down every 5 mins.,2.0
"I avoided the metal slinky since they can actually stretch\bend and get ruined.
This unit is small, and it's not very slinky!
Good luck getting it to go down stairs - if you're lucky it might traverse a few paperbacks.
Wish I tried it before I buyed it ;)",2.0
"I really wanted to like this product. The concept is great.  However, there are two big problems. 1) the squares that have a hole in the top and spit the marble out horizontally are NOT well-crafted.  They are drilled very roughly and at an angle that doesn't always give the marble much speed as it spits out.  Many pieces in the set I ordered still had drill shavings in them. 2) because the blocks are all evenly-sized, horizontal marble trails are level--meaning unless a marble has enough momentum, it's not going to get from one end to the other.  Without any downward slope, you're getting no assist from gravity to keep the marble moving.  I've gotten around this by adding little shims to boost up one end slightly, so that marbles will roll successfully.  Kind of a ""hack"" solution.

So again it's a cool idea and could be a fun toy, but instead expect a lot of frustration.",2.0
"I got this for my 18 month old - I remember loving it as a kid.  Yes, the cord connecting the handset to the phone is short and even she has a hard time ""listening"" without lifting up the phone.  And why shorten that cord when the pulling cord is long enough to use effectively?  The worst part about this phone is that it doesn't have the rotary dial feel that I was looking for. It just goes around and around making ringing sounds.  If you want the rotary feel (you know, where you spin it and it comes back to where you started?) then get the classic/retro version.",2.0
"bought to stop squirrels from climbing feeder, apparently my squirrels are smarter than some. not holding up very well.",2.0
Somewhat disappointing; it does not proceed down any normal stairs as one might have expected...,2.0
I didn't expect a used toy & it was dirty I've tried by best to clean it with bleach the stains still didn't come out.,2.0
"We were so excited about this toy. It is made of excellent quality materials, but it really didn't perform as well as expected. We used shims and improved its performance some, otherwise, the marbles didn't roll well at all. I really wouldn't recommend this toy as it is now.",2.0
"The game is okay, but so simple, outdated and lacking in originality that my family was bored with it before finishing the first game and I doubt we'll every play it again.  Back in the day when you had chess, checkers, Monopoly and a deck of cards this probably seemed interesting, but in the age of Settlers of Cataan, Carcasone, Dominion, Castle Panic, Cards Against Humanity and a hundred other innovative, exciting games--this one just doesn't stack up.

Might be fun to play with a grandparent who likes games, but isn't so good at trying new things.",2.0
"The holes don't align perfectly.  Also, it is difficult when you're building to see where the hole should be.  A plastic marble run would have been a better choice for us.  The children wanted a faster building pace with the marbles.",2.0
This thing is Tiny!  I was expecting a typical size slinky but made of plastic.  Was disappointed when it arrived and its half the size.,2.0
Super cheap quality.,2.0
Product didn't hold up to a 2  and 3 year old playing with it more than once. Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this. Delivery and order went great. Just wasn't for us.,2.0
Not a good buy.  Too small to work well.  Will go down steps as original slinky would.,2.0
Disappointed how cheap this game was made.  Sad.  :(,2.0
I just opened this game and it says it should contain 4 colors and 10 of each color however we didn't get any of the orange.  Unfortunately I bought this when it was on sale before my child was old enough to play so I can't return it now.  Suggest you open it right away and make sure all the pieces are there.  Kind of disappointing that 4 of us can't play...Aside from that love the concept of the game.,2.0
Broke in a couple of months.,2.0
"too small, hasn't worked on any of the stairs I have tried it on",2.0
Is really too small to do much with.  You will not find stairs small enough for this to work on.  Is bent rather easily as well.,2.0
This brand new game was missing Yellow pieces for Orange. I have a disappointed 3 year old that wants to play with the one color that isn't there.,2.0
Slinky was perfect at first but when I tried to play with it again it got twisted and broke so disappointed ,2.0
"my steps are to wide so the slinky dose not work, its not the product fault",2.0
Smaller and way flimsier than expected.,2.0
"The string that attaches the phone to the base is incredibly short so it makes it pretty much impossible for my son to hold up to his face.  Only good for pulling around which is disappointing as we bought it because he loves to ""answer"" the phone.",2.0
"There are numerous pieces that are very small - there is a warning on the box, so I did not do my due diligence. With baby siblings around I ended up throwing it in the garbage to avoid risk",2.0
"I kept on messing with the toy thinking there must be something else to it- but it's just a bat, ball and stand.  My 11 month old son likes hitting the ball (and has for a couple months) but he likes hitting anything with a bat.  Not much to it, wouldn't recommend with so many other choices out there.",2.0
Very short cord from phone to receiver. I replaced the cord with a longer piece of para cord  works great now.,2.0
"It's a slinky for sure, but if you're looking for the big 'classic' slinkies this is not it.  It is not heavy and feels relatively cheap compared to the old ones.  Not unexpected, and perhaps great for kids who will like the lighter version, but not something that feels like it will last.",2.0
"This is not the Slinky of my youth. That was a heavy metal object that I had for years.

I purchased this for my 7 year old son. It kinked and bent badly the first time he used it. The metal is thin and this is not as large as I remember the original. Right now, I have a couple heavy books on top of this trying to salvage it, but I think it's lost cause.",2.0
"This Slinky is noticeably smaller and lighter weight than the Slinkys I remember from my own childhood in the 60s - 70s. I would guess it's about 1/3 smaller.  The difference in dimensions affects how well it performs its various Slinky tricks. In addition, each of the end pieces of the coil have a rather rough metal ""tab"" that is a bit rough on little kid hands. It is NOT an original Slinky and to advertise it as such is misleading.",2.0
While this slinky claims to be the original it certainly doesn't perform like the one I had as a youngling. Its metal and holds up well enough but it simply will not walk down the stairs. This is the whole reason I purchased this. Lame,2.0
"Although this says ""Original Metal Slinky"", this is small in diameter,
does not ""walk"" down stairs, or on small stair stepped items. Kids did have fun pulling on them and such for which they are not made.
If you want the real slinky that you remember as a kid, this is not it.",2.0
Not really long enough to be much fun.  Poor material.  Destroyed by 3-4 yr-olds within 2 hours.,2.0
I didn't realize they just send you a colot at random. I expected pictured color.,2.0
"The cord is so short that my 18 month old grand daughter got bored with it right away.  The phone receiver can be picked up but that cord is also short, of course that is probably a safety feature.  Altogether though she is not terribly impressed and the phone stays in the toy box.  Sorry.",2.0
"The string connecting the red telephone piece to the phone itself is like 5 inches long, and any child has to either hold the whole phone to their ear or lean down to it to ""answer"" it. Its cute and sturdy, though ineffective in its soul purpose.",2.0
The cord is too short,2.0
"Not as fun as I'd hoped, & there are a million little pieces to keep track of.  My little girls enjoy it, but want to get it out on their own & then pieces get lost.",2.0
The game I received was missing the oranges. Can still play but would've been nice to have a full set.,2.0
We purchased this because it was recommended for ages 4-7.  It was a gift for our son's 5th birthday and it is at least a year too small.  It looks more appropriately sized for a preschool child.  It seems to be well made but it is too small.,2.0
she bored with it,2.0
"Love the toy but received 3 of them and each one is damaged. The wheel which is like aluminum or something is all dented and the second one I received was filthy. Returned all 3, finally just requested a refund instead of replacement.",2.0
"My 4 year old niece loved this, although I thought the design was a bit flimsy.  If you have a child who loses interest easily this will work great as it will hold up long enough for them to get bored.  If they have a real fascination with golf or might use the toy often, don't expect it to last.  I was disappointed, would not purchase again. I have had much luck with so many Fisher Price products just not this time.",2.0
"If it is supposed to ring or chatter as these phones used to, this does nothing, except roll eyes when pulled. I didn't really see a place for batteries. Disappointed, but maybe I am not finding how to make it work and had no instructions.",2.0
"The receiver cord is ridiculously short and it interferes with play-ability not allowing the baby to pick-up the receiver without the whole phone coming along, too - smacking them in the chin. It certainly feels like a design flaw rather than a safety thing because If they had it that way to be SAFE, they'd nix the approximately 24 inch long pull cord (which I wound-up just cutting off) instead.",2.0
It's ok but the kids don't really play with it that much.,2.0
"This game is ok...it's very boring, and my 4 year old was over it the first time he played it.  Such a cute concept but the pieces are way too small and get lost so easily and now with my 15 month old, it's just not safe to even have it around.  I have small hands and it was hard for me to grasp the cherries.",2.0
there were pieces missing from the game and it was a gift.  how do I get them?,2.0
"It looks cheap, the pieces are just thrown inside the big box with not proper placing (like a cardboard structure for each size etc), some of them were a little dirty and some of the stickers on the gears were a little faded. I ordered it to give as a gift but I am embarrassed to give it, I ended up buying something else cause I didn't feel I can give this.",2.0
Junk,2.0
On line description of this telephone does not mach with what I received !!  there is no pulling rope or thread what so ever and the eyes are not moving at all.,2.0
"Lots of little tiny pieces with this.  I would not say this would work well for a 3-year-old.  A more simple set with the gears that work without adding little plastic pieces would be ideal.  I wouldn't give this to a child under 5 or 6, the pieces will just be garbage right away.",2.0
Is anyone else having trouble putting the handle on. The screw that came with it does not go all the way through to add the nut. I need help. I can complete assembly.,2.0
"I have had three of this item in the past 3 months and am not happy with any of them .I am returning the third one soon. Steering and wheels are not working correctly. Two children can tip it over also. I bought it for my grandchildren and the kids in my daycare center. A BIG disappointment for me and a BIG hassle to keep returning it to the factory.

I have the Police car and the kids LOVE it and play with it every day.

I have lots of climbers made by this same company and they have held up for years. 30 years experience in buying childrens toys.",2.0
"The box says that this is for 3 years and up, but it is difficult for even an adult.  The gears have 4 small prongs which need to be inserted into the holes on the base.  The prongs are hard to line up because you can't see what you are doing.  The people who designed this didn't test it before they put it into production.",2.0
"the fruits in this game is way too small for a kid to play with. its sometimes frustrating. i say , there are so many other games available. leave this one out.",2.0
The phone cord is too short.  The baby tries to use it and hits himself with the base of the phone.  I understand that the intent is to avoid strangulation with a longer cord but maybe no cord at all would be better.,2.0
The ''rope'' wasn't long enough neither is the telephone cord. The package was opened so I had to wash it really well. Its rarely played with if at all.,2.0
"A very long pull cord, but the handset cord is way too short to be any fun.  Again - find vintage.",2.0
Difficulty assembling unit. A piece was not connecting correctly and easily. Will be returning product.,2.0
"The junior version of the Slinky is too light on the ends to walk down steps. It barely bends. Without the weight and flexibility of the larger original one made this junior sized slinky all but missing the fun of walking. (Of course unless the ones I bought are defeative then I'm only complaining about the bads one I have now.)

Update 12/20/2009: I counted the number of ""loops"" of the junior and the bigger one. Junior has only 64 while the original has 83. The Junior slinky is only 75% of the number of loops compare to the bigger one. I also tested the plastic junior and it works fine.",2.0
"Except placing different wheels, there is nothing much kid can do or think of. Only helps in understanding how gear system works, but for that its not worth spending money.",2.0
"This car is unbearably loud, don't get on if you plan on being on sidewalks a lot. Also the steering wheel constantly comes undone and needs to by snapped back in. Not impressed with this product.",2.0
The steering wheel would not stay on...had to return. The Whisper ride II is much better.,2.0
"This is just adorable, love it !!!",2.0
"I like the fact that the child can learn counting from this game so I bought it for my 2 year old after looking at other reviews thinking it would be good for him.  When it arrived, I was surprised to see how little the playing pieces were and how hard to keep up with.  The little cherries are hard to keep hold of with your fingers too... just not easy to grasp.  I definitely would not get this for a very young child as the pieces are definitely a choke hazard.  I just didn't feel that the playing pieces or board were very user friendly even for little hands.",2.0
I remember this game being much more fun when I was little.  but my son isn't that interested in it and neither am I.  I would highly recommend the sneaky snacky squirrel game over this.,2.0
interesting. looks cool. but not all that exciting. i think i should have gotten the one that you can build into towers. much more interactive.,2.0
They were really fun for a month and then the pegs on the white pieces that snap the gears into the boards starting breaking off. :(,2.0
This toy looks like fun but is very frustrating for the kids with whom I work.  First it requires that you put the base together which is quite difficult for little hands.  Then you have to put the gears on the top and that requires advanced planning that is far too advanced for little ones until they are well into elementary school.  I presented it to several different kids of different ages and stages and it was not something that any asked to try again.,2.0
"Was recommended by a friend.  Not interesting.  Piece of cardboard with four plastic cups and tiny plastic apples.  Boo, Hasbro.",2.0
My grandson loves this little car. He has had  it less then 3 months and the steering wheel has broken off and cannot be repaired.  I'm really disappointed as the steering wheel is his favorite part of the toy.,2.0
"Its a very small slinky, its not normal size.",2.0
To.tiny,2.0
Too small to work and all my kid wanted was an original slinky to go down the stairs etc. this slinky is for looks only! Its a mini version,2.0
It TOO SMALL,2.0
Thought it was bigger,2.0
"I got this because my 4-year-old loves gears.  My kids have the Playschool Busy Gears and love them.  I thought this would be a more advanced version of that for her to play with.  I don't like this toy though because it is really difficult to put together.  My daughter likes to turn the gears with the handle, but an adult always has to build it for her.  Other kids I have seen play with this toy have a lot of trouble too.  It looks cool but isn't a practical choice for a kid.  The base is really hard to put together because not all of the pieces will interlock with each other.  The pegs that hold the gears onto the base are also very hard to put on.",2.0
"The design of this game tends to constrain player choice heavily, preventing you from hatching and executing satisfying strategies.  Most of the game result comes down to pure luck and good timing in the use of wildcards.  The reason this is the case is that the game requires a 5 in a row to win, but the rows you can play are bingo style to cards you are drawing...  So it ends up being mostly pure chance.

I do like that the game is extremely easy to learn, so from that perspective its a plus, but there are a lot of card games and board games that are just as easy to learn, but significantly more interesting from a strategy perspective.

While this is likely to be a fun family game, it's pretty terrible for adults who play board games in general",2.0
My two boys didn't find this board game very interesting at all. The game itself is cheaply made. I find the cherries all over the house as they are so small and easy to misplace. My kids prefer chutes and ladders 10x over this one.,2.0
I would not recommend this slinky because it isn't heavy enough to hold its arch and it isn't long enough to be able to walk down stairs. If I had to do it over again I would have payed the extra couple of bucks to get the original size slinky.,2.0
This sad little vintage toys always seem to get tangled within a week of kids playing with them.  I had one as a child and it was very durable.  I could send it down a flight of steps and it never had a problem.  I guess cheaper materials and smaller rings make these really just a dime store trinket.  Frustrating for a child who wants it to work as it should.,2.0
Item as described,2.0
"This might sound a little nutty, but I am an adult, and I like Slinky toys!  I bought Slinky toys in 3 sizes to put on a shelf in our den, because I like the playful architectural shape when arched on a shelf.  Unfortunately, the Slinky, Jr. will not hold an arch.",2.0
Ok toy,2.0
It's too short to work like a normal slinky.,2.0
"I am so disappointed with this version of the game.  I remember my kids liked this game - it was much better than CandyLand.  I remember it was the buckets that told you the color of the 2-4 people playing and I bought this for my grandson who is now almost 2 1/2 years old.  I liked the game in the past for the counting up to 4 and teaching colors.  In this version everyone has a different TREE and the colors are not true colors.  There's a cherry tree with light red playing pieces; an orange tree that is YELLOW; a green tree with light green apples; and worse of all, a BLUEBERRY TREE (blueberries grow on bushes) that is PURPLE.  What in the world were they thinking of when they redid this game!  They should be ashamed of themselves, making this for young kids with untrue colors and having a blueberry TREE.  My grandson likes this game but it is not the toy that I thought I was getting.  The old version was much, much better-- a fun game and learning toy.  Joyce",2.0
"The recipes were so so, and ridiculously complicated, and the mystery itself wasn't quite as obvious as a kick in the head, but nearly.  Besides which, it was scripted, you actually had to sit there and read parts, which I thought made the whole thing a little stilted.  I've definitely done better ones -- keep shopping.",2.0
"Ugh. I wish I hadn't purchased this. The toy is fine as long as your kid only wants to pull it around. But the cord to the phone is way too short - to eliminate the strangulation hazard, I suppose - and it makes it impossible to use for pretend play. Every time my daughter picks up the receiver, she ends up picking up the entire phone (which is pretty heavy) and sometimes ends up swinging it around. I was sitting on the floor playing with her and took a knock to the middle of my forehead when she picked it up suddenly and turned to me so I could ""answer"" the phone. Had a nice goose egg there for a couple of days.

I've hidden it from her until I can sneak it out of her room and throw it away. I won't donate it to Goodwill, lest some other parent be subjected to head injury.",2.0
"I had HI HOpes for this one, but that enthusiasm will have to wait. I bought this for my 3 year old son's birthday, and although he was excited by it, he's not ready yet.  First, the game pieces are TINY spheres so they are very easy to lose.  A slight bump and they are rolling off the board, slipping under the buckets, or burying themselves in my carpet.  It is nice that there is one extra piece of each color, but that's all.  Second, this game would be better for kids who are already good at taking turns so they can take advantage of learning the math concepts.  My guy still struggles with the concept of taking turns for a board game, as he is used to a lot of exploration.  This game does NOT lend itself to exploration because it is too poorly constructed and tiny.

That being said, it will most definitely resurface once he knows turn taking, has developed more patience for following game rules, and has more body control to avoid knocking the board. I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Candy-Land-The-World-of-Sweets-Board-Game/dp/B004YDFG12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Candy Land - The World of Sweets Board Game</a>&nbsp;as a better starter game.  At that point, using this game to teach addition and subtraction will be lots of fun!",2.0
Arrived as advertised and in good condition. Too small/short/stiff to do any cool slinky stuff that the big ones can do. It was a stocking stuffer for my 8 year old. It will end up in the trash soon (if not already) and be replaced by a full sized version that can actually be played with.,2.0
"Gave this to my granddaughter for her birthday -- she LOVES tattoos -- but this was a big disappointment.  She quickly got on to how it worked, but when she colored in the outline and imprinted it on her hand, the tattoo was unrecognizable . . . AND to make matters worse, it rubbed off immediately.  We read the directions carefully and tried using it a number of different ways, but always with the same result.  A waste of money, in my opinion",2.0
I thought this product would be comparable to the version I had as a kid but it didn't quite measure up. It seems smaller in size and really is not user friendly as a phone since the cord is so short (I'm sure that's a safety precaution). It can be used as a pull toy but since it's so light it flops around a lot when little kids try to pull it. Not as good as the classic.,2.0
The steering wheel was pulled out by an 11 month old baby the first time she got on it.  VERY disappointed with the quality of this toy.,2.0
"Don't get Jr. r, get the full sized slinky. Product didn't feel like the original slinky.  Full size may well be better item?",2.0
I bought this slinky along with two others.  This and a slightly larger plastic slinky were warped and unusable within the first few hours of use :(  I highly recommend the jumbo plastic slinky as an alternative.  It is still going strong months later and my kids from preschool through high school love it.,2.0
"A slinky is what a slinky is.  My five year old had fun with it - while it lasted.  By 12 hours it was all stretched out and by 48 hours it was a modern art sculpture.  I'm not really blaming it on anyone, but keep in mind that every young child I know destroys these things in a hurry.",2.0
Disappointing. Silly names - could have been much better.,2.0
"I bought this for my 14 month old son. He likes it OK, but I should have spent the extra $10-$20 and gotten the ""step 2 easy steer sportster"". This buggy doesn't maneuver very well. Trying to turn the buggy just scrapes the wheels on the cement. Not to mention it doesn't have a cup holder and it doesn't fold up for easy storing.",2.0
"Very poor quality. The steering wheel comes out since the day we got it and it just would not stay on place. The handle is very wooby No space for the feet, the kid will not be comfortable and will try to hold his feed out. He likes it as a toy but that was not the main idea. The car wheels are extremely noisy when moving, almost unbearable noise! You will not be able to hear what the person walking next to you says... it is that noisy. No cup holders. Big disappointment. Do not buy!",2.0
The I phone is a phone for my generation but nit for my baby. She hardly plays with it. I should have considered the fact that she won't accept it as a phone since there is no phone like this in any house.,2.0
"This game seems to get a lot of attention and praise. Some of my fellow revieweres here have even given it high ratings for educational value.. EDUCATIONAL VALUE??  I guess it helps in pattern and color recognition, and how to correctly count from one to five but this game has about as much educational value as watching old reruns of Leave it to Beaver and about as much strategy as connecting Legos. For good, fun and unique family games, try Carcassone, or Settlers of Catan (unfortunaly, Amazon does not carry the better board games, you have to get them elsewhere)",2.0
"Small spoiler alert: The game has a good premise, however it's one play and done, the 7-8th characters have no value, and the ending is very lame... There is really no way to solve the murder.  We played the CD on a computer and it got messed up and played the ending before we guessed.  But with the information given the ending is not even possible to guess anyways.  It was also very dated.",2.0
it is not very attractive for my baby. 8 months old. also the cord for the reciever is way too short !,2.0
"As other reviewers have pointed out, this classic toy is just as cute as it ever was but a very simple design change ruins it.

The cord is much much too short for babies to pick up the receiver and 'chat'.  They have to lift the whole phone.  I would say this was done for safety to prevent the risk of strangulation, but the cord to pull the toy is much longer.

It's a simple thing, but it keeps this toy from being a winner.",2.0
The cord on the phone headpiece is too short. It is fun for my boys to pull and play with.......just can't answer a call easily.,2.0
"A neighbor has this and her son loves it, so I bought one for my grandson for Christmas. The assembly was very difficult because the cut-out for the steering wheel retaining ring was not large enough to allow the retaining ring to go into place. I had to cut the hole larger with a knife and file it with a file in order to get the steering wheel on. It took me longer to do that than the rest of the assembly! Another piece also had excess plastic around the hole, but wasn't very hard to clear out. They don't seem to have much in the way of quality control checks prior to shipping.",2.0
"I bought it without reading all of the reviews...It is for 6 actual players and two non active....I returned it as soon as I read it on the box..
Disappointed",2.0
"This is a good car but beware, the wheels are plastic. Pushing this thing around even on sidewalks is very loud! It was noticeably irritating to our little guy and was making my ears ring a little. We ended up doing a major hack on the wheels-- bought a different Step2 car with ""whisper quiet"" wheels on Craigslist and along with some nuts and bolts, replaced the wheels entirely.  Now it's a great car! Looking back we never should have bought this car.  Do yourself a favor and get one with ""whisper quiet"" rubber wheels instead.",2.0
Returned it. I'm sure a fun game but not what I was looking for.,2.0
"This item is great in theory - I didn't read anything but the party planning booklet before guests arrived (it said not to read anything else or play the CD ahead of time). I popped in the CD and instead of starting at the beginning it played the last track, said who the murderer was, and essentially ruined the game right away. My friends were good sports and still played along, but it wasn't as fun as it should have been because the ending was given away in the beginning. I enjoyed the food recommendations and would make some of the items again in the future.",2.0
You can only play this game once.  It comes with a CD that you play to advance story.  Problem is finding someone who has a CD player.  I had to use a very old laptop to play CD.  It's cool concept and tells you everything you need to pull off a murder mystery but it's only good one time after that you will always know the outcome.,2.0
This is a wonderful product but unfortunately an important screw was missing so I needed to sent it back...really disappointing because it was a Birthday gift for our 1 year old Grandson.,2.0
"My wife and I have hosted several murder mystery dinners and this one was such a disappointment. The instructions were not very clear how to go through the night like other ones I have done. We were confused throughout the night and ended up doing it wrong because the instructions were not clear. The person identified as the murderer was even told he/she was the murderer. That took out the chance for that person to be able to guess who the murderer was. Very disappointed with the product. Spelling and grammatical errors that added to the disappointment. When trying to say something about your character at times, you had to figure out what the writer was trying to say since the wording was incorrect. I would definitely look to a different company to purchase a better product.",2.0
"I know the cord is short to avoid choking or other damage to the little one, but in this case it really makes the toy unusable to ""talk"" on the phone you have to have the actually base dangling in mid air, quite awkward.",2.0

"I purchased this phone as a gift for my now 1 year old.  She loved an old pull toy and grandma's house and I thought this would be a lot of fun for her.  While it looks like the old school version, it is nothing like it at all.  The components are a very cheap plastic.  The wheels are cheap so it does not pull well.  Both strings are way to short to make this playable as a phone or as a pull toy.  I would buy something different as a pull toy if that is what you are looking for.  As for a phone, the string is only a couple inches long so she can't hold it up to her ear without bringing the whole toy with it- what a waste.",2.0
"Always fun to play these role playing games and see how people get dressed up, but having only 6 suspects instead of 8 seemed unnecessary.  Some of the actions required by the 2 non-suspects didn't seem to have any bearing on the outcome.  have played 3-4 of these games from same manufacturer and this was the worst at clues that helped you solve the mystery.",2.0
"This was the third murder kit i have bought.. the instructions were again very bad.. I tried again to be sure no one looked ahead after each
(STOP) in the booklet. that worked but the characters read the parts..out loud on the challenges and response to challenges.. very confusing with the ...you  and I  part of the dialog...The CD I played and stopped by ""pause"", after each part, and made the mistake of playing it after part 3 and we did not have the guessing, 'Who done it""...for all that attended  as the killer was revealed in the CD..If you have a part of a suspects and have a booklet it may be better, however a book for the director with: when to turn page, give clues out, guess who done it and when to put the CD on play, may help .  the play it self is fun and OK.....",2.0
"This is our second Step2 Push around Buggy that we have purchased because the first lasted 5 years.  Now the the steering wheel is flimsy and the wheels are only half a plastic wheel.  My 10 month baby loved riding along while ""turning"" the steering wheel until the plastic tube that connects it to the body snapped and the wheel detached.  If Step2 wants to trade quality for profits, they will not get return customers.",2.0

"Though this was reasonably priced, I felt somewhat let down by the contents of the box: For the size of the packaging there's really only about a folder's worth of information. It's very scripted and less serious than I would have liked. Also, it seems as thought it was designed to cater to a person who had never thrown a party of any kind before. I didn't really need recipes and wine pairings. I'd pass on this if given the chance.",2.0
This is not a reusable game.,2.0
"The handle is kind of weird and not very helpful in making turns. Since its hooked by a single screw it feels as if the handle will come out

The wheels make a lot of noise on the sidewalks

The assembly is also wierd ....beware that once the wheels are stuck to the cap, there's no way to go back and make any change",2.0
Wasn't anything like I thought it would be.,2.0
it looks cute and when one pulls it its eyes close and open. But the cord of the phone is too small. if the phone is placed on the table the receiver will not reach the child's ear until he holds the phone in his hands. It doesn't make any ringing sound or any hello or bye sound when u lift the receiver. Over all am not happy . But my son liked it however doest use it much,2.0
"Im a little on the ocd side so it bothers me that only the red ring has a rattle on half of it LOL!
My son has been teething a lot lately so drool is EVERYWHERE. I noticed there was something trapped between the yellow pole and the white base so I figured out that it unscrews. Found out it was growing mold (likely due to the saliva getting trapped). I have since thouroughly cleaned the toy but it bothers me that that was even an issue.
Apart from those two things, my son does love this toy.",2.0
"I couldn't wait to buy this for our two toddlers.  Not long after I popped it open (it is quite easy to set up, takes about 5 seconds) and attached the two tunnels, my kids were happily crawling through it.  Then.......uh oh!  With normal movement, the tunnels detached easily, the kids found it cramping to sit and play together under the dome, and they became frustrated that they couldn't freely crawl from one tunnel through the dome and out the other side of the second tunnel without getting their clothing and sneakers caught on the sides or on the velcro.

My kids are petite, and still they were clumsy inside.  They gave up on it after 20 minutes and we just packed it up for return.  I read the age guidelines and figured they'd be just fine, but aside from it folding easily and storing conveniently in a carry bag, this is not the oodles of fun that it's advertised to be.  I'd recommend a play tent that does not feature attachable tunnels....they DETACH way too easily!",2.0
"I played this with my neighbors as a dinner party idea, and we had a bit of fun with the dressing up part. The scripts were witty and generally easy to follow. Unfortunately, the answer at the end of the mystery was very unsatisfying - it failed to explain away some very suspicious acts and relied on information guests didn't possess to explain the motivation for the murder. I love the idea of a murder mystery party, but I'd turn to a different game if you're looking for a satisfying ending.",2.0
"We have used it for more than 2 months now. Getting another brand. It's just too loud on a concrete roads because of cheap plastic wheels. We still plan on using it on a non concrete like grassy area, carpeted areas etc.",2.0
"We purchased this for my daughter's second birthday. She's 33 inches tall, and it was too small for her to get in by her self. I placed her in, and the steering wheel cut into her legs. It was just too small for us. Sadly because we put it together, and with the high cost of shipping to return, we've got to keep it / donate it. This item is chalked up as wasted money for us.",2.0
"huge box for very small content made postage expensive.
I wanted structure for my party but this game has so much information that there is no room for improvisation!! I will not make the mistake of buying another!",2.0
Didn't like the way the character booklets were set up - should be easier guidelines on how to share clues and how to pursue a line of questioning to reveal more evidence - will look for another brand next time,2.0
"This game has always seemed fantastic to me, I love the way it looks and it sounds like a game that is simple to learn and challenging to play. However, I was seriously disappointed when it came. While the game is quite unique and it might be fun for some, I found the instructions to be lacking and confusing. The gameplay was a little tedious, even for my eight-year-old brother. The worst part of all was the quality of the game. It looks absolutely beautiful in the photos, but the game I got was certainly not good quality.

The wooden board has a felt bottom which sounds nice, but it was already coming off when I opened the box. The interior of the board looks like cheap MDF. Several of the buildings had little bits of wood hanging onto corners and edges, they just weren't finished right.

Sadly, I've got to say that this game just wasn't worth buying. For the price, you're better off going with one of Gigamic's games like Pylos or even that Gobblet game. Really, if you're looking for a nice looking strategy game, a decent chess set would serve you much better.",2.0
"Sorry, I don't see what all the hype is about. I found this game borderline boring. I am hostess to the girls in my graduating class of 1974, we have game night often and I think this was the worst of them all. After putting countless hours into sending invitations, preparing the crime scene, costumes, cooking dinner and dessert the game fell short of my expectations. I will never buy another! We will stick with ""Win, Lose or Draw"", ""Trivial Pursuit"", ""Password"" etc. Lots more fun and many more laughs. The whole night was a big waste of my money and the game, which cannot be played again went right into the garbage the next day. Very disappointed consumer!!!",2.0
"Outdated version, and boring plot",2.0
"A lot of people that I played this with enjoyed this mystery. They liked it so much they wanted to buy another in the series. I however personally found it less fun and more work than it was worth. However, I was also hosting. The booklet instructions were somewhat cumbersome to get use to. I LOVE being dramatic and acting but the way the 'script' was written, there was less room for creativity. Basically, everyone just reads their lines and delivers them as they wish. To me, this took out a lot of the fun.  I thought that the storyline was long winded. Some of the stereotypes that were portrayed, if applied to another race, I am sure would be considered offensive. The plot didn't seem to make much sense.  For instance: There were many red herrings.  Therefore, when it became time to deduce the right answer it was hard to figure out which was a true herring and which was a true clue. One of the clues that were given was just ridiculously obvious. Everyone in our party automatically assumed that it had to be fake because there was no way the puzzle could be solved that easily and still be fun (in our prejudiced minds).  As a result, all of the solutions each of us proposed was, in my humble opinion, much more superior to the actual solution which seemed to really come out of left field.",2.0
"While it might be a good car for a child to ride in instead of a stroller, it was taking me too long to assemble and I returned it.",2.0

"I ordered this game for a New Years Eve party. I based my entire night around it. It started off fun, but tnere were typos and mistakes in the character booklets. Also, the directions for when to play the cd were different in the booklets and on the cd and were incorrect. It told us to play the next track after round 2 and when we did, it told us the answer and we never got to finish the game or guess. It ruined the party and took all the fun out of the game. I was extremely upset and disappointed.",2.0
"I have at least one murder mystery party at my house each year.  In the past I have purchased the mysteries [...] or written them myself.  For Christmas, my parents gave me A Taste for Wine and Murder and I was very excited to try a new format.  Because I hold these parties fairly often, my friends are familiar with how these mysteries are played and are not easily confused.  We played this game with the 6 suspects and two extra characters.  My primary complaints are:

1 - The extra characters had very odd parts and the suspects had no response to their accusations.  There were confused looks all around the table whenever those characters spoke up.
2 - Characters contradicted themselves from one round to the next.  For example, round one:  ""this guy is like my son"".  Round two: ""He's a twit.""  No logic whatsoever.
3 - The booklets seem like such a great idea, but it was very unclear about how the characters should use them.  The dialogue would end and we would all stare at each other and have to ""break character"" to figure out how to proceed.  ""You want to go first?  Or should I?""
4 - We still don't really know who did it.  When we tried to play the last track of the cd, it went all wonky.  No scratches on the disk...it seemed like the original recording used to make the cd was scratched. Very unfortunate, but we had had so much wine at that point, we just laughed at the poor quality of this game.

Before we started, one of the guests asked if we could save the game materials so that his mom could borrow them to have a party of her own.  At the end of the night, he said, ""Nevermind...I think she can find something better.""

Luckily, I have such a fun group of friends we had a great time despite the confusion created by the game.  If, however, you were playing this game with people who weren't close friends, you could end up coming off looking like a disorganized host...a pet peeve of mine.",2.0
"We played this game for the first time with two adults, a 13 year-old, and a 10-year old. The instructions are poorly written; and even worse, the pieces are too big to fit the spots where they are supposed to fit. It's as if the game designer had the idea that they could use metal pieces like in Monopoly, but they were too expensive. So you never know where your piece fits, and since the instructions are unclear, it's never clear what you can or should do. Buy Blockus instead!",2.0
"It looks like an old one. The phone line is a little bit shot.  Nothing special about  this toy, my son nearly 1 year old, and he seems much more interesting in home phone rather than this one~~~",2.0

"As a child of the 60's I wanted to share the thrill of Colorforms with my Granddaughter.  I remember sitting for hours and dressing and redressing my colorform dolls.  Well fast forward to now, I didn't like this game at all.  She was completely bored after playing just one time. It is nothing like the old days.  It's more like someone had an idea to make a game on the fly.  Doesn't work for me and my pumpkin.",2.0

"A little disappointed. The toy seems old and there is nick on the phone, not like a new buy one at all. The cord for the telephone is so short that my baby has to pick up the entire toy to ""make a call"".",2.0
"I agree with previous reviewers - the cord on the phone is very short (probably 3 or 4 inches long) so that when the child puts the phone to their ear, they have to lift the entire phone.

It's cute to look at but not exactly functional or purposeful.",2.0
"The cord between the receiver and the set is way too short! And the eyes only move when u move the toy backwards, not forward. What a waste of money!",2.0
They didn't stick well at all!  Many were very small for little fingers to manage.  A disappointment.,2.0
The pieces did not stick to the board very well.  Not like the original colorforms I remember as a child.,2.0
This toy was kinda frustrating for my 17 month old. The phone cord was too short and the pull string was short as well. Maybe the pull string needs to be made of a thicker rope as opposed to the thin rope. She did like the rotary style dialing.,2.0
"Was so excited to see a Colorforms game that all my grandchildren could play as they are all different ages but I was so dissapointed when I opened the box and most of the pieces were folded and none would stick to the boards. I tried to use a cloth to clear the boards and stickers but they still would not stick. I remember playing with Colorforms for hours, this game didn't even last a minute for the kids.",2.0
I like the idea but the plastic does not adhere to the card very well.  That is my only complaint,2.0
this game was not as much fun as the other murder mystery we have played. mostly due to lack of explicit instructions as to when to play the CD and when the players were to interview each other.,2.0
"Our sons loved this game a few years back but the version our 4-year-old daughter received for Christmas was of very poor quality right out of the box. I had to use tape to get the spinner to function properly, the face cards have a slight curvature in the cardboard, and the colorforms have almost no stickiness. We are very disappointed with the quality of this product.",2.0
"I do daycare in my home and have for over 27 years and raised many children of my own.....they always loved Colorforms but I was disappointed with the game's ""stickiness"" and the children tired of it much more quickly than I had expected.  Would not recommend it for kids that are used to lots of video/electronic games....they would be bored.",2.0
"Didn't colorforms stick when we were younger? When you hold the toy upright in the holders they give you, the colorforms slide off. They work like the first three times you use the game. The idea is good but the quality is very disappointing and the child gets bored because the product does not work properly",2.0
"I think everyone deserves their money back on this one. How ironic they call it a floaty boat, when the darn thing sinks. I think fisher price should do the right thing here and give people their money back. Our 12 month old daughter doesn't even have to be playing with the boat and it ends up at the bottom of the tub. Maybe fisher price should have called this one ""sinky boat."" Sorry, Fisher Price, we like a lot of your products, but you really hit the bottom of the tub with this one.",2.0
"This is a cute game. My 3 year old had fun with it for about 5 minutes. The pieces would not stick to the faces. They only stuck after she licked them. I know, it's gross, sorry. She is a resourceful 3 year old;) cute idea, but bad execution.",2.0
"We purchased this at an upscale toy store in the Indianapolis area for my daughter's birthday. The spinner never worked (flimsy plastic inside cardboard insert...won't stay in for 9 out of 10 attempts at a spin. The colorform stickers themselves never did stick to the cardboard much and DEFINITELY did not stick back on the waxed paper where you're ostensibly supposed to store them. I've read other reviews suggesting that the formula or approach to manufacturing must have changed over the years as the new colorforms don't stick as well as the old. That's definitely my experience - this was as bad or worse as a heavily used set we bought at a garage sale when ours was fresh out of the box.

Pretty disappointing...thankfully my daughters don't seem to mind as much as my wife and I do when we attempt to play the game with them.",2.0
The phone cord on this toy is ridiculously short. I understand a long cord may be a hazard but my 14 month old can't even lift it to her ear without picking the whole thing up. Don't waste your money.,2.0
"This product arrived dried out and used-looking. The colorforms didn't stick, and the individual pieces rolled up. Terrible.",2.0
"Quality control for fisher price has gone strait down hill in the recent years.
This isn't the first defective thing we've received with the fisher price name on it.
Was so excited for my little one to have this classic toy. This one won't be able to go in the bath tub, wich is partly why I got it, as i don't think it'll be very easy to clear all the water from it.
 The Blue ring is half melted with a weird texture,  and there's a big melted indent where the hole is supposed to be in it. These rings are supposed to be smooth, not mottled like the blue ring in my photos.
 Even tho there's issues, she still loves it. But I think I'll be switching my trusted baby toy brand from fisher price, which is too bad, as I've got children ranging in age from 19yrs to 1yr....",2.0
"My kids have a lot of basic bath toys such as plastic bowls and cups so I figured I would get them some real bath toys to play with...well I might as well left this one on the shelves. It NEVER stays afloat, it just sinks to the bottom of the bathtub underneath all the bubbles and it gets forgotten about until I let the water out and pull it to shore. I agree with the other parents, the flip cabin is just useless. The only thing that gets played with is the little toys that came with it but the actual boat just stays outside the bathtub. I guess some kids just like it simple because they love the plastic cups and bowls from my kitchen rather than bath toys from the store.",2.0
"My 18 month old daughter was very excited when we brought this home, but it quickly became a least favorite toy. It is cute, but only floats if you don't touch it (silly me to think a water toy should be able to float).  The flip cabin is a useless feature.  The hook on the end is frustrating for little hands and most often used to tip over the boat. A poorly designed toy that gets little playtime in or out of the bath.",2.0
very hard for the kids just to hold on also the line was kind of short,2.0
"This toy is actually very cute/possibly fun and my 12 month son had his first ride yesterday - he seemed to really enjoy it but Im afraid it will be a short lived experience. The problems are:

1. It is advertised on Amazon as being for 18 months to 3 year olds.  However the manufacturer lists it as 9 months to 3yrs. Amazon misprinted the age range. This thing is very small - my son is big for his age and wears 18 month size (He is tall - 31 inches) - so I thought that it would be able to grow with him. He is already too big for this thing.  H may have a few months in it. There is no way he will make it to 18 months let alone 3 years old in this thing. If your child is tall/big for thier age - buy something else.

2. The tires - hard cheap plastic that are very loud and will wear out easily. The manufacturer went cheap on this and it shows. I read in another post where someone put vacume cleaner belts on the tires to quiet the ride and extend the tire life. We will try that to see if it helps.

3. The horn is very difficult to press - it requires real hand strength from me to push - no way an infant can really make the horn honk.

4. overall - very cheap for the money - should have bought a radio flyer wagon.",2.0
"We played with gave with 8 family members, four men and four women.  All the men had any easy time answering the questions for the women.  On the other hand, the questions for the women to answer were ridiculous.  The men themselves did not know the answer to about 60% of the questions.
Despite that, we had fun playing the game.  What makes it fun are your players.",2.0
"I have only played this game 2 times. Both times, I found myself wishing that the end of the game was coming soon. The object is to answer questions about the opposite sex or questions that the opposite sex ""should/would know"". I found the questions directed toward the women regarded ""mechanical"" items such as tools, auto racing, sports, etc. All the stereotypical things that men are supposed to know. The questions asked of the men regarded more feminine themes like ""what is the best cure for run in pantyhose?"" Maybe because I am too much of a feminist but I think the game draws gender lines that shouldn't be drawn. When we played, the men actually knew quite a few (more than expected) of the answers to the feminine questions and the women knew a lot of the masculine questions (which is the object of the game). But it also started discussions of ""see, I know just as much as a man when it comes to wrenches"" and the men would state things like, ""I am embarrassed to know this but..."" Which seemed to touch nerves off during the game. It sometimes literally felt like battle of the sexes and not a fun game. The answer to the women's ""know how"" were sissy and uncool and the answers to the guys ""know how"" were pertinent and important. I guess I find games like Cranium, Malarky, and Pictionary more fun with big groups. You can always do a ""guys vs. girls"" with these games too. But these games don't pick out sterotypes that should really be kept in check.",2.0

"A large group of us bought a bunch of wine and beer one cold winter's night a few years back, lit the fire and cranked the heat, and then settled in to play Strip Battle of the Sexes.  Luckily, the men were much better at the game than the women.  I give the strip version of this game an emphatic 5 stars (depending on company, of course--our group contained both a former stripper and a former model; if you're playing with say your grandparents obviously results may vary). Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the fully clothed version to anyone with an IQ over about 90.",2.0
"Initially this kit appeared to have all that we need.  Right off the bat the cable sling that comes with the kit was not large enough for a medium-sized tree.  I had to purchase more cable to make a loop.  Next, the turnbuckle configuration does not make it nearly tight enough.  You need to borrow (or purchase) a come-a-long AND a wire grip to pull it taut.

After these extras were were zipping away.  We added a seat jut by tying a disc swing onto the trolley.  A bungee brake also made it a lot more safe and fun.  We had lots of fun for a week...

Then the sad news.  With not even daily use the plastic trolley broke.  The wheels are made of plastic as well.  I now have to purchase a new trolley with steel wheels and bearings and I feel like a sucker.  Save yourself some trouble and get a better kit from a website that specializes in zip lines or research better than I did and get the parts on Amazon separately.",2.0

"We played this with a large group of friends (15).  We didn't follow the rules, we just read the questions in turn.  Keep asking men questions until they fail, then switch. One point for each right question.  The group was diverse - 30 to 50+ in age.  The younger players got more questions right.  The older players fell into the stereo typical questions.  This is really designed for an older group of adults that follow the gender rules of their society.  I think the younger you are, the more you will not enjoy this game.  We did have a lot of fun - but then again, we didn't follow the rules.  One comment said the questions were stupid - yes, they are if you are a young adult.  ""What color is the positive terminal on a car battery?""  That was for the women and I was surprised that they got it wrong - then again the leader of their group was in her late 50's.  We switched to Catch Phrase - had a lot more fun.",2.0
"I installed this kit and it was fairly straightforward.

PROBLEMS: the kit hardware will only allow mounting around a pole and/or a hook; no hook specifications or pole specifications are given. That's for you to experiment with and hope you don't destroy the kids in the process. PROBLEMS: kit is missing parts and I will have to go to the ACE to replace.
PROBLEMS: trolley rides pretty slowly - what on earth is the break-in period here.
PROBLEMS: all this zinc galvaized stuff is cheap and cheaply made - the cost of the kit is a complete ripoff

SOLUTION: the Petzl Tandem Speed trolley (80.00), two wire thimbles of 3/16"" (7.00), Wire Cable Clamps (7.00) Wire cable (1.00/ft) = 140.00 buys quality materials that would make any boyscout proud and it will last.",2.0

It could be an educational toy if you can get your kids interested in playing with it. I tought my boys would be because they love cars. As far as being durable it hasn't broken yet, but that could also be because it has not been played with.",2.0
"I bought this game for my parents so we could play it at family get-togethers. I thought it sounded hilarious and thought this would be a good way for the six of us to ""bond."" Sadly, we all hated it, and thought it took too long. I found the questions to be very sexist (though I suppose that might be the idea) and found many of the questions where either no one knew the answer or everyone knew the answer. In this day and age where gender lines are softened, there are few ""male only"" and ""female only"" questions.

If you're looking for a guys vs. girls type of game, I would recommend taking a game you already think is fun and dividing up the teams rather than spending your money on this one.",2.0
"My husband and I were excited to play this game.  However, right when we opened it up we realized the answers/questions are something a man would never guess.  The concept is boys vs. girls, but a woman could win the game VERY easily.

"We received this gift for Christmas when my son was 6 months old. Since the box said 18-36 months we didn't even open it until his first birthday at 12 months old. The buggy is super cute and he did seem excited about taking a ride in it. However, he's tall(in the 90th percentile at 12 months) and he fits very tightly in the buggy - leg, knee and feet wise. He's not yet walking so we don't have shoes so we usually put him in barefoot or with socks. Because he is cramped, he tends to throw his feet out the side and because he's so tall they scrape on the ground. Not just the bottoms but when you push the buggy, the top of his feet scrape the road/sidewalk and get cut up and get caught under the back wheels of the buggy. It makes it impossible to use the buggy. We should have used it when he was younger. Otherwise, its a cute buggy!

Update: So, we tried this buggy a handful of times from 12 - 18 months of age but he's just too big. By 18 months my son was wearing size 8 shoes so his feet did not fit in the buggy with shoes. A size 7 was a tight squeeze. He is 30 inches tall and very thin and his belly is tight against the steering wheel. He can't even really hold the wheel to pretend to drive because his elbows are out to the sides.

I was so disappointed that we had this basically brand new buggy in our garage that I finally brought it into our living room at 22 months of age. His feet fit into the foot slots without shoes on, so we leave it in the house without the handle. We push him around sometimes, he pushes it around himself, and he uses it as a chair to watch tv sometimes. He plays with the hood and hides toys inside. So, we're at least getting some use out of it.

I think a better age range for this is 9-24 months. Oh, and I forgot to mention that it's suer loud with the wheels rolling on the road/sidewalk. And it's a little annoying that you need to lift the front wheels to turn the buggy.",2.0
"I enjoy playing pretty much all board games so you will find some enjoyment out of this BUT prepared to be frustrated. All the questions the females have to answer are about sports and tools. The questions for guys are often about fashion and cooking. I don't know a guy who doesn't cook. Maybe it is just the men I know, who watch foodtv or watched VH1s fashion show, but the men always seem to know the answers. The questions aren't balanced well from male to female. Some are just so obvious that a child could get them. And many seem to be very stereotypical of the ideals of the 50s household of husband and wife. I have only played this twice with my husband and two other couples and it was the same time each time. I would recommend Scattergories instead. That is a lot of fun!",2.0
"I was looking forward to playing this game with my girlfriend and another couple, but it was awfully disappointing.  The biggest problem is the directions, which are so vague and confusing that we basically had to make up our own rules (in terms of board movement, etc.)  Incidentally, the board itself that came with the game I bought is very different from the one in the picture above.  Another problem is that the questions are often much too difficult - the majority of the time, neither the men nor the women would know the answer.  It's mildly entertaining, but if you're looking for a way to pit the men against the women, just buy Cranium and play with gender-based teams.  You'll have considerably more fun.",2.0
"The cars stack but tenuously enough that the slightest bump knocks them over.  Worse still, the wheels do not spin well so that the cars do not go nearly as fast as a hot wheels or even one of the ""little people"" cars.",2.0
The zipline is ok. Hard to get the cable exactly where it needs to be in order to slide. Directions are not easy. My son spend his birthday money on this item. I know he's disappointed in it. He was so excited to get it up and running.,2.0
"I was really excited when I bought this for my daughter but boy, it sure is LOUD!!! It is extremely noisy when pushing on the sidewalk and makes it difficult to have a conversation if you are walking with someone else. My 14 mo old daughter doesn't seem to mind and she seems to enjoy it but I sure wish I took time to read not only the 5 stars reviews which didn't mention about the loudness of the tires. Especially after using my neighbor's radio flyer which has rubber tires, it sure makes a huge difference! I would have been glad to spend the extra money and exchange this one except after only one use around the neighborhood, you can already see the scratches on the wheels. So unless you don't mind dealing with the loud noise, you may want to check out other similar toys that have rubber tires instead. In addition, I agree with another reviewer that at best, I can see my daughter still liking to ride it perhaps til 2 while on the other hand I can see still using a radio flyer til age 4 or even older, not to mention having an extra space for another child, a diaper bag, a blanket, or even a small dog! I think it would have been a better value overall. Otherwise, I think a push tricycle would also be more enjoyable after age 2. And lastly, I wish they created a plastic key ignition instead of the stickers it came with! Aside from the wheels and horn your child can play with as he/she sits there, rest are just stickers you put on. Anyway just somethings to consider before buying!",2.0
"I thought this was a cute idea. Perhaps my baby is too young for this toy at 9 months, but she showed no interest in this toy whatsoever. After 2 weeks of ignoring this toy, I returned it to the store. The car on top never stayed there, it seemed to fall off the top way too easily. These seem cheap and are hollowed out cars that do not roll well at all when compared to the other Fisher Price cars for babies. The paint comes off easily, which seems very dangerous for babies, who put everything into there mouths! I can not recommend this toy.",2.0
"This is a good product, only thing is that it's a miniature version of the real game. For a few more dollars I got a full size board and stones.",2.0
"I had my eyes fixed on this item, thinking that i will get it for my son and push him to the park.  But I went to the store, and pushed this car out of curiousity.  Boy it was hard on the arm because the front wheel doesn't turn!  So in order to turn the car, you have to lift the front a bit, kind of like the jogging strollers.  I already have a jogging stroller, and am not looking to jog him in this push car.  It was hard to push even on the nice smooth floor of the store, I can't imagine how hard it would be to push it on the pavements, or off road in the park.  If you are looking to push in straight lines, or workout your forearm, go for it!",2.0
"This toy did not match my expectations. I was so keen on taking my 13-month old baby for a fun ride... Her knees already block the steering wheel! Isn't this supposed to go from 9 months to 3 yrs!! Not at all!

The wheels are so loud when rolling and not smooth at all! They were so loud I was embarrassed with my neighbors... Also, my daughter kept sliding down the seat - I guess the belt is positioned too low... What I found the most uncomfortable to deal with is that the wheels do not turn! So you have to drag it to do so... I don't want to sound too picky buy all of these should have been considered by the maker... anyway, I took it back and hope to find something more friendly for both baby & me!",2.0
"Wow! This ride on is great. I have two little girls 16 mo. and 4 years old that started riding on this before they were a year old. The back of the seat gives great support for the little one, the width is wide enough so they don't slide off to one side or the other, and it has a seat belt!! My daughters loved to ride down the sidewalk pretending to steer all the way. It has a horn that beeps, a key, and the trunk in the front is great for stuffing toys, blankets or what ever you don't want to carry along with you on your journey. The trunk is easy to open and close, my daughters spent many hours on this, and my little one still loves to jump on and go for rides. I have recieved numerous complaiments with this cute toy. It's soo easy to put in your trunk or the back seat, and the kids just love riding on it. We used it for Halloween for each of my daugters when they were too young to walk fast enough with the rest of the group and it can pretty much go through any terrain like nothing.  My only complaint is that the steering wheel broke off one time and no matter how many times we glue it together it won't stay on and the back wheels have begun to crack down the middle of each tire. But I know it has been used many many times also.",2.0
"I should have read the reviews before buying. This toy is incredibly poorly designed. My 3 year old son needs help with every aspect of it. It is hard even for me to fit the Rescue Heroes in, the rescue hoist rope is very difficult to play with, my son likes the toy, buy unless you have lots of time to play with it also, do not buy it. I am just waiting for the chance to get rid of it!",2.0
"Hello, I purchased the Fisher Price Quick Response Helicopter at Christmas, keeping it until my grandson's 4th birthday.  He likes action toys and I thought this would be perfect for him. However, the retracting pack holder and the rescue rope were missing from the package.  I notice right away for a small child, the helicopter does not stand alone, except when on the platform.  The plastic cover over the seat comes off too easily, also.  We both are disappointed in the new product. We haven't been able to use the retracting pack, since it is missing.  Thanks! Bette Somers",2.0
"I got this for my daughter for her 1st birthday. She always wants to go for a ride in it but she has been too big for it since she was about 15 months old. Her feet and legs do not fit in the space provided so they drag on the ground on the side. The designers should think about providing leg space under the front section like in a normal car instead of devoting all the space to the ""trunk"". Granted, my daughter is tall (at 23 months she is 38"", 35 pounds, size 8 foot) but this didn't even fit her when she was 15 months old. I wasn't impressed with the horn on this either - I can make it work, but my daughter can't. The last thing that turns me off about this toy is that it is VERY noisy when riding on the sidewalk or street - everyone can hear you coming a mile away. I didn't have any problems with the handle falling apart like some others did, in fact it seemed very sturdy, just small. I'd suggest looking around for something else.",2.0
"I am happy with the quality of the loops but what I am unhappy with is that one color may cost $7.50 for a 3.3 oz. bag and another color may cost $14.55 for the exact same size bag.  This makes NO sense or me, whatsoever!",2.0
"I purchased this Item for my nephews after purchasing it for my own son ,in which he didn't recieve his at all After reviewing it and hearing the complaints of my nephews that the heroes would fall out when helicopter is move right or left. Unlike the jet it doesn't have somewhere to plug the heroes in for security or protection of falling out. The jet is wonderful, the helicopter just needs a plug, than it too will be a great toy. I'm waiting for it to be made better ,than I too will repurchase this item.",2.0
"My daughter loved to ride in her car from 9 months to 15 months but now she is bored with it when I put her in.  She puts her feet down on either side while I am pushing which scuffs the tops of her shoes very badly and makes me nervous that I might hurt her her if I go too fast.  My other gripes are that to turn it you have to push down on the handle to lift the front tires off the ground - seems like this would wear on the handle.  On the first car we got the pin to attach the handle would not fit through the holes, so we had to return it.  Lastly - it would be much better if the wheels were rubber.  The plastic wheels are very noisy.  The whole neighborhood knows when we are coming.  Overall, it is cute and it makes younger babies/toddlers feel big but if your child is like mine with the ""I want to do it myself"" attitude, they may get bored with this toy quickly.  Check out toys that they can grow into a little better",2.0
"Thick and knitted, not the smooth fabric that I was hoping for.  Also very thready, leaving tails that need clipping.  Am going to have to repurchase another brand so my daughter can finish her project, as these won't work. :p  Ended up finding some much better one by ""made by me"" brand at my local Wallyworld.",2.0
"The loom is good - metal, not plastic.  The loops, however, are terrible!  I made potholders as a kid and I remember them being like soft cotton tshirt.-like material.  These are very loosely woven and have so many frayed edges that you can't make a nice looking holder.  Also, not all of them fit - some are very stretched out.  I'm surprised by all the great reviews.  Now I have to go find different loops.",2.0
"The loops I received were more of a pea or sage green, not the green pictured. I had wanted to make Christmas colored potholders, but this color won't work. I hope it's an error on Amazon's end because the loops had no original packaging.",2.0
They are not very good. They have stings ever there. Will not buy again,2.0
"color not as good as depicted in picture.  I really wanted the earthy colors like flax, gray, etc, but I could only find them on amazon in the 10"" size, so I ordered the best color I thought in the 7"".  After I already made the pot holders, I found ALL of the earth colors in the 7"" that Amazon offers in the 10"".  bought over $50 worth of loops 'from the other guys' because they had the right colors in the right size.",2.0
"Its OK .. takes fast pushing to get the balls popping. The wheels don't move as well as I thought they would, use it on thick carpet .. doesnt work on anything else",2.0

Product received was scratched,2.0
it amazes me that they can make products that simply don't work.  This train can't even climb a hill with more than two cars attached.  It derails almost instantly as it approaches curves.  My son wants it to work so bad that he just squeals with frustration.,2.0

Disappointing.",2.0
Not very interactive. Kids usually loose interest quickly.,2.0
"I always like Fisher-Price products, but not this one. I'm surprise the design of the top ring hurts my sons teeth and gum. The surface of the top right (red one) is not smooth - I don't know why and what is the purpose for. My 6-month old always cries out when he chews on it (I know it doesn't suppose to be chewed). My husband and I suspect my little one may suck his upper teeth in the middle of the gap. Therefore, I throw the red rings away and just use the remaining donuts.",2.0
"Looops are of muchlooser weave, less flex color different from last batch

Too small and not as cool as the original ones,2.0
"This train is very weak: it moves backwards and forwards slowly, is barely able to go up and down low bridges and cannot go over any more substantial bridges at all, can only pull a few trains, etc. The train also is made out of cheap-seeming plastic. This is not the standard I would expect from Brio trains. (In contrast, the battery-powered Percy we purchased is a little work-horse.)",2.0
My son does not seem to be interested in this. So was waste of money for us.,2.0
"I think these ere overpriced for what we got, just enough loops to make two potholders.",2.0
"This thing stinks. The wheels just slide along the wood floor without rotating. And it only ""pops"" about every 8 revolutions or so. I think the idea is ""how cheaply can we make it and people will still buy it?"" I had a hand me down one from my sister's kids that has better construction, better popping. I'm disappointed.",2.0
"Really tough for a toddler to do, the recommended age range is too low, in my opinion. The pieces are all funny shapes, and it's hard to determine exactly where they go when disassembled. I am a HUGE puzzle builder, and have several thousand+ piece puzzles in my collection... but wouldn't buy this again, except maybe for an older child who is really into puzzles (I'm thinking 10+ yrs or so).",2.0
We bought several Ravensburger puzzles and this was the only disappointing one...,2.0
I thought the cardboard game piece fit into the box.  It does not.  You have to put in on the floor or table and it does not lay flat and the marbles go rolling off.  I bought this for my grandchildren and they found it to be too much of a hassle to play.,2.0

"I couldn't tell from the photo but the playing board is made from cardboard. This means the holes are barely deep. The marbles don't stay in place well. It's also cheap cheap cheap.  I thought it was the metal board version. We're thinking of it as a tester. Once we know our family will play Chinese checkers often, we'll upgrade. But, had I known, I would have just ordered the more expensive metal version to begin with.",2.0
The clear part came all scratched up,2.0
"The product itself is great. I ended up buying at  a local craft store white model magic because what was delivered to me was green. I used it for a halloween costume, a unicorn horn, and absolutely loved it! Buyer beware though, what you order might not be what you get.",2.0
This set is cheap cheap cheap. The board is flimsy and had to be taped together when we got it and the marbles are light and not real marbles. The game is still great but it was very frustrating for my son since every time he touched the board they all moved.  Ok who am I kidding it was frustrating for everyone involved!!!,2.0
Not made like they used to be. You have to push really hard to get the balls to actually pop. My little one can't push hard enough to enjoy that.,2.0
"While it's true that it's easy for children to mold with it's actually TOO soft for serious users who are trying to make a piece with any detail. It squishes easily and destroys the area that you previously sculpted! It also does not dry as hard as other sculpting clays so some delicate pieces end up breaking eventually. An example is a smiley sun magnet with wavy 'Rays' that my daughter made. After a week or so the rays broke off one by one and now we have the Walmart logo as a refrigerator magnet! lol
The pluses are these.
No odor
No staining on work surfaces, hands, or clothing.
No need to bake - hardens (somewhat) with air drying.
Very nice vibrant colors.
To sum up - it's perfect for young children but older children and adults will get better results with Sculpey Clay.",2.0
"This product used to be great when it was first released by Crayola but this last purchase was disappointing: the material couldn't be shaped into as fine of points (less definition) and actually rounded out and lost shape as it dried. The bag seemed completely sealed when it arrived, but upon opening the material felt like it was already drying out and I'm not sure if that is intended or I received a dud batch.

When the item that I made dried, the points were far less defined than I wanted. Trust me, I'm no Michelangelo but  I did expect this stuff to hold its shape and not look like a smooshed marshmallow after my hard work. On the upside, the coloring did not imprint on my hands or the surface, although its probably best to use wax paper to cover the table.",2.0
"My 7 year-old daughter begged for ""bendaroos,"" which are sold on TV. I purchased these instead, which are basically the same thing. When she finally got them she only played with them for about 5 mins.  You basically just twist the waxy sticks into different shapes.  I think maybe it would have been very popular 50 years ago; but today kids are so used to high-tech toys that something this simple and ""quiet"" is not as appealing.  Sad, but it is what it is.  The product description says that it comes with a ""handy storage bag"" but does not -- unless they are referring to the plasic bag that they come in and in which you have to rip to open. I read some of the other reviews before I purchased this, and think that they must have been referring to toddler-age children that can still find fun in the simple.",2.0

"i bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for christmas, it is a cute game and she liked it but after playing it 2 times the outfits wouldnt stick on the people anymore. so its a waste now it just sits there and theres not alot of outfits for the girl dolls mainly blue and boyish. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",2.0
"I had high hopes for this, since I remembered these from when I was young.  Unfortunately, we had to do some quick explaining at Christmas when we opened the package and there were no stickers!  I ended up just throwing the game away.",2.0

Does not come in the RETRO BOX pictures...comes in the Toy Story box. This was for a movie with my daughter wanting the box for the old time aspect.,2.0
"""Best New Game at the British International Toy Fair!"" shouts the box. I was a little surprised, never having heard of Word Thief (Faby Games, Inc., 1994 - no designer credited). But one should never pass up a 75% off sale at Barnes and Nobles, right? So I snagged it, hoping that it would be another good word game to add to my collection.

Was I smart to pick up this game? The short answer is that for the price, I got a good deal! It's a fun game, but not so much fun that I'll play it often. I'll tell you a bit more about it.

First, a description of game play...

The game is for two to four players. A deck of 108 cards is shuffled. The deck is composed of twenty-six cards of four suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs), and four jokers. Except for the jokers, each card has a letter and a number on it. The number corresponds to the frequency of the letter (an ""A"" is worth 1 point, while a ""J' is worth 8 points). Each player turns over a card, and the player whose card is closest to ""A"" goes first. Each player gets seven cards dealt to them. One card is flipped over, and the suit showing on it is considered the ""trump"" suit for this game. The first player takes their turn, with each player following clockwise.

On a turn, a player can use any of the cards in their hand to make a word. The word must be able to be found in a standard dictionary. They place the word in front of them, scoring points for that word. Points are kept on a score pad provided, or by taking poker chips equal to the points received (white chips are one point, blue chips are 5 points, and red chips are 20 points). If a word has five letters or more, the player receives five bonus points. A six-letter word gets the player 10 bonus points, and so on. If all the letters of a word are the same suit, the player scores double points, and triple points if they are all from trump suit. A player who uses all the cards in their hand gets another bonus of twenty points.

Not only can a player use cards from their hand, but they can ""steal"" words that have been played by previous players. A word cannot be stolen if it is all of the same trump, as it is considered ""Wordlocked"". Otherwise, a word may be stolen, and the letters used to form new words (as long as every letter from the stolen word is used). Whenever a player steals a word, they must add at least one letter from their hand to the word. They may steal a word and break it down into two or more words. The player whose word is stolen loses the points they gained for that word. Players cannot steal their own words, and may only steal one word from other players.

Jokers can count as any letter, but are not worth any points. If a player cannot make a word from their hand, or steal from another player, they lose five points, draw a card, and skip a turn. Otherwise, a player scores points for the word(s) they create and draw cards to replenish their hand to seven cards. When every card from the deck has been dealt, and one player uses all their cards (or no one can make a word), the game is over. All the cards still in players' hands are deducted from their scores, and the player with the highest score is the winner!

Some comments on the game:

1). Components. The company that made Wordthief was obviously trying to go for a ""poker"" feel, with the different suits and poker chips. It's strange to see a game that actually provides two different ways to score. Using the chips may be more fun, but the included score pad is very nice, and I think that we would use that more often, as it's much more convenient to write down numbers than to count out chips. The cards are of extremely high quality, and very easy to read. All cards are printed both ways, so that the letters can be read from either side of the table. Each suit is in a different color, helping to more easily distinguish between them. The box is a smaller type box, but has a plastic insert that holds all the components well, including the poker chips. Good components are found in this game.

2). Rules: The rules are written well on three small pages. However, the company decided to write the rules via bullet points, and wrote a few of the rules out of order, in my opinion. It's not too hard to figure them out. I just think the rules could have been better organized. One thing that did impress me was that on the last page of the rulebook, there is a chart showing the letter distribution of the cards of each suit and the value of each card. There is a card included with the game that also shows the same information. Both of these charts are very convenient and appeal to the people who like to analyze games and count cards. The rules for the game are easy to teach and learn, and a game can be up and running within five minutes.

3). Strategy: We quickly found that it's good to form words of one suit, regardless of how big the words were. Not only did that give you double or triple points but the word wouldn't be stolen by anyone else. In the first game we played, I consistently had words that I made stolen by other players, until I ended the game with one word! A bit of frustration could settle in, if the cards a player get aren't conducive to this. However, if a sharp eye is kept on words that are played by other players, this can be rectified a bit. Strategy for making words is very similar to the strategy found in Scrabble.

4). Fun Factor: It's great fun to steal an opponent's word, and great agony when your words are stolen. I wasn't pleased to have words stolen every turn, but it didn't turn me off from the game; it just made me resolve to steal words back from other opponents. The jokers are incredibly useful, as they can be any letter, any suit, and are often used to help lock up words. Everyone who played the game enjoyed it, and had fun. However, the fun wasn't great enough that everyone asked to play the game that often. It's occasionally asked for, but other word games get more prominence.

5). Education: As with all word games, this one can be used to help teach spelling to children and students. Some people may be put off (or turned on) by the poker theme, but I found that the theme barely touches the play of the game. As with Scrabble and Crossword Pyramids, this is an excellent game to teach spelling.

6). A game is short, ranging from 30 to 45 minutes. Players may wish to play in two rounds, with a different suit from ""trump"" each round.

To sum it up, I think the game is fun, and educational. But I don't think it's one of the best word games out there. It's a good game, and probably won't be a waste of your money (especially at a 75% off sale). But there are so many other games you could spend your money on, and to buy this before many of them would be a crime. Word Thief is fun, but I think you should pass it up and wait for a better game.

"Disappointed. I had so much fun with this toy from my childhood that I got it for my grandchild. It is really not the same.  Due to concerns of choking they have shortened the rope to make it useless (now I understand why kids don't use pull toys much any more).  Also the slinky part has been tied with a string down the center so it is stopped from stretching very much....the movement of stretching out long and then pulling up short just is not there any more.  And the back legs don't move easily so the dog does not really walk at all on a rug, and not too well on hard wood floors either......instead the top rear just collapses over the slinky.  Basically this toy is not much fun, unlike the original.",2.0
"Too loud, and I am not one to complain about noisy toys usually. Also, it takes some effort to make it ""pop"" and move forward, so my boy only developed interest for it after 1.5 yrs if age, while other push toys were exciting for him before he was 1.",2.0

"This would be ok for a younger child. However, the ""pulling string"" is so short that you can NOT pull it AROUNG on any type of floor.
The item is very hard to stand up on its 2/4 paws*..making it frustrating for a child to try to play with it.
My son had ""interest"" in this one for about ten minutes until he got so aggravated with trying to just stand it up that he threw it into his toy box and has NOT. Tried it since Christmas morning.
I would suggest this toy for a child from 1-3 years old ONLY... As it would only disappoint older children.",2.0
My 7 month old loves the top ring because it has beads inside that move and make noise. She had not touched the rest of the product because it has nothing to encourage interaction or draw baby's attention. Maybe she is too young for it as she is not stacking things yet. I would not order this product again.,2.0
This thing is too small for most stairs,2.0
"Crayola makes the best crayons, don't get me wrong. This box of crayons is actually several smaller boxes of the exact same colors. I was expecting a large variety of colors instead of just a large amount of the same colors.",2.0
"my baby is scared of this thing! the popper is so loud, everytime i show it to him, he runs to a corner in his room all terrified. not only that, im so dissapointed i thought this thing would stand by itself but it doesnt.. the sticker comes easily out like if it was put there in a rush, and the plastic on the popper is all stained and scratched, didn't like it, sorry",2.0
"We like to play but the quality of the titles is not good, those look so CHEAPER!!!. I paid for a good quality but we are so disappointed I won't recommended to my friends",2.0
Too short to do tricks or stairs.  Much smaller than original!,2.0
Not the original. It does not walk down steps because the slinky is not long enough. I could not even get it to walk down a  slanted flat surface,2.0
"My 3.5 year old son is obsessed with Toy Story.  He has wanted every character from the movies and when he wanted Slinky Dog, at first we bought this one from Target.  I have to say this is one of the more annoying toys we have ever purchased.  It's loud and cumbersome for him to play with.  We ended up returning it to Target and purchasing the smaller version of this toy from Amazon.  Not only was the scale much better (this Slinky Dog is HUGE and CLUNKY) but he liked  the smaller one much better.  It is the only time in his life he has ever let me return one of his toys.  The durability of either of these toys isn't great.  Much like a normal slinky.  Expect kinks and bending etc.  I recommend getting the smaller one.  Cheaper and does the job for you Toy Story lover.",2.0
Only getting 2 stars because my daughter likes it. It won't stand up or stretch out. Not as quality as the original. Would not buy again!,2.0
My daughter only liked to sit on it and play the thingy with the balls. Never rode it. Other kids didn't care for it either. I gave it to salvation army.,2.0
"Very disappointed in this purchase to say the least. When I ordered I assumed it was a box of 120 different colored crayons. Instead I received two of the same boxes of 60 count crayons. Of which one box received with every single crayon broken in multiple pieces the other box was fine (received in same package). Which leads me to believe they were sent broken, I don't think it happened I'm delivery process. Needless to say I wouldn't recommend buying these, they were misleading about what I was receiving and couldn't even use 60 of the crayons.",2.0
"I love the original slinky, but it's too short for my stairs.",2.0
Was tangled and unreparable within 10 minutes of opening. I should have known.,2.0
Too light weight to pop on hard floor; you have to push down really hard to get it to pop. Pops on carpet (because wheels only roll on carpet) but not great.,2.0
My son didn't care for this very much,2.0
"Returned this item because my little one would get his toes rolled over on whenever he slipped backwards on this tricycle. Really wanted to keep it, but it just didn't work out. Didn't steer very well either.",2.0
"We've had this for several month now, but my son doesn't ride this at all. I think he doesn't like the two wheels in front that there is no room for his legs to proceed. We wasted money on this trike.",2.0
would not slink,2.0
Sadly the width of my stairs wouldn't allow the slinky to stretch that wide to catch onto the stair below & when we would push it onto the next stair it would just sit there....these are stairs inside my home...they are not special stairs they are just standard style that comes with a 2 story house.  I have carpet so I don't know if that was also the problem.  Sadly my son never played with it again.,2.0
Too stiff to use down stairs,2.0
I remember slinky's being able to go down stairs.,2.0
It bent after 1 use and it doesn't really go down the stairs. Was left with a disappointed 4 yr old who was looking forward to the slinky down the stairs.,2.0
We ordered this game and quite a few numbers on the tiles were worn and hard to see we have only played once and are dissspointed we have purchased a new one .,2.0
I purchased this toy over others after reading so many positive reviews.  I am extremely disappointed with this toy.  My son (16 months) seemed to like it at first but it seemed he could only go backwards.  When attempting to go forward his feet would get stuck by the wheels and the wheels barely turn as is.  I should've saved my money.  It is a great toy if you want your child to just sit and go absolutely nowhere!!,2.0
"I do like this toy, however it's already splitting behind the seat on the red part where the seams meet.  My daughter rides it around the house and has a lot of fun but I'm not sure how long it will last with the split in the back.  I probably wouldn't buy this again because of that.",2.0
"Not sure what it was about this, but it's not like I remember.  The toy has no real flexibility in how it can be used.  Basically, stack the rings in the right order, and rock the whole thing back and forth to make the rattle make noise.  Boooring.  Even for my 8 month old.  He had absolutely no interest.  Go for the stacking cups instead.",2.0
Sadly this broke within a day or so. Pretty typical for a slinky cheapo thing. Lucky I only paid a couple of bucks for it.,2.0
My daughter loved it. But boy this thing is a headace,2.0
"Not meant for an athletically competent toddler... too hard to ride well and fast.  I bought this for my 17-month old.  While it is true that it is easy to get on and doesn't tip over, the wide wheels in the front mean that he can't really get his feet forward enough to push off well.  He has to push off in choppy steps from the level of his body backwards, which is not satisfying for long.  It's his only trike right now, so he still likes it, but often he ""rides"" it by standing up and walking along with the trike between his legs, carried by his hands on the handlebars!",2.0
"This ride on toy was given as a gift for my son's first birthday. My son would rather push this toy around than to sit on it and take it for a ride. He'd enjoy it if I were pushing him around but I'd have to teach him to keep his feet up or it'll hit the wheels. After minutes of pushing and my backaches, the fun is done and he just wanders off and looks for something else to play with. Also, this toy is very lightweight so when he tries to get on or off this bike without assistance,it'll tip or slide, making him lose his balance and fall. There are other toys out there that would be more exciting and less painful.",2.0
"My child loves to sit on this toy and push it, but she has gone forward over the handlebars a number of times when she actually tries to ride it forward (she was 12 mos. when we got it, and is now 18 mos.). It is NOT as steady as the name. I would NOT let a child ride this alone EVER, even in the house.

edited 12.08....now that I have 3 children, I can see that this is a sturdy outside toy. My other 2 children have not had problems with tipping or moving it forward, like my first child did. As an outside toy, it is very durable, and even though my current baby likes to stand on the seat, he has not gotten hurt on this, even if he falls in the grass. It has lasted better than some other toys we have had. It is safer as an outside toy, because there are too many sharp corners on furniture to fall on....",2.0
"We bought this toy last year for our daughter's first birthday.  Although it is pretty stable, she couldn't really push herself around.  When she did start moving around she was pushing backwards (something that most children do first) and so she would run over her feet with those two wheels in the front.  She is now two and a half - she can use it now, but rarely plays with it.  She is ready for a ""real"" tricycle, and has little use for this one.  I would say to skip this toy.",2.0
"My child received the toy as a birthday gift. When she was 14 months old she tried it and had difficulty pushing it so she would stand up and fall straight forward. So I decided to put it away for 2 months. Now that she is 16 months she tried it again, but now her feet get stuck under the trike, and when she try's to get them out or push she falls forward again,and my child isn't tall so it is not the height or weight.  Personally of all the good fisher price toys I have bought this one is going in the trash. I will not let my child try it again.",2.0
I bought this toy for my 18 month old son as he is quite small.  The back wheels do not turn properly outside and they are very quickly wearing out as they are plastic.  He is very frustrated with not being able to go anywhere when he rides it.  Perhaps it is best used indoors as some of the other reviews suggest.,2.0
"Very disappointing. Not the original. Smaller in length and circumference and does not have the satisfying ""SLINK"" of the original.  False Advertising!",2.0
I really didn't think this was a good game,2.0
"This toy is cute, however, it is NOT BPA-FREE. Just a warning for those parents whose baby/toddler will mouth it. BPA is a known carcinogen.",2.0
"cheaply made , wheels lack any sort of traction and they slip instead of turning causing the toy NOT to pop as intended.",2.0
"This shouldn't advertise itself as the ""original"" slinky as it's much smaller than the ones I used as a kid. It's maybe 2.5"" across and too short to go down stairs. That said, it is good quality/well-made.",2.0
"It wasn't what I expected. It is not capable of ""slinking"" down my steps which is the only reason for the purchase.",2.0
"after 3 years, all pieces are losing the paint, numbers are getting faded",2.0
"This is a great game but this version is a far cry from the real ""original."" The tiles are about half as thick and half the weight of the originals. The plastic ""racks"" are so thin a fan will blow them off the table and you could probably wad one up like a piece of thick paper. Pressman is obviously looking to increase their profits by making the game as cheaply as possible in China. It's just not as satisfying as the original game. Everything about it screams ""cheap"" and Pressman should be ashamed.",2.0
"This toy is annoying! If you value your peace of mind, don't buy it!",2.0
"This slinky does not perform as a slinky. This was to replace a slinky that a family member stepped on. But this one does not slink or walk down the stairs at all, unlike our prior one. It seems shorter, or maybe not as flexible. This is no ""original"", as was advertised.",2.0
Not like it is advertised much smaller.,2.0
"Sadly, this Slinky does not walk down stairs or across the room as I remember from my childhood.  I think it may just be too short.",2.0
Was a twisted mess within just a few hours of opening. Ended up throwing away. I should have just bought one at the dollar store.,2.0
does not bounce well.,2.0
"Arrived promptly. Well packaged. I have the same game from Pressman, many years old. I ordered this one for my Mom. The current version's tiles are a little thinner than the old ones; they're still ok, but my Mom liked the extra heft of the old ones. So I gave the old set to my Mom, and kept the new one for myself.

I originally gave it a four, but downgraded to two stars because the old set's colors still are vibrant after many years of heavy use; but the new set's colors, after just a year, are all worn out. The numbers were practically illegible. I had to buy a pack of indelible markers to write the numbers on the tiles again. We'll see how long that solution lasts!",2.0
"This version of Rummikub is really cheaply made, and the box that I received looked worn and used. Many of the tiles have smeared ink and other markings on them, and the boards are already scratched. I returned it. It's worth spending a few extra dollars for a better version.",2.0
"Contrary to package labeling, this is NOT THE ORIGINAL Slinky - if you go by diameter, length, or mass per coil.  It is shorter, smaller diameter, lighter per coil (haven't calculated if this is due to smaller diameter or thinner material).  If you want this to walk down stairs, it will have to be in front a museum (shallow short steps).  Standard American steps, even in my 70 year old house - no way.  These are about half the closed height of my 50 year old slinky (yeah, I actually held onto 1 that long without bending it) and feel to be made from much lighter steel. The true original's box is taller than it is wide.  The reduction in mass & length of this version makes it impossible.  Also not the current manufacturer has chosen to not comment themselves.  I think the majority of the 5 star ""oooh cool"" posts are from persons who have not actually tried to walk these.  If I hold down 1 and pull the other to the next step it will (usually) step to the 3rd one and stop.  Sorry too little mass = too little inertia.  I soldered a pair together, didn't work much better.  Additional length helped but the coils are just too light. (And off course the joint area was a bit stiff so that didn't help either)",2.0
It does not work very well.  I even have trouble using this thing!,2.0
I was disappointed when I received the toy and it was missing 5 of the cookies there should be 12 complete cookies and there were only 7,2.0
Disappointing - couldn't get it to go down the stairs.,2.0
"Came used, open, taped back together checking for which pieces are missing Very disappointed",2.0
MUST have carpet floor for this to work!  Returned item.  Only hard wood floors.  It rolls but will not pop!!!,2.0
"If you have wood floors, do not buy as this only works on carpet.",2.0
"Well, I had one as a child so thought I'd get one for granddaughter. Avoided the cheaper mini/ plastic models and went for an 'Original'.
And I set out to video the wonderful way it walks down the stairs for the benefit of Amazon customers.
But it only did 3 stairs max before collapsing on itself and having to be rescued.
It's not as big as I remember from childhood either.",2.0
"A very, very cheap knock off of the awesome original. The pieces feel cheap and light. The game ""board"" is cheap and light. The top never topples off no matter what you do because it's such light junk. We just play until the stacked pieces tip over. The one from when I was a kid was heavy, sturdy and the whole top would fall off. Would be one star but my 5 year old still had fun.",2.0
Not as fun as I would have hoped.,2.0
"I recently bought a bunch of games to play with my daughter: Yahtzee, Otello, Jenga, etc. I've never played this game as a kid. I bought it because it looked like fun but the instructions are too complicated!!  1. If you place a piece that completes a row of 5 pieces in any direction, you score 3 points for completing the row plus 1 point for each playing piece of your color that tops each other stack in that row. 2. If you add a piece to a completed row of 5, you score 1 point for each piece of your color that tops each stack in that row. 3. If you add a piece to a stack that already has 3 or more pieces high, you score 1 point for each piece of your color in that stack. Come on! Seriously? This is just how to score.  You also have to roll a dice to figure out where on the board you are going to place your piece. I prefer games where instructions are simple to understand without having to look at a diagram.",2.0
Some colored pencils broke within one use.,2.0
"I thought I was getting a simple balancing game for our preschool daughter. Not the case. There are way too many scoring rules and it barely ever topples. We have three daughters ages 9,12 and 5 and none of them liked this game.",2.0
"We went through all the rules and played a couple times, but it didn't really keep the kids attention. They were done with it after one turn.",2.0
Too short. The most exciting thing a Slimky is supposed to do is walk down stairs. It doesn't,2.0
Box was smashed. it is a Christmas present. I hope the inside isn't broken!,2.0
Very cheap,2.0
I purchased two of these to give gift but both recived in damaged package. Both boxes were broken.,2.0
"it busted in the first hour, the rings bent and then it no longer was able to slinky down the stairs",2.0
Got broken pencils and ripped up packaging,2.0
two stars.. one for making the most annoying toy ever and another  one for making my son happy while he annoys the crap out of everyone. ;),2.0
"broke the first day but before that we could not get it to ""walk"" down the steps.",2.0
"I love slinkies and this one is cool, but I really regret paying as much as I did",2.0
"will not slinky down the steps,",2.0
you get what you pay for... cheap plastic... but daughter was ok with it,2.0
"The toy seems really great but my son has shown no interest in it whatsoever. He has it out over a month now and he hasn't gravitated towards it yet. He puts everything in his mouth, so i thought that maybe just to chew on it he would do that. I guess he just doesn't like the thing.",2.0
"It didn't go down my stairs at all. It looked nothing like the slinky I had as a child. I didn't have issues with the size, but I remember the slinky I had would go down the stairs. Maybe my stairs are a little too high now. I would not purchase again.",2.0
"the tray is too wobbly, for little hands to control round circles. Too complicated to remember each tier for age group",2.0
Product arrived damaged and these were purchased as Christmas gifts.,2.0
"I received 23 of 50 pencils in my package- less than half. Therefore, the number of stars for this purchase is less than half. Ridiculous. I don't even know how this sort of thing happens. Especially considering the package cost $7.",2.0
Broke/ deformed easily. Not sure why i thought a metal slinky was a good idea.,2.0
"I believe the one I received was defective, the wheels wouldn't roll to make it pop! Took it apart to see if I could fix it and determined the axle to be ever so slightly bent as to cause one wheel to rub against the body of the toy. That said, the wheels would have to roll effortlessly for this thing to work, because it's got no weight to it to push the wheels down against the floor to give it traction to roll. The wheels are smooth, and the defective one I had just slides on the floor unless you push down on it.",2.0
My daughters had no interest in this toy.  A couple of times I saw my youngest use the rings for bracelets otherwise it didn't get played with.  It was a waste of money and I would not buy this again for another child.,2.0
The product was exactly as described- shipping however was the issue 2 boxes of color pencils shipped together in a bubble pack - boxes opened so I received a bag full of 100 pencils,2.0
Package arrived with pencils spilled everywhere in box and tips all broken.,2.0
"My son was excited to get his first slinky. I was excited to show him how it walks down stairs. This slinky is nice but not big enough to walk down our hardwood stairs- dissappointing. It's a nice slinky other than that, but it didn't last long in my 3 year old's hands haha",2.0
"Does not go down stairs, don't think it is a actually the original. Smaller in diameter than the original.",2.0
It's tiny. I am insulted to even receive this in the mail.,2.0
box was all ripped up so not very happy since it was a gift.  This had to have been done before it was boxed.,2.0
"We received this as a gift when our son was born. He is now 3 months old and unfortunately, he has not been able to really use it. If your crib has solid panels at the head and foot, the ties are not long enough to reach to the first slat on the side. I can't tie it to anything, so I won't leave it in for him to play with, as I am afraid it will fall on him. I have held it there for him to play with, and he loves to kick at it and watch the lights. So if your crib has slats at the head and foot, then go for it. But if you have solid panels, don't waste your money!",2.0
"Didn't last long, became entangled had to throw away!",2.0
It doesn't slink down our stairs.  Our 15 month old does enjoy playing with it but it doesn't work on either our hardwood or carpeted stairs.,2.0
The original slinky was large enough to go down stairs.  Yours is too small.,2.0
"My son is now 5 months old and has never shown any interest in this toy. Maybe part of the reason why is that it was hard for him to kick it hard enough or in the right spots to make it play enough? Either way, I took it out of his crib since he wasn't getting any use out of it. Maybe he'll like it to use on the floor when he's sitting up? We'll see.",2.0
"We bought this for our baby when he was about 5 months old. He is now 14 months old and has never kicked the piano in his crib, nor paid much attention to it otherwise. He likes to touch the lights and tries to get into it and see what's behind it, and that rather takes away from the buttons he's supposed to push to make the sounds. This toy was too expensive for my son to be so disinterested. Maybe he'll grow into it, but so far, he hasn't.",2.0
A little pricey for a babies toy. Offers about 15 minutes of attention each play time...get the picture parents.,2.0
"The toy is well made, the sound passable, and the idea great.  The problem is that my son, and the other infants that we have had visit, have not played with this toy much at all.",2.0
Came presharpend which is nice but some defective manufacturing slipped through as you can see in the photo,2.0
"We got this for our son when he was 6 mo old.  He's now 11 mo old and still isn't very interested in playing with it....maybe he will eventually.  Right now he will take the rings off, throw them, then moves on to something else.  It's not very entertaining for him (yet?).  I really liked the price though!! We'll see what happens.",2.0
"My son was given this as a gift when he was 4 months old -- we hung it up and thought he'd play with it and have fun since he loved the Sparkling Symphony but he never thought it was fun.  We even reintroduced it at a year and he was bored by it -- Sparkling Symphony is a much better toy this is a boring, not well designed toy.  Don't waste your money --",2.0
"I received these colored pencils today along with a coloring book to give as a gift. The pencil box was ripped opened, some of the pencils had fallen out of the box and they ended up laying on the bottom of the package. The worst thing is, the box is missing 5 of the pencils so I cant give this as a gift. Not happy.",2.0
"My little boy has had this toy since his birth - I tried it in his playpen, his crib, on the couch, on the floor, everywhere!  He didn't like it from the get go. Now he's 14 months old, and he still doesn't like to play with it.",2.0
"This toy was the least played-with toy in our house (had since birth of first child). Despite efforts to show them how to assemble it, it did not interest them. Go with sets of stacking cups, by far my kids' favorite until this day (fun in tub or playroom). My son did discover ultimately that the rocking stand for the donuts could be used as a hammer to hit his sister, then we finally got rid of this toy.",2.0
"I expected more from this toy.  The sound level, is too low.  It should have been made with an adjustable sound level.  The keys on the piano  should be more sensitive (on the entire key) not just a paricular spot.
I will be returning mine to the store today, I only bought it yesterday at a very high cost at that...",2.0
Got this for my baby when he was born. He's 9 months and still hasn't shown any interest in it. Have to apply a lot of pressure on the keys to get a sound out of them. He couldn't do it as an infant.,2.0
"I was very disappointed in this toy.  The idea is for the infant to lie on their back and kick at it to make noises sound and lights flash.  Unfortunately, since my infant -as well as another infant I take care of -could not see what they were kicking at, their kicking was never reinforced.  In addition, even when the toy was placed in the crib at the lowest possible position, I found that the infants kicks were higher, missing the keypads altogether.  Once the babies were mobile I removed it from the crib to let them play with it on the floor.  Even with my help the toy couldn't keep their attention for long.  I do have to admit, however, that my 1 year old enjoys walking on it now and again.  We're still trying...",2.0
The charger feels cheap I charged the batteries for 12 hrs on there first charge and I put them in my roku remote and it reads 76% so for some reason they didn't fully charge and the green light was on after the 12 hrs,2.0
Great selection of colors but have to press hard to make colors show on paper. Tossed out after repeated tries,2.0
"This is not the original size Slinky from when you were a kid.  It's a little smaller.  As has been posted in another review, it's simply too small to walk down standard stairs.  So what good it a slinky that doesn't go down stairs?  Good question.",2.0
Too small to walk the stairs,2.0
"For 50 pencils, you can't beat the price, but I don't like the shiny, waxy look.
I prefer a matte finish.
I'll order a different brand and see how it goes.
Apparently, some pencils are made with wax and some are made with oil.
So, these must be ""wax"" pencils.  Hopefully, I can find oil pencils.",2.0
"I'm a bit surprised by all the glowing reviews.  While the colors are great and the pencils themselves are sturdy and feel good in-hand, the tips break too easily, or at least our batch did during regular usage by my wife and sons on an ""expert level"" adult coloring book (i.e., these were not toddlers smashing the pencil points into the page during crude coloring sessions outside the lines).  Frustrating to have to continually sharpen and resharpen after each broken tip.  I hope your batch is better than ours.  Good luck!",2.0
"This product is just so-so. Makes popping sound but that's about. Won't hold interest for long.
Better spend a bit more for one of those poppers with funny heads going up and down when rolled over.
A more interesting sight.",2.0
i bought this to entertain my cats!  they are afraid of it. and it doesn't work on my size stairs.  So now I just place it in their toy box and they are fascinated with it.  I will keep it.,2.0
"survived 2 days, i really expected it to last a bit longer, no unusual force been applied, kids still like it, throw from hand to hand",2.0
This is a great toy for its price but verrrrrry annoying. It's very loud so I had to take it away from my kid.,2.0
"Not good on 11"" depth stairs. We stretched out the center of the slinky so it was usable on 11 inch treads. Still didn't work very well but was okay. Worked best on older New England house with narrow staircase.",2.0
"When I was a kid, my Slinky rolled and wondrously catapulted down the stairs.  This version is too small to perform this magic with consistency.  A big disappointment to my grandchildren!",2.0
My child was excited to watch the slinky walk down the stairs. That was the coolest thing about having a slinky in the 70's.  This slinky is smaller and shorter. It does NOT walk down the stairs. Big Disappointment.  NOT the original.,2.0
I do not think this is as big as the original slinky we had as kids.  It does not go down the stairs.  Perhaps there is a bigger one?,2.0
"Arrived in a ripped box, which is a bummer because I don't want to have to buy an alternate way of storing them.",2.0
"I wasn't expecting the wizards, ghouls and magical characters.  I suppose I didn't look close enough at the pictures to understand the characters.",2.0
"Yes, this slinky is much smaller & flimsier than the Slinky of decades ago. My 8 yr old had it for a day before it became unusable. Now she has it as a paperweight.",2.0
"I purchase two of these for my 5a dnd 6 year old granddaughters.  One had received a small plastic one at a party and my son
tried to show her how it worked,  but it didn't.  So, I found these on line and ordered two for their Easter baskets so they could see how they work,  but they really didn't do well at all.  Very disappointing!",2.0
Not the slinky I remember....it just doesn't want to do steps! I promised my granddaughter it would perform this task and we tried it on several different staircases...I guess slinky is getting too old (like me!),2.0
Broken hard leads,2.0
"I have ordered several different brands of pencils, but I ordered these because they had the names on them. I love the shades of these colors, but the lead breaks and comes out of the pencils after sharpening them. Several of my pencils are now half the size after sharpening them two or three times. I will not order these particular pencils again. I have some Loliz pencils that I love.",2.0
It doesn't work the way the ones did that I remember as a child. It goes down one step and stops. Very disappointing. Considered sending it back but  thought maybe it wasn't worth the hassle.,2.0
"Although it says ""original"", it is only 2.25 inches in Diameter.  It does NOT walk down stairs or on the floor.  So basically this is just an overpriced spring, all you can do is bounce it.",2.0

"I actually thought I was getting a slinky....the old fashioned metal kind.  I buy them every year and we enjoy a Christmas day slinky race down the stairs.  I actually got the slinky dog from Toy Story instead.  I'm not sure if I ordered wrong or it was sent wrong but I was disappointed.  I didn't have time before Christmas to look into it so I wrapped it and gave it to my daughter anyhow.  She was excited that it was a ""Toy Story"" toy as she loves the movie but it really hasn't been played with once and no slinky races this year.  :(",2.0
Diameter of coil is considerably smaller than the original Slinky. It didn't have as many coils on it as the original. It will not walk down stairs as advertised. It was cheaply made. I will never reccoment this product to a friend (or an enemy),2.0
"These pencils were moderately priced and I thought they would be a good buy.  I like the colors.  The pencils are hard to sharpen and all the greens have broken led.  These would be better for children, not adult coloring.  I'm sort of disappointed.",2.0
"It's a really well built toy and I remembered havin one as a child.  However, my son couldn't he cared less about it.  I bought it bc he loves to push just about anything.  This one not so much.  Plus, the ball popping noise is extremely loud.  Better off buying the bubble blowing lawn mower, a shopping cart, a toy baby stroller or any push/ride on toy instead.",2.0
"When I had one, the handle was a lot bigger and sturdy. I thought my baby would be able to balance on it as she walked. Now maybe you are saying ok this toy is for a toddler..I don't know seems like for younger children. My friends 2 year old wasn't interested. May be for some...but this was a disappointment for me.",2.0
"This slinky is lots smaller that what we remember from having these as a kid.
It will NOT go/walk down our stairs as the larger one would.
I waster my $$ on this item !!",2.0
"I had a Slinky when I was a kid many decades ago, and had lots of fun with it.  So I ran across this Original Slinky on Amazon and decided to order one for my grandson who seems to like simple toys over the modern fancy electronic toys and gadgets.  So the Slinky arrives and I open it and immediately notice it seems smaller than the one I had when I was 10.

Then I try to walk it down the stairs.  But it won't go down!  No matter what I do, it just makes it down measly one step before it stops dead.  What's wrong?  Am I Slinky-challenged?  I notice the Slinky's spring-iness just doesn't feel right (feels tighter than I remember).  I'm guessing the amount of spring has to be just right for it to work properly.  So maybe I got a cheap knock-off?

I wish I knew what happened to my old Slinky - that one was perfect!",2.0
"I purchased this slinky for my grandaughter, hoping it would be a close replica of the slinkies that I experienced in the 1960's. Those slinkies were about 5 inches in diameter which gave them the capability to ""walk"" down stairs and other larger objects. This slinky has a much smaller diameter which limits how much that can be done with it. Advertising it as the ""original"" slinky is misleading in my opinion.",2.0
"I bought this for my 13 month old to push around the house. I was disappointed when the wheels didn't turn on our hardwood floors. My daughter had to drag it across the floor. The items inside don't pop around unless the wheels are turning, so it wasn't much fun. I returned it.",2.0
My son had a plastic slinky before this one. It didn't last very long. I got the metal one thinking that it would. I was mistaken. In a matter of weeks he had managed to get this so tangled up that we had to bin it. It was impossible to get it untangled. The toy has no apparent educational value and the novelty of watching it 'walk' wears off after a few times. I would not purchase another slinky no matter how he bargains!,2.0
"I have a dwarf rabbit who loved his old plastic Slinky Jr.  He does not like the metal one, and I am hesitant to let him play with metal toys to begin with, but for some odd reason, Amazon would not give me free shipping on a plastic Slinky Jr., so I decided this would have to do.  Regular sized Slinkys are too big and heavy for him. :(",2.0
"When it said ""original slinky"", I assumed it would be full sized, but it wasn't. It was too small to ""walk"" down the stairs. It could only do 2-3 steps at the most.
  It was handled by a pretty gentle 6 year old, but still tangled and stretched out within days.
  So if you are looking to recreate the ""stair-walking slinly"", look for a bigger one.",2.0
"Wanted a cheaper version of Prismacolors since they have been getting bad ""cracking/splitting"" reviews lately.
Crayola pencils are denser and tougher than Berol Verithins so I had to press harder for color. And although they blend barely ok, they are waxier than Verithin. Nice array of colors, but not worth keeping if I want to color in my Enchanted Forest with any rich color and good blending. Returning after only 3 color usage and disappointment.",2.0
Great colors but a lot of them are too light. This box should also come with a pencil sharpener.,2.0
"The item arrived open box, just taped and without the bag for the chips, this is a great game but very disappointed that it did not arrived complete and since the first order never arrived I am not going to return it, but it was a bad experience.",2.0
I didn't get the bonus CD,2.0
I was pretty excited about getting this because of the theme. I was specifically looking for a game for 8 characters. I was pretty disappointed when I received it and 2 of the characters are non-suspects. I think that should be clear on the description before someone purchases it. Just a thought. I can't use this game now.,2.0
The noise it makes would drive me insane and I dearly love the family I forced it onto.  They have actually never been really grateful for it and I do not blame them!,2.0
Original toy.  Slow to arrive.  Item was 2.99 but shipping was 4.49.  What a rip off.,2.0
"Pencils are nice, but the condition upon arrival was horrendous.",2.0
We played this for New Year's Eve.  It was fun until we got to the end and found out who the murderer was.  There was no way of finding out ourselves.  It was a convoluted ending.  Very disappointing.  This is our 3rd year doing this and only 1 of 3 games were we able to actually figure out the murderer ourselves.,2.0
"This is made of super-cheap and flimsy plastic - the old ones were much more durable. The plastic wheels get very little traction, so the popping mechanism doesn't work well. I guess the $14 price makes it essentially disposable, but I'd willingly pay twice as much for something more solidly made.",2.0
"My son loves to push objects, anything and everything which is why i always wanted to buy him a push toy. This is nice except that it makes too much noise and sometimes my son gets scared of it. The noise also is a little disturbing to the ears. If your baby loves a push toy too, get something that is not noisy.",2.0
these break so much! My Sargent art is way better than Caryola any more! will not buy these again!,2.0
wish it was a better made set  pieces small and cheap,2.0
"This is my first murder mystery (as well as all of my guests first) and we had a lot of fun. We will definitely have another murder mystery but I don't plan on buying it from the same company. As others have wrote try not to have 8 people, as it complicates the game. Maybe our group wasn't paying enough attention, but people kept missing their opportunity to ask questions and their was no guide on who should ask who in an exact order. The storyline was very humorous, and as I've said we had fun, but if you are thinking about buying this product I may try to find another one if your group can get off topic.",2.0
"I don't know if it is the fault of this product, but my toddler didn't seem to like it or find it interesting at all. She basically ignored any attempts to get her to play with it.",2.0
"These are fine as a kid, but the pigmentation is light and the colors aren't vivid and don't cover the page the way Prismacolor pencils do.  While these are a great price, they're probably not what you're looking for if you're in the market for pencils to use in your adult coloring books.  (Also, the more mature-looking box design of  ""Crayola Colored Pencils, 50 Count, Vibrant Colors, Pre-sharpened, Art Tools, great for Adult Coloring"" are just a more expensive package of the same colored pencils - I didn't notice any difference except price.)",2.0
"From other reviews, we thought this game would be fun to play as a couple in our mid 20's. However, this was definitely not the case. I am very quick with puzzles and mazes and was thoroughly bored by this game, and while my husband is very smart, puzzles are not his strongest area and he had to concentrate for a long time over each move, but if he took enough time then our abilities were pretty evenly matched. The way this game played out, we spent most of the time sitting in silence, not wanting to disturb the other player while they concentrated, and we ended up essentially tying by finding all of our treasures in the same number of moves. Neither of us were impressed. We prefer games that require interaction, strategy that goes beyond one turn, and a little bit of luck. This game didn't tick any of those boxes. Additionally, we often found that the process of pushing the tiles around the board caused them to get stuck and required finesse to get them to slide appropriately, and I can easily imagine younger players having a more difficult time than we did. The only positive that I saw was that the tiles and game board were very sturdily made, and the design was cute.",2.0
One of the rummy tiles in the game set had a residue of paint so I am now needing to write or call the Consumer Service department to determine how to get this resolved.  When purchasing Rummikub I would inspect the tiles and get back to the Pressman Toy Corporation if you have similar complaints.  My opponents all know that the bad tile is a number 12.  I am sad consumer and I love to play this game !,2.0
box came damaged,2.0
"mine came PINK, no good for 8 yr old grandson",2.0
"They are all broken inside...

Like, when I sharpen them, they just fall apart. The colored ""lead"" in them have all but shattered. No matter how much or how little I sharpen them, they just fall out when I try to use them after sharpening. They lasted about 15% of the length of the colored pencil before the leads started falling out.",2.0
"No me gusto que el juguete vino rayado, con golpes en la circunferencia plastica transparente, como si hubiese sido usado o hubiese estado en exhibicion en la tienda.",2.0
This slinky won't even 'walk' down stairs...i guess bc its plastic...,2.0
"Doesn't work like the metal ones, stops several time down the stairs.",2.0
I bought this for my 10 month old.  He walks very well on his own already. He was excited when he heard the popping noise as I pushed it around and showed him how it works but for some reason he can't maneuver this toy by himself very well.  Even at 11 months he's not able to do it although he walks perfectly on his own. I think it's because the handle is so narrow and the toy is light weight.  Also on hardwood floors the wheels don't grip so it doesn't pop but rather just drags across the floor.  I would take this back to the store if i could.,2.0
Broken and falling out of the box!,2.0
"The description of this product is incorrect.  It states the slinky is 3.9 X 3-8 inches, when in fact it is 3 1/16 X 2 3/8 inches.  The model number (110) is the same as one I purchased about 5 years ago, but the one I already have is 4 inches by 4 inches.  I wanted the larger size, as that is what my grandson requested.  It was very disappointing to receive something that was not as described on the website.

Unhappy in Maryland",2.0
The colors are very weak and you don't get much color an the page .,2.0
"The plastic Slinkys are a piece of junk compared to the metal ones, but the plastic ones are better for very young children.",2.0
I love this game. We've played with with friends many times. What I didn't love was that the package had been opened and used. I would have been so embarrassed had I purchased it for gift. The bag of tiles had been neatly cut open along the side of the bag. The tiles were all over in the box. It seems most games come sealed in cellophane. This game had two small adhesive circles adhering the box closed. Disappointed.,2.0
Box was heavily damaged. Was going to give this as a gift alongside a coloring book. Looks like I'm going to Walmart instead.,2.0
Colored pencil box was ripped. Not looking forward to giving this as the gift it was intended to be.,2.0
"I bought this for my 16 month old son -- because it is a classic.  I bought a similar toy for my nephew a few years ago and he loved it - made my sister nuts with it.  But - unfortunately - this has been a bust.  My son LOVED it and immediately started pushing it wildly around the house. But - no popping sound.  I thought maybe he just wasn't putting enough pressure on it (which would have been annoying since he is 16 months old and this is supposedly for toddlers) but that was not the issue. I couldn't get the balls to ""pop"" either. If I used it on one rug of our house - the wheels rolled and the balls popped. But, on most rugs and on all of our hardwood floors (90% of our house), the wheels don't roll.  The toy just glides across the floors, but with no rolling motion, the balls don't ""pop"".  Needless to say, I will be returning.  I definitely don't recommend if you have hardwood or tile floors in your play area --- the toy won't work, you'll be annoyed, and your child will be frustrated!",2.0
The pencil case had been opened before and taped back. Disappointed.,2.0
"Super light - all plastic of course.  Sometimes the wheels don't turn on our hardwood floors which mean the corn doesn't pop.

Does not arrive in retail box.  Open the shipping box and there it is.

Think twice - it's noisy.  We don't let him have it every day. :)",2.0
not very good,2.0
Received this as a gift and the animals were so small it became a choking hazard. I wound up not even letting my six month old play with the toy and eventually threw it away when my eldest lost all the animals. Now that I see how expensive the toys was.,2.0
The colored pencils look like the average crayola product. However these colored pencils are part of a gift and the box is ripped.so the color pencils were all over the place.kinda annoying.,2.0
"Ordered two and one box was all ripped up, not usually a problem but I had ordered them as gifts. :(",2.0
"Love this toy, but falling apart, lots of strings coming loose and this was right out of the box.",2.0
"I don't care for these colored pencils.  The leads are very hard, and it's difficult to color with them.  It takes so much pressure to get an adequate lay down of color, that the entire coloring page warps.  I know they are verithin, and verithin pencil leads are hard, but these seem to be much harder than other brands.",2.0
"I actually rarely write reviews, but I must say the actual game box itself is really thrashed up... I'm hoping this is a new game...",2.0
"My brother got this toy one year when he was 5 and I was 8. It was so annoying, I grabbed it away from him one day and proceeded to bash him repeatedly on the head until my Mother took me over her lap and proceeded to give me a good old fashioned spanking. My brother was ok aside from some bruises and an intense fear of popping sounds. To this day you can NOT pop Popcorn around him without setting off a panic attack.",2.0
These do not sharpen well.  They break constantly and the 'lead' just falls out of the pencil.,2.0
"By far my favorite game. There is not a single family gathering without rummikub being played. 5 stars all the way... however... this version sucks! The original tiles were impressed with the number and were colored black, red, yellow, and blue. Super easy to read. This version of the game replaced the black tiles with orange and the numbers are no longer set into the tiles.  The numbers are just painted on. It is too difficult to tell the difference between the yellow,  red, and orange tiles and they feel cheap!

Spend the extra $30 and the old 1990's version of the game if you can find it. This new version is practically impossible to play with.",2.0
"I purchased this game to replace an old, worn-out version (numbers worn off due to heavy use -- my Dad loves this game). I was very disappointed with the quality of the new game; specifically, the numbering on the tiles. After only a few months of use the numbers are already wearing off. On some of the tiles the numbers are so worn that they are unreadable -- this is after only a few months of play.  Step-mom emailed the company and received no reply.",2.0
"We got the popper that counts to 10, as a gift for our now, 3 year old. She didn't use it that much, but the counting was annoying and then stopped completely (not a bad thing). Sometimes the popper part worked and sometimes it didn't. It was really frustrating, so we put it in the trash.

I won't be getting one for our second daughter.",2.0
poor quality...,2.0
"This package was delivered to me today, but the condition of the product is so obviously not new! The corners of the box of the game are so worn and already falling apart. I feel like I've been totally taken advantage of in buying this. I'm disappointed in Amazon for the product quality.",2.0
The blue and black are the only colors not fading. Had thiis trouble before and I guess its because its made in China. Called the company and they said to mark the faded ones with a color pen  WTF  Wont buy it again,2.0
"For the most part, this toy just sits in the corner of my kids play room collecting dust.  My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday.  She is now three. She has played with it maybe a dozen times in all that time.",2.0
"I was actually fairly dissapointed in the quality of these colored pencils. Nearly half of the pack had broken leads inside. They were sharpened nicely and I'd color, then when I sharpen it, it just breaks. I've only had this happen with cheap colored pencils which is why I ordered the crayola ones. Won't order again. :(",2.0
"Okay... This game makes you think which is great BUT it is all in the luck of the draw.  It is not the best strategy that wins. I have 12 year old triplets who were bored mid-way through the very first game we played. I don't know what I am missing here because the reviews are great. But I do not get it!!!  If you have a great mind this is not the game for you. If you are looking for something ""fun"" to play with your kids this is not the game for you. Honestly, I do not know who this game is for. I gave it two stars only because the ""idea"" of the game is imaginative.",2.0
"Not the best, Break Easily, hard",2.0
"A lot meaning a good portion of the pencils are bent. They don't lay flat. Yup they're curved. Not sure why. But they still work. And, I can tell them apart from my daughters lol",2.0
"It was not the best, the box came all ripped up and broken, but luckily there WAS 50 colored pencils in the box..",2.0
"While I am sure this game is good, it came to me with two game pieces missing and one of the cards is missing as well. I cannot let my students play this as it is.",2.0
"We gave this to our 7 year old daughter for her birthday and it was quite a disappointment.  We had to order it 3 times.  Each time it arrived, the sparkley dirt was open and spilled all over the entire project.  The third time we ordered we decided to keep the item and deal with the spilled dirt.  When she finally opened it to start the project there was a chip in the planter and the planter was really cheap and thin.  Would certainly not recommend this product to anyone.",2.0
"I bought this for my daughter who was 7 at the time.  She loved the idea and painting the dish.  Downside was that the bowl is so small you can't see too much design when your child is done painting.

After everything was arranged just so in the pot, it took about a week before the do-dads and extras started to get moldy.  Watching grass grow isn't that exciting either.  Flowers would have been more interesting.

Tip for anyone who buys this - DON'T put the extra decorations in until after the grass and bean sprouts have grown.",2.0
"It was fun setting it up but it actually got MOLDY! e[...] I think it's because it's a closed container or my daughter just got carried away with watering?  Anyway, it got gross pretty fast :(",2.0
The box came open in the mail and all the pencils were loose and one is missing.,2.0
"I was hoping for the large print tiles, and the numbers are even smaller than normal. Not worth the money.",2.0
Much too flimsy...tiles continuously fall off the holders...child 8 years old became frustrated with it...I would not order it again,2.0
A lot of the pencils had broken led so when sharpened it would just fall out then have to sharpen more,2.0
"I couldn't use the game because the colors are not distinct enough of each other, especially the blue. I had to give it away",2.0
"I purchased this game for a neighbor because I have enjoyed my game for years.  However, the quality of this game is not as good as my game.  The paint on the numbers is easily scratched and not holding up.  I have never had that problem with my older version of this game.  It's a shame that the quality has deteriorated from then to now.",2.0
"One of the biggest problems with this game is the instructions. I have a lot of board games and this is worst than Monopoly's. I still don't know how to add up points and me and my wife read the directions a thousand times. You have to ASSSSUUUUME. Blah.

The game play it's self lags too because you have to TALLY. It's pretty annoying having to write points down every 30 seconds.

I would say this is one of the worst games I have ever played.

Between horrible instructions and tallying this just can't be fun.

Now the actual game is fun, not super fun but it's fine. It's just the other things get in the way.

I would only suggest this to 1. Anal Retentive people. 2. People who love math. 3. People who love Rummy and are out of things to do.",2.0
Ok nothing special,2.0
"Not overly impressed with how well they color in the adult coloring books that I ordered.  just don't put a lot of bright color down on the page, I guess you get what you pay for. I would try a more expensive  brand next time I order.",2.0
"These seem like they'd be awesome, but the colors are very light no matter how hard you press them down. There are much better options.",2.0
"Each colored pencil is low quality, and that disappoints me.",2.0
"The lead breaks a lot with these, a real pain.",2.0
Colored pencils do not want to lay color down. Contain too much wax or other material.,2.0
The crayons pack was ripped. Noticed some of the pencils were used..,2.0
I didn't like the way these pencils colored. I color adult coloring books but these pencils made me feel like I was in kindergarten again. I prefer ohuhu pencils.,2.0
"This is the first time I have used any colored pencils and they are not what I expected at all. On the box it states bold,bright colors. Not in the box I purchased were there any such things. The pencils looked like they were going to be but they were pale. You could make them look a little darker on some but would need to bear down too hard,thought my fingers were going to break. Many of the pencils were bent, not broken to begin with. Quality poor, price good for the amount you get. l will shop for a different kind.",2.0
"As an avid adult coloring book user, these pencils are kind of bottom of the line. They get dull very quickly and when you go to sharpen them, forget about using an electric sharpener- they get eaten up really quickly. Once sharp, the tip inevitably breaks off like butter, which requires more sharpening, which leaves you with much less pencil. I've sprung for the more expensive, higher quality pencils, which work better. For kids, however, I'd go with these.",2.0
"I'm an Etch A Sketch enthusiast (stop laughing). ""Pocket"" used to be my favorite size, but as of around September 2012 the design has gotten smaller. Instead of 4.25"" x 3.75"" (2.75"" x 2"" drawing area), it is now 3.75"" by 3.25"" (2.25"" x 1.5"" drawing area). This makes it far less usable and doesn't really make it any more portable, since it's still 1.5"" thick. I'm really, really unhappy with this change, but I suppose that's mostly my preference. I will probably need to use ""travel"" size now.

The main problem is that the current image and dimensions on the product page here are misleading. I'll try to add a picture showing the relative sizes.

It is worth noting that drawing and erasing seem to work just fine.",2.0
"I liked this game when we first received it, but was worried about the suction cup design not working well. To my surprise, it actually did work the first time we played it, and pretty well at that. But the second time we pulled it out, the suction cup had deformed a little bit and no longer worked properly. It had been put back in the box but maybe got a little bent as a kid put it in there for storage. It took a very minor amount of damage through typical use to no longer work at all.",2.0
Not too thrilled with the color this puts down in adult coloring books. Plus they tend to break with sharpening. Color is not very good. Would not buy for my purposes.,2.0
"I bought this game for nephew who is eight.  It has a lot of pieces and a lot of colors, which makes it fun for a kid.  The game is really kind of boring and the labrynth tiles are hard to slide.",2.0
The pencils color to lightly.,2.0
My son is really into fishing and wanted a game like that so my mom brought it home for him. My mom is a preschool special education teacher and had this game at her work but didn't need it so gave it to my son. The suction cup piece is a little annoying and my son doesn't really enjoy playing it because there are so many ways to play it. He has more fun just picking them up cause the suction cup is really weak. Could be better.,2.0
This was what I was looking for but when you shake to erase all it does is make the screen grainy and does not fully clear.,2.0
"Pros- cute size

Cons- Cheaply made and came open with dirty tape holding it together.",2.0
"Thought it was red, received a pink one for my son",2.0
"They need to revise this game - the idea is good, but the suction cup ruins all the fun! It is hard to catch any fish on that cup, which is also very small. We had to moisten the darn thing to get anything stuck on it, and even then it takes some pressure to get a fish hooked. Returning it back to the store.",2.0
Way too tiny.  My pocket is a bit bigger than this,2.0
This is a flimsy toy and not worth the money.  It's only slightly entertaining.,2.0
too small,2.0
too small!!,2.0
Does not erase well,2.0
Way too small. Thought it was much bigger.,2.0
I ordered 2 of these as stocking stuffers for my daughters. One of them stopped working for no discernible reason less than an hour after using it.,2.0
He really did not take to this one.  It was a lot smaller than I thought.  I think i am going to return it,2.0
"I wanted a pink one like is advertised, and not the green one they sent. Also, it is smaller than the one we are replacing, even though both are supposed to be the ""pocket"" version.",2.0
I bought this to replace a Pocket Etch A Sketch like the one shown in the picture. The one I received is MUCH smaller.,2.0
Not a fair amount of color options in each color shade. Lots of greens and the rest random and some are rich in color and some are terrible.. I'd invest in better ones. These are great for kids but not my adult coloring.,2.0
Overpriced for being a travel size. Not overly impressed with the product but will do for the gag gift it is intended for.,2.0
"These Pencils FADE and so do the other two brands I use........even the ones that are twice as much in cost.
Could it be that the Paper has a lot of ACID in it?",2.0
like it!,2.0
Pencils keep breaking when I sharpen,2.0
"I received my pencils.  But when I got them the tops were broken off. They had come out of the box. I thought they would still be okay, but now as I started using them I can only color a little before I have to sharpen them because the lead keeps falling out or breaking. It is like the lead is broken all the way up the pencils and almost all of them are the same.  I bought a new set of a different brand. Would not purchase these again.  I just started trying to use them in the last month. Thought they'd be okay but their not. Cost to much for such  bad set.",2.0
Seems very waxy,2.0
"The product itself was great, just as Crayola products usually are, but I can not give this product more than 2 stars as it arrived with 11 missing colors (that's almost 25%!) and 15 multiples. In total I received 54 pencils, not 50, but just not the right ones.

Colors I have multiples of: red orange, orange, mango, golden yellow, lime green, yellow green, light blue, navy blue, orchid, light brown, brown, taupe, silver, gray, and cool gray
Colors I did not receive at all: raspberry, maroon, red, teal, cerulean, mauve, pale rose, magenta, bubblegum, sand, and gold

Pretty disappointed with this particular seller sending a bunch of standard colors and expecting buyers not to notice a quarter of the colors missing.",2.0
"These were purchased for use with an adult coloring book and when compared with the higher end pencils, there is no comparison. These lose and are best left to the kids.  They color, but they do not have a soft core and to make the colors vibrant, you have to press hard which distorts the picture. The colors actually went through the page of the coloring book, I pressed so hard.",2.0
The book is really a cute idea but when I opened the package the book smelled bad like it had been somewhere damp for a long time. The little bear has a tag to press the tummy so it must make some kind of sound but it didn't work. I returned the book.,2.0
I was very disappointed when this item was received. The pieces are too small to be manipulated by little fingers and also will be easily lost. It is expensive for what it is--especially since it won't work as intended. I should have gotten the teddy bear with better manipulatives!,2.0
"Got this book as a gift for my son and although it's cute, he has zero interest in it. My son LOVES books and can't get enough of them but he has never liked activity books at all and this one in particular is very boring. The price tag is a joke, I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I would pass on this unless your child is VERY interested in activity books (there are a couple of flaps to lift and that's pretty much it).",2.0
These are no great shakes. My dollar store pencils actually work better,2.0
"As a teacher of over 20 years, I can attest that the quality of these has gone down hill in the last few years.  The leads slide out of the wood after they are sharpened, they break easily, and the wood grain is so rough that even a high quality sharpener has a hard time doing the job.  There are others that are worse quality, but not that much worse, and they are cheaper.  These used to be what I suggested for kids to buy on the supply list.  Now I can't suggest them.  Sorry Crayola...you need some better quality control!",2.0

Used it for colouring. Not as effective. Doesn't stay sharp long. Constantly having to sharpen. Glad there are lots of choices tho. But would probably prefer the mechanical ones if same quality.,2.0
I ordered these because I bought some adult coloring books. The package itself came torn from top to bottom. Some of the pencils tips were broken as well. Next time I think I'll just go to the store.,2.0
Half my pencils when sharpened broke down to the last three inches of the pencils,2.0
have to lean on paper to get color it almost breaks the pencil,2.0
"Ordered these pencils for my mother-in-law along with an adult coloring book.
Glad I decided to try the pencils out before I gave them to her.
They are NOT good quality.  Do not shade well and the colors look bad.
I ended up ordering her the US Art Supply 50 Piece Artist Grade High Quality Colored Pencil Set, Full Size 7 Inch Length * Now Includes a FREE Reusable Plastic Carry Case on Amazon.
I'm sure she will be much happier with her new set.
Would only recommend the crayola pencils for the younger crowd. (maybe)",2.0
"We got this toy for my son, Tyler, when he was 9 months old. We already had a similar table & thought this looked like fun because of the blocks.  I liked that the table top flipped over to reveal a big tub to put the blocks or other toys in - & it's VERY sturdy ! Tyler loved to sit inside & look out the window.  Other than that - hmmmmm - not much to write about.  I think it would be better if it had more buttons to push that would light up & play music to keep a toddler's interest.  This only has buttons that squeak & little wheels to roll.  We weren't very impressed.",2.0
"I bought this for my son when he became more interested in toys he could play with standing up than sitting down. He has never really enjoyed it, even after 6+ months. The thing with the balls in it has never really worked (I don't know, maybe ours in broken), and the other activities on it just bore him. At first he liked putting the blocks down the chute on the side, but that got old quick. And the blocks don't stay together like Legos do, so he doesn't even have much fun with those anymore. It's too hard for a child to switch the table top over. Now he just takes it off and sits in the table. (He actually does this so often now that it almost made this purchase worthwhile). I'll say one good thing about this table, it is made well. My son is very big for his age and he sits in it without it bending. We ended up getting him a Playskool table that he loves. With all the really interesting activity tables out there, I'm surprised this one is still on the market. I guess they hope people like me who don't know the difference buy it...",2.0
"This toy doesn't rate high with me. It was given to my son a long time ago. With all of the new tables out there, I am surprised this one is still on the market. It has it's own interlocking blocks set, which is a big mess in my opinion. Kids can't flip the top to put other (lego like) blocks on it also, because they don't fit. There is a storage for the blocks that this comes with, but it still doesn't house them well enough for me. My kids played with this when it was first introduced, but it was just a large toy that gets in the way. If you are going for simplistic, then this is the toy for you. But, with all the bells and whistles that are out there, in my opinion, this one takes up too much space and too little interest.",2.0
"My husband and I bought this for our 9 month old twin daughters. We were confident as we have lots of Fisher Price gear in the house. Well this toy is so dangerous I feel like it should be recalled. My daughters are both walking and this toy slides all over the place, so naturally they push it around the house. Well it's not very sturdy so when they sit down in front of it to play it's very easily pulled over and the table top pops out. It has tipped over and hit both of my daughters in the face and one of daughters has gotten a bloody nose, and has cut her lip when the table hit her face and her lip was cut with her top teeth. I have contacted Fisher Price and they offered a refund, but I feel like all buyers she know about this potential for injury.",2.0
"I wanted this so bad for my daughter on her first christmas.  My MIL got it for her and she's 2 now and I bet she's actually ""played"" w/it once.  It's mostly been used to sit in.  The top w/the play items has always been tossed to the side so she can climb in.  She'll play with the activites for about 2 minutes.  It's now being used as a table for her dollhouse.  I noticed my friend had one for her daughter (now 15 mos) and the top was off it too.  I asked if she played w/it and she said no, just sits in it.  So, I would spend your $ elsewhere.",2.0
"My son is 8 months old and looking for things to pull himself up on all the time, so I bought him this table as the solution.  The problem is the table is not weighted enough to support an infant pulling himself up and it slides around.  Once he was successfully standing in front of the table he was too tall for it, so because he was hunching over to play with the toys he decided to sit back down and play with it that way.  This table isn't what it's cracked to be as far as infants playing with the table (for a better solution see my review of FP Crawl n Cruise) but it may be just right for toddlers to sit in front of and use as a stacking table.",2.0
"I was disappointed in the quality of color, not as deep as I would like.  Also difficult to get a really fine line with these. On the other hand, there is a good variety of colors for the price.  Wish they were shaped like the prismacolor brand rather than round so that they would not roll away when you set them down",2.0
"I bought 3 boxes of these.  Crayola Pencils are always great.  These arrived in poor condition. It's not worth it to return them.  I buy from Amazon all the time, and this is a huge disappointment.",2.0
The lead breaks too easily when sharpening!!! One color after using it one time in one sitting is over halfway gone! Each time I had to sharpen it the lead broke each time. This happened on many of the others as well. I won't buy this again. I was very surprised as I considered Crayola a quality brand.,2.0
Color additives too weak.  Difficult to get solid color.,2.0
I just received my order out of the 50 pencils only got 31. Very disappointed in this order.,2.0
I'm not sure it is new or used one. The case seems to be used one,2.0
"The concept of a zip up, fabric, almost puzzle-like alphabet book is great.  But, there are so many pieces to loose.  They will replace the pieces, but it is still a hassle.  Definitely for age 3 and up.",2.0
"I like the product, but you can get them for nearly half the price through other merchants.",2.0
The animals had very poor detail--it was hard to identify some with what they were labeled to be.,2.0
Overpriced and animals are very strange looking. My son has zero interest in this toy after looking at it for 5min,2.0
"cRAYONS WERE VERY HARD, ALMOST TORE THE PAPER AND DID NOT REALLY SHOW TRUE COLOURS, LOOKED DISTRESSED, FADED ON PAPER, SO BOUGHT NEW MARKERS TO TRY INSTEAD!  REALLY DISAPPOINTED!",2.0
I ordered the one with silver and gold pencils and I got normal ones,2.0
"I really wanted to like this book. We have some other Pockets of Learning items that are great. However, the animals here at times do not even resemble what they are supposed to. Most resemble the animal somewhat, but still a stretch. A toddler may not be able to identify what many of the animals are supposed to be, defeating the purpose. The fabric colors look dull. I feel bad saying the quality is cheap, because they are all handmade I believe and with all the embroidery look like they take a while to make, but they really don't look that nice at all. Also, the letters on the back of the animals are slim and in white, and the fabric for many of the animals is light in color, making the letters very hard to see at times, especially for a toddler to notice. This one by Alma's Designs seems to be made a little better:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ABC-Train-Travel-Bag/dp/B00080FIGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ABC Train Travel Bag</a>

And FYI, many reviewers commented that their baby loves it, but it is really not a safe baby toy. The animals are relatively small and a baby could stuff the whole thing in its mouth, so supervise carefully.",2.0
Wood is very soft and hard to sharpen. The colored pencil part brakes off very east while trying to sharp. I have to sharpen all the pencils for my kids. Even I struggle to get them sharp again. Several pencils were bent when arrived.,2.0
"I think you get what you pay for, these were very inexpensive.  They are kind of hard to color with since the color bleeds through the page and doesn't saturate the paper evenly.  I like to do some adult-coloring at work and I will be passing these to my toddler and moving on to other kinds of markers.",2.0
Not good for anything you need a fine or narrow tip marker for. The tips are too wide. They seem like the generic markers versus Crayola with the materials used.,2.0
"My wife was all excited to get this toy for my 3 yr old but he didn't have much fun with it.  I think they thought it was going to ""behave"" like the character in the movie.  Kids really did not play with him much and I believe he was in two pieces the last time I saw him.  Sorry slinky dog!",2.0
I got these for my adult coloring books and I'm not a fan.  The colors are not that vibrant.  And a couple of them are already running out after I've done one page. I think I'll just give them to my kids.,2.0
Needed these for Christmas gifts but they arrived late and are not eligible for return. Markers are ok.,2.0
"Color pencil box was opened, colored pencils were spread everywhere in my shipment box and a lot were broken",2.0
Ruined within days,2.0
This is wayyyyyy smaller than suggested. You r better off going to walmart and getting a bigger one for the same price. A child cannot pull this behind themself. The string is just a few inches long. I doubt even a 1 year old could do so.,2.0
I bought these for my classroom so there are many different students using these. The tops need to be aligned perfectly or it will press down on the tip and push it back so the marker can't be used. They were cheap enough but I will not buy then again since they are it durable enough.,2.0
"Very disappointing. Not only was the string too short, it would not even stand up or walk without falling over. I bought it for one of my granddaughters for her birthday and even a 3 year old was disappointed.",2.0
Looks bigger in the picture...,2.0
Really small.  Item not as pictured.,2.0
"It is different from the image of the girl carrying the dog, that dog is bigger but the dog that will sell you is too small, about 10cm or so, I consider misleading advertising",2.0
"I bought it for my 8 year old she loved it then my 3 year old son got his hands on it and that was that.
Slinkys don't stand a chance with the little ones.",2.0
These are very streaky and translucent.  They do not have the opacity and saturated look I like in a marker but they do not bleed through.,2.0
"Bought these for the plastic cover, unfortunately they came in a cardboard one. :( If you are buying these for the pens alone, they are fine but I was searching everywhere for a plastic covered one and was so excited to see this only to be sad when they were not what was advertised.",2.0
"I was fairly excited when I found these at my local 'more-than-a-dollar' store. I've been working on lettering with markers (Tombows and Copics all the way down to the standard Crayola markers). So here was something I'd never come across in person and I was more than willing to cough up a little cash to try these out.

Unfortunately, my enthusiasm petered out as soon as I opened them. They are definitely manufactured on the cheap and some corners were cut. (Plain white cheap-looking barrel, caps not as secure as any other Crayola marker I've tried.) Still, I hoped for the best and spent several minutes practicing with them.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these whatsoever for 'brush' lettering. I do not understand at all what makes these special, they seem flimsy to me and I'm afraid the tip of the marker will pop right off.  I vastly prefer the chubby Crayola markers for lettering and coloring. Save yourself a little money if you're into lettering (or coloring) and move right along.",2.0
This toy is significantly smaller than I assumed. The picture they show with the child walking Slinky Dog is extremely misleading. It's a little more than just a pocket sized toy.,2.0
"It was not big enough. The string was too short.
Grandkids probably didn't play with it much.
I wouldn't purchase this in hindsight.",2.0
I don't think they wrote very clearly. I haven't used them after the first time. I am sure they are fine for kids,2.0
Oredered 2 and boxes were torn,2.0
I teach first grade and my kiddos ran the markers dry within a week.  I would use them for upper grades and just spend the extra money on the bigger but more expensive (fewer) crayola markers for the lower grades.,2.0
"I bought this toy as a gift for my five years old nephew, but after twice that he stretched the dog, it never returned to the original shape. I think the dog is okay if you don't want to play with it.",2.0
These colored pencils are not that great.  There are many colors that fall apart when sharpening them.  I had one pencil's tip fall off when sharpened till it was down to a nub. I didn't even get a chance to use it.  Guess I will be buying prismacolor from now on!,2.0
"These markers were a disappointing purchase. The tips were not fine enough to control coverage and they dry out quickly. While there are 20 markers, there are only about 15 unique colors. The different shades in the color families all apply as the same color, so there aren't light and dark purples, blues, and browns.",2.0
The pics show a child pulling dog behind them. Very unlikely it is small perfect for the hands of a toddler to hold. I got it for my son for christmas he has not recieved it yet. I think he will like it but not as much as he would have had it truly been the size of pic. He is almost 6 and loves the slinky dog.,2.0
"This was SO SO much smaller than I expected.  The one picture of the girl pulling the dog behind her is nothing short of deception!  The dogs string is about 4 inches long...definitely not long enough for my 37 inch child to pull while walking! It doesn't stand up, which leads to frustration for my 3 year old.  I mean its a cute toy if you want a cheap ""slink"" to join your Toy Story Collection.  I wish I would have went for the more pricey one! I am sure it wouldn't of been so small and useless other than decoration!",2.0
This toy is useless.  The cord is so short you can't pull it behind you.  It is placed in a weird spot on the dogs head.  The plastic is very cheap too.  If you want to collect all the toy story toys and leave them on the self this would be fine but if your giving it to kids don't bother.,2.0
"I bought this as a beginner set as I didn't know how involved I'd get in coloring the wonderful coloring books I've been buying through Amazon.  I was fairly happy until I needed to start sharpening them and now I am not. Impossible to get a lead that lasts more than a minute of coloring. This is s severe problem as there is little depth to the colors so in order to get it dark, you need to press hard and use many strokes. Needless to say, extremely frustrating!!!!  I bought my set from Hobby Lobby with a birthday gift certificate so at least I am not out CASH wise. Color assortment is not great. 2 shades of red? Now that I am hooked, I will need to get a much better quality, assortment of pencils.",2.0
These are bleeding through my pictures & has ruined several pages as well as the other 2 items I have reviewed.,2.0
Slinky is one of the most wanted characters from Toy Story. He is cute and unique and our 4 year old was so pleased to receive him. He stretches out and doesn't contract very well but he does complete the character set.,2.0
The box that holds the pencils was a little damaged,2.0
"My granddaughter loved it at first until the slinky part got bent.  It wouldn't  ""walk"" far without falling over before it got bent.  I don't think it's an educational toy.",2.0
"I received this slinkly dog for my four year old daughter.  Although she loooves Toy Story I found this dog to be extremely small.  Just a little bigger than a barbie doll, in my opinion.  I have not given it to her yet for Christmas and even though I know she will love it - -my impression is that it is too small.",2.0
"WAY OVERPRICED for what it is. I piece of plastic with electrical conduit going thru to reinforce the handle and 35' of steel cable and plastic wheels. Way, way too much money for what it is. Have not installed it yet, considering our options.",2.0
"When I initially reviewed this product, my review was rejected because I critiqued the product with little emphasis on customer service.  As far as customer service goes, the company did a satisfactory job of filling the order, to include offering to refund 50% of the purchase price based on my disatisfaction with the product.  The product itself is cheaply made and is not suitable for use as a zip line.  In reality, it is supposed to be mounted perfectly horizontal and low enough so that the child's feet remain in contact with the ground.  There was virtually no metal used in it's construction.  Personally, I didn't feel comfortable allowing my 9 year old grandson using this toy.",2.0
"Purchased 2 years ago for my three young boys (3, 6, 9), now it's non-functional because the plastic pulleys on the inside are completely chewed up by the metal cable.  Cable has also done a number on the plastic housing, grinding a much larger slot on both sides where the cable runs thru.  At one year, also had to hit the hardware store for better and stronger cable clamps to keep things taut.  After first installing, the kids used it and had lots of fun, but it's not really made to handle much weight or frequent use.  If you have active kids, better to pay extra for something else with a metal housing and pulleys.",2.0
"We returned this game. Got it for our 2 year old's birthday because she loves stacking stuff. I found that the pegs were a very snug fit and she had too much trouble fitting the pegs into one another. Frankly, I also had a hard time fitting the pegs in.",2.0
"the pegs fit much too tightly for little ones to be able to even use it, and the older ones who could fit them together got bored of this 'baby toy' quickly. also the base is made of soft plastic and doesn't lie flat. not well designed or thought out at all.",2.0
The toy has a bad chemical smell to it,2.0
"They break when you sharpen them.  If you are lucky to get a point, it breaks off.  Would not buy them again.",2.0
markers run out of ink kind of quickly,2.0
I would not buy these again. The tips are not of good quality and do not stay together well.,2.0
"Ugh.  My pencils came with the box open all all the pencils spilled out in the shipping box.  Most of the tips were broken off, and one pencil is actually missing.  This may be a good price on Amazon, but don't expect the pencils to arrive looking like they are supposed to.  I was going to put this in a Christmas stocking- definitely not going to do that.  And yes, they are impossible to sharpen without breaking the tips off constantly.  This gets two stars for the beautiful colors of the pencils and how they actually work- until they need to be sharpened.",2.0
"Too expensive at $90 and it is not what I expected. I think you could make a much better system for less money. I would not recommend buying, the turn buckle is very cheap along with the main assembly.",2.0
"The turnbuckle part, on one end, was difficult to turn much without great force using tools. It should be able to turn manually prior to assembly with other parts. Even after attempting to extend with tools, it still could not be fully extended. The metal/iron appears to be of very low quality material, and the finishing/machining was also very low quality. I'll need to buy an equivelent high quality part. Other parts were OK. Given the price of the toy, the intended use outdoors with children, and what was actually provided, I expected it should all be high to medium quality. The turnbuckle was of such low quality to the point it is unusable.

A friend bought this toy earlier and did not report these problems to us, and were happy with it. I saw him manually tighten the turnbuckle on his without a problem. Maybe a parts supplier changed recently.

UPDATE: Called SpringSwings and they sent a replacement quickly. This turnbuckle works as expected.",2.0
"When I opened this shipping box I found the pencil box was open and all the pencils were loose in the shipping box.  Additionally, 4 pencils had the tips broken.  If this was just for my use I wouldn't have been as concerned but it is a gift and now looks as though I am giving a used gift.",2.0
"I was looking forward to giving my daughter these markers. She loves to color and I wanted her to be able to practice her pencil grip with thin markers rather than the classic ""fat"" markers. For a Crayola product these were terrible. It looks like something took a chunk out of the tip of half of them. They do not draw a neat line, there were ""fuzzies"" hanging off the end of the markers before she wen used them. I would return them except she's too excited about her new marker set. Good thing they were on sale. I'll have to get something to replace them before long.",2.0
"The box was broken and smashed, color distribution eeeeemmmm was ok, the color selection of the colored pencils could be more complete or better",2.0
I do not like these! The colors are not vibrant and dry out very quickly.,2.0
"More than half of these markers are dried up. I am very disappointed. Even for the low price, I expected better from a Crayola product.",2.0
"I am a behavioral therapist working with special needs children and purchased this product to build on clients motor skills. Wonderful concept but not properly structured, the foam isn't thick enough so the pieces keep falling over.",2.0
So so~,2.0
"Boring. I don't recommend these. My sons have hardly played with them. The old flower building set that we have is far superiod. Expensive on ebay, though.",2.0
I thought Crayola meant Quality. Man was I wrong!!!! These pencils are warped so bad that when you try and sharpen them the differance from one end to the other is about a inch. Trying to sharpen these is a JOKE!! the wood is so hard and narly that I had to use a electric sharpener to do anything w/ them. Using my NEW hand sharpener it just ate up the pencil to garbage.,2.0
Every time we try to sharpen the pencils they break easily. We tried changing pencil sharpeners but still the same result.,2.0
"well , the lead breaks A LOT when sharpening.
A bit disappointed with crayola.
they have really good paints, crayons etc
will try other brands for coloring pencils",2.0
"The mat stinks of chemicals; the pegs came all loose, rattling in the box. I had bought it to give away as a gift but because of loose pegs, it appears as if it was opened item, so didn't give it as a gift. Considered keeping it for my kid but seemed very basic for the price. Returned it.",2.0
Too difficult for my toddler to use. You have to push rather hard to get the pegs in the holes of the mat and to get them to fit on top of each other. My toddler is very frustrated because of that. We have another set of pegs that he plays with often. These are just too hard to put together.,2.0
"Tips were broken & markers were leaking leaving kids hands full of stains.
They are nice colors and are great to color with.",2.0
These color pencils are great until you sharpen them and they break all to pieces.  I had so much trouble with these pencils breaking that I called crayola and complained.  Luckily they are sending me a $12.00 coupon for more crayola.,2.0
"This is convenient for little hands to hold onto and manipulate, but I don't like the fact that you can't fill the board.  36 spots for pegs, but only 21 pegs included...doesn't make sense to me!",2.0

"These are just so-so. I bought these for my daughter over the summer and they are already drying out and not really that colorful on the paper anymore, even though I'm adamant about putting the caps on tightly after use.

"We received this as a gift for my 18 month old son this past Christmas.  We were very disappointed to find that the basketball set came without a net in the box (and I notice that I'm not the only reviewer to have this problem).  I haven't heard back from the seller despite trying to contact them multiple times by phone, email and product help on their website.  I finally gave up and ordered a net directly from Little Tikes.  On the plus side, we haven't had any trouble with the rim falling off!",2.0
"This toy was purchased for my 3 year old son who loves basketball.  He loves to play with it but there is no volume control and the music repeats so often it is absolutely annoying.  My son actually asked me to turn the volume off so I took the batteries out.  Additionally, the stand is almost broken at the bottom because he likes to dunk the basketballs in.  I can't wait until it breaks so I can buy him a straightforward basketball hoop.",2.0
"I was looking forward to setting this up. My toddler loves to play ball, and he was interested in the basketball hoop at Gymboree.  However, I found two problems with this set, and I'm returning it after one day of play.  First, the plug for the water hole does not plug in tightly.  If the base is tipped over, water spills out.  Second, the rim/hoop falls down every three times my toddler puts the ball in.  He loves to shoot the ball, but I have to keep putting the rim back in.  I'll be looking for another set.",2.0
"This toy was a disappointment because the plastic it was made of was so thin that after assembling and reassemi g a couple of time the pieces broke.  In fact after only ones nth now the entire toy has been thrown away.  A complete waste of my

I read the other reviews and wish I had listened. This toy is such a great idea and I thought it would be great entertainment and educational for my 4 year old but It is so cheaply made. It is already broken he has a hard time with putting the pieces together. NOT Recommended.,2.0
"I had a marble run toy that was so much fun when I was a kid. In contrast to the marble run toy I had as a kid, this Quercetti brand marble run toy is made of poor quality plastic and is very frustrating. The kids have a much harder time putting this Quercetti marble run together than than my childhood toy (which they get to use when they visit my parents).",2.0
"We purchased this marble run for our 4-year old son because of his great love for wooden marble run assembly blocks, which he has been using since he was 2. While this set ia  terrific idea and certainly has a lot of educational value, it is made of very flimsy plastic and is in no way durable. Taking it apart and putting it back together in different configurations (which should be half the fun) always proves fatal for at least one more piece of the set for us; they crack and spliter off sharp chards every time. While I love this idea and love wooden marble sets, I regret purchasing this and certainly don't recommend it as it is made of such flimsy plastic.",2.0
This marble run game might be good for children 10 and older.  It's extremely fragile and the parts are much smaller than other marble run games I've seen.  We have a 5 and 3-year old and they lose interest quickly due to easily breaking parts and parts not fitting together well.  I would go for another game if purchasing again.  Not impressed.,2.0
really don't use it,2.0

"This toy has been in our home for only a couple of months and after minimal play (because our then 7 month old was never very interested in it), the blue paint is already coming off. We stopped letting our baby play with the toy because our 3 year old niece got her finger stuck in it and started crying hysterically within 1 minute of starting to play with it.",2.0
Did not stay in good,2.0
"My kids (4 and 6) were so looking forward to this. And yes it does ""grow"" but it is almost near impossible to make the trees and ""grass"" stand up in their designated grooves on the tray. The grooves don't hold this stuff in place, not even with tape.

Now that said, if you can get over the look of disappointment on your children's faces everytime the tree falls over, this product really does work. The blossoms and the snow are pretty amazing to see transform.",2.0
"Yes, it was cool to watch the ""crystals"" form. They were like powder puffs, and it was nearly impossible to make the different pieces of paper stand in the plastic container. When it was fully formed it was extremly fragile crumbling to the touch. Not appropriate for children who want to touch everything.",2.0
"This adapter has a short in it. I don't know if it is the product itself or the product was used to begin with. If they knew it was defected to begin with then that would be very dishonest. So as for the shipping , it was quick. Also very smooth transaction.",2.0
"Can't get them to charge my kids Innotabs.  It will charge when it's plugged it, but does not stay charged.",2.0
"Unplugs from the tablet far too easily.  When using with small children, 3-5 years old, it wiggles just a little and it is disconnected.  Would rather have seen the rechargable battery pack as a purchase option.",2.0
"The battery on the vtech innotab draines pretty quickly.  I ordered this so that my toddler could still play with his tablet.  The cord is too short.  He would have to stay in one spot close to the wall socket, which is dangerous.  After I noticed that it was too short, we haven't used it since.",2.0
"It works pretty well, but I think it should have been included in the charger or sold with the MobyGo.",2.0
"The power cord I received was a 7.5 volt cord. It was also white. Still works, but is not as shown.",2.0
"I recieved the charger in very good timeing. It works only if we keep it plugged in the wall and my child sit by the socket to play her tablet. after 2 weeks it stop charging. Not sure if i received a bad charger, but this one didn't work",2.0
"We got this AC adapter for my daughter's InnoTab because it goes through batteries like crazy! The AC adapter works great at first, but eventually stops working and we need to go get a replacement.  Too bad for Vtech, because they are spending more money on replacements of a junky product instead of making a decent product to begin with.  Right now the thing looks brand new, no tears or damage, but no matter where in the house I plug it in, it will not power up the tablet.  I'd say this one lasted about 6 months.  I think they use cheep wires inside, where you can't see if they tear.  My almost-four-year-old loves using her tablet, especially to look at before she goes to sleep, but the tablet has an auto-shut-off feature, so I don't know what's damaging the adapter; we're using it normally. I think they just sell something low-quality.
Don't spend too much money on this, and keep your receipt in case it quits on you.",2.0
"Do not think the product is very good, I brought it for my son's computer, but it only charges it when he's using it, as soon as u take it off it stops working, if I could I would want my money back to buy a new one.",2.0
"Obviously they work, but even with mild daily abuse they do not last long. We've gone through about 3 or 4 in the last year the kids have had the innotab...",2.0
"Not exactly what I thought it was. It powers up the device and allows hours of enjoyment. However... it doesnt charge the device. once unplugged from the wall or device, it reads low or dead battery.",2.0
This adaptor is nice when you are out of batteries however it would also be nice if the adaptor actually charged the innotab instead of having to be next to an outlet while its plugged in so your kid can play their game.,2.0
This adaptor is absolutely necessary because of the battery issue with the Vtech InnoTab 2. It goes through batteries like Grant through Richmond!  The cord is way too short. I'd like to see a longer cord  to allow for SOME movement while playing with tablet when it's plugged in.,2.0
"The power adapter is a must for the Innotab unless you plan on buying rechargeable batteries.

Some adapters stated they were specific but it seems that all Vtec products use the same standard AC power adapter so shop around.  Buy the $10 VTEC one instead of this one.  Same thing.",2.0
I bought this when I received a used Vtech V.Flash that was missing its adaptor.  The product description was very misleading when it said it is compatible with other Vtech toys. This adaptor is only a 9V 300mA. The game console requires 9V 1200 mA. I did not know the amps that the adaptor could put out before purchasing.,2.0
"While this adapter works fine on the V.Reader, unfortunately it sticks straight down out of the bottom of the device.  This makes it jam up against my daughter's stomach while she's using it, putting lots of pressure on the cord.  It should have been designed with a right-angle, or the power plug on the V.Reader itself should have been in a different location.",2.0
"I bought this adapter to save myself from having to buy C batteries to keep my kids v.smile going.  I wish I had just stuck with the batteries, they really do last for quite a while.  This adapter doesn't seem to fit snugly enough into the v.smile system.  My daughter is constantly coming to tell me her v.smile won't turn on.  The solution?  Jiggling the adapter into the back of the v.smile.  For 9.99 I shouldn't have to jiggle the plug every 10 mintues!",2.0
"It's a great concept but not worth the money. Some of the tasks don't go a long way toward teaching kids the skills the task is designed to teach. It looks like it was designed in a hurry, without much thought or testing and should be marketed for considerably less money.",2.0
Buttons are hard to open/close. Zip is already broken. 2 stars because my daughter still loves it but I am really disappointed,2.0
Not the one from when I was a kid. The buttons are really hard and the snaps are almost impossible to do even for an adult! The shoe string is very short to tie. I wouldn't recommend this or buy it again.,2.0
first time my grandson used it the snap broke on the shapes,2.0
Nice concept but smells bad and construction looks dubious. Is this even washable?,2.0
"I bought this for my 2-yr-old.  Six months later, she hasn't shown too much interest in it, and I don't care for the functionality.
As other reviewers noted, the buttons are very difficult even for an adult with average-sized hands to work.
The belt is too small/tight to be interesting to her and too simplistic to actually each her anything about fastening a belt.  I wish it either had a style with notches or the two d-rings that need to be navigated.
The zipper page does not allow for practice in starting the zipper - you know, the hard part that might require some effort and concentration on her part.
I haven't figured out purpose of the clock yet.
My daughter isn't ready for it yet, but the shoe-tying page might be good ... if the inherent flimsiness of a fabric book doesn't make it too difficult.",2.0
"I bought this book for my toddler to play with during church. After the first Sunday 2 of the snaps ripped off the page. The Other pages are still ok, but for a book as expensive as this one I would expect better quality. I would have returned it, but I am past the return time.",2.0
This notebook has great potential... but it didn't live up to it. Within a few days the top layer is sticking to the bottom making the toy useless. a big BIG frustration for my daughter.,2.0
"I was qutie disaoointed inthiss quiet book. There was too many repetitive pages. I had one for my child many years ago, a handmade one, and a I guess this one did not match up!!  It is the first item that I have ever returned to Amazon.",2.0
"My 20 month old wasn't able to do much of hte activities in this book, nor was my 23 month old newphew.  The buttons are too hard for them to put back one, and the belt is not easy for someone of that age to do.  Nor is tying anything of course.  I don't understand how this is recommended for 9 months and up.  So, for now I'm putting it away and hope that maybe in a year she'll like it more.",2.0
"The description failed to mention that there was a noise bell inside this ball.
That would have been good to know before purchasing.
I was actually purchasing this ball as an inside sports training aid (she is a pre-teen).
I checked the description very closely but it did not mention that this is a ""noise"" toy.
I had to return the toy.  No problems with the return.",2.0
"The ball itself is fine, it's colorful and soft, but we have owned it for a month and it the stitching is already coming undone.  Bear in mind I have a very young child - it's not been used except to roll the ball across the carpet.  Disappointing!",2.0
"Bought for 10 yr old grandson. While he enjoyed using it, the handle got very warm. Would not recommend. Light burn, not as robust as I had hoped",2.0
Not that happy with the product.  Read the warning label before using.  It may make you think twice about using this product.  I did.,2.0
"Picture on the box is very deceiving... looks like a giant stencil with letters is included but not much in the big box. Wood burning pen (no extra tips), flimsy booklet (with 1 carbon page) and some small containers of paint. NO leather, foil, sandpaper or lanyard included even though the description says it is...
Still have to use it but not really happy with the purchase.",2.0
"The stickers on the letters started to peel after a month of occasional play.  When our youngest put a piece in his mouth, the ""plywood"" came apart and he ate a few pieces of wood. If you have a kindergartener, this is a cute puzzle though not the best quality, if you have a younger toddler in the house, skip this puzzle.",2.0
"We have an older model of this puzzle, with the ""Lights, Camera, Interaction"" branding that has been used by the three older children for years. When the dog destroyed a couple letter pieces recently, I was happy to find this as a replacement
Even though the two puzzles have the same artwork and basic design, the quality difference is striking. The newer puzzle has a thinner board and pieces. The letter cut outs are less detailed, not matching the shape of the pieces. There is very little space around the piece when placed into the puzzle. It's a tight fit, making it difficult for toddlers. The finish is also rougher, so the pieces don't slide across the board and into place very easily.

I think we will be setting this new puzzle aside and letting the baby play with the old one instead. It may not have all the letters anymore, but is a more enjoyable puzzle.",2.0
This is a nice learning tool but the quality of the board was not the best.  The board started to peel the minute we opened the package,2.0
"This puzzle was bought for my toddler who is now nearly 2. While he does play with this one, he quickly tires of it for the following reasons:

-The pices don't ""fit"" into their slots like other puzzles we have purchased from the same company. In other puzzles. the pieces fit into the slot fully. This one, not so and my son is trying to push it into its slot without knowing, naturally, that the piece does not go into the slot fully to make the board totally flat.

-Two: the pieces are not shaped very well, so its confusing at times for him to understand how to position them to make them fit.

- The stickers on the pieces can be scratched out and he is actually trying to taste the glue...gross.

-the pictures on the stickers on the pieces are not vibrant and simple. They are complex, and I think it tires him out quickly.

I personally don't like this puzzle very much after seeing his response. I agree with the other reviewer that this does not help with educational purposes for young toddlers due to irregular shapes and complex stickers. Other toys from the same company were of a higher quality than this one. Go for another abcd puzzle set, skip this one.",2.0
This is such a beautiful puzzle and my toddler loves it. I bought it thinking I could help him learn the alphabet but the puzzle pieces are not really shaped like the alphabet and the picture on the puzzle peice is dustracting from the letter it is supposed to represent. Otherwise a great puzzle for older kids.,2.0
The holes for the wheel did not line up and was unable to assemble properly,2.0
Loved what it looked like but could not line up the handle and could not screw in.,2.0
"This looks super cute on the website.  It also looks super cute put together.  But, it is too small.  For little ones, the single wheel makes this a difficult toy to use.  And, the reviews are 100% correct about assembly.  Be prepared to spend some time putting this together.  Moreover, the pre-drilled holes could have been made with more care to make assembly easier.  I would not buy again.",2.0
Quality was severely lacking.  One of the wood handles was split.  The screws are worthless.  Had to send back for a replacement.  Well see if the replacement is any better.,2.0
"Got this for my son's birthday, he wanted one all summer while big sister was working with her 4-h animals.  He is stoked now that he has his own wheelbarrow.  NOTE: It was difficult to put together by myself. I had to have my husbands help.",2.0
Predrilled holes didn't line up and I had to drill them on my own. What should have taken 10 minutes took nearly an hour to assemble.  Not near the quality of other RadioFlyer products we've owned.,2.0
The parts didn't fit together properly with holes drilled in misaligned spots. Very difficult to try to put together. Didn't like that the handle rails were actually two pieces you had to screw together - seems like that would easily crack/break. Barrow part was very shallow and wouldn't have held much of anything. I returned it and ordered a Seymour wheelbarrow which we love.,2.0
"Item much smaller than expected.  Probably best for 2-4 years old max, not 3+ as it displays on the box.",2.0
"Horrible assembly! Holes were nowhere near where they should have been. We had to drill our own holes, which ruined the paint, all chipped. We haven't even used it yet. Definitely not worth the time and frustration.",2.0
"Great product once put together but rating 2 stars due to the difficulty of assembly, as I would like to see the issue get noticed and fixed, and there are many other reviews saying the same thing. Overall, assembly goes well, except for the following. The handle-poles are each two pieces that you screw a screw into to put together. The holes for these screws were not drilled deep enough, so I had to use a drill to make the hole deeper. Also, the holes were not drilled in the correct places in the wooden handle-poles, for the bolts that go through the metal frame and metal bucket. If I did not own a drill and drill bits, there is no way I could have made it fit without bending (and possibly destroying) the curved metal frames/stands. I've put a lot of things together for my family over the years, but I find it unacceptable when I have to pull out a drill for projects that should have only required hand tools.",2.0
Kind of janky,2.0
"I am returning the wheelbarrow, from the photos in the ad, it appeared a lot bigger than it is, if they had shown the photo that was on the box, or a photo of the box (see photo)  I would have known immediately which wheelbarrow they were selling and would also know it would be way too small for what I wanted. It is about the size you would get for a little girl to play with her dolls, definitely not the size for a little boy up to 6 years old to help in the garden.  I am not happy about paying 8. OO to return it.
As far as the quality of the item goes it's fine, very cute little wheelbarrow. It would be fine if you are shopping for a wheelbarrow that small. I just felt the photos in the ad were misleading.",2.0
Really hard to put together.  holes did not line up.  Made for a very stressful Christmas eve night.,2.0
"I am putting this together now for Christmas and am so thankful I didn't wait until Christmas Eve (like I usually do). Each handle of the wheelbarrow is two pieces, which is completely unnecessary. The screws provided will not hold the handles together and the predrilled holes were not done correctly. Luckily we are builders and have plenty of tools, but I don't think the average person could have fixed these issues. We've had to use different screws, a drill, a saw, wrenches and a lot of wood glue. The item itself is really cute, but definitely poor quality control.",2.0
"Argh! I am no stranger to assembling toys, furniture, etc. but this item is damn near impossible!  For starters, the handles, which have to be screwed together are not drilled properly and the screws provided are incapable of overcoming this.  A friend had to take it and basically re-drill it.  The problem continued to the holes drilled for the wheel, which were drilled sloppily, at an angle. This makes putting the wheel on all wrong as the screw now does not line up with the other pole's hole.  See photo.  This is as far as I've gotten and I am not encouraged. Once again, I will have to get someone to re-drill this.  Were it not a gift for my grandson, I would return this in a skinny minute.  I see from other reviews that my problems may be unique to this unit, but the lack of quality control it reveals is disturbing for Radio Flyer.  Sorry I bought it.",2.0
"Purchased 3 of these for small children for Christmas. Packaging and shipping time was good.  Assembly was fairly easy with one exception; the screws that were provided to secure handle elements together were useless.  Upon examination it was obvious that the screws had originally been too long and had been altered. The screws, as altered, would not pulled the two pieces of wood together, they actually pushed them apart.  A trip to a local hardware store and expenditure of 84 cents corrected the problem.  Very disappointing for a company that has been in business since 1917. Picture of provided screw attached.
Would have provided better initial grade if quality control had been better.",2.0
This is quite the piece of junk. The parts did not fit correctly. I had to do a lot of drilling and routing to get the thing together. Kid loves it though. Hopefully it will stay together.,2.0
"Tedious to assemble, screws won't line up with the holes, wheel doesnt really turn and made of plastic, but cute and my son loves it!",2.0
"I was really excited giving this to my son for his 3rd birthday, however, the screws did not line up correctly, and it could never be used.  Since I spread out.purchasing his gifts over a couple of months, the return period was over by the time of his birthday.  I should have listened to the other reviewers...lesson learned.",2.0
"Handles are poor quality, broke while assembling.",2.0
I assumed because this was Radio Flyer it would be good quality. The holes in the handle were too small making assembly a hassle. My husband had to re-drill the holes. The tire is cheap and plastic. Not what I expected.,2.0
"For the price, the handles should come preassembled or one continuous piece. They are difficult to line up, at best. The wheelbarrow is loved by the kiddos, but from a quality standpoint I think parents will find it lacking.",2.0
"Not really worth the money.  Poorly designed/engineered.  Holes don't line up.  It has 2 parts joined both threaded, WTF.  That's like mechanical engineering101.  You only need to thread/tap 1 side.  The nut that holds the wheel is either too loose and about to fall off, or the wheel is held too tight and doesn't spin.  It also doesn't say where it is made.",2.0
"Very cheap and tiny.  Not heavy metal, very thin.  My 4-year old is too tall to push this wheelbarrow comfortably.",2.0
"Very small. Also, the handlebars are 2 pieces of relatively thin wood that don't fit together snugly no matter how we pulled or pushed. I am afraid that they will snap anyday now. I love Radio Flyer products, and assumed that this wheelbarrow would be high quality like their other products, so I waited until Christmas Eve to assemble it and was so frustrated at the awful handlebars. I don't think this toy will last long.",2.0
"We bought this for our 3 year old g'son for Xmas and found when putting it together the handles were put together with wood puddy ,screws missing,
had to drill the holes on one side of handle. Very disappointed!!  Hope it last a few days after it's used.",2.0
The wooden handles did not fit together.  I had to grind the edges down to get them to fit together flush.  Other than that my kid loves it!,2.0
"This was so poorly made, wish it had not been a gift that we needed right away, I would have returned it.  Some of the holes for the screws were not drilled all the way through, luckily we could fix that.  Things did not line up, adjustments had to be made.  It looks cute now and it will be played with and enjoyed, IF it lasts.  Terrible quality, felt like we were sent factory seconds.",2.0
"Order # 115-3579956-6125846 Upper handle wood is broken and holes were not
drilled for hardware. All I need is the upper handle...I DO NOT WANT to
return the entire purchase..",2.0
Not happy with product. A hole wasn't drilled in the handle and a bolt was stripped,2.0
"The handles come in 2 pieces, so their strength will be limited at best. Also, the holes did not line up. With out the help of a mallet, I would have had to return it. Once assembled it stands just under 12"" tall and 32"" long.",2.0
Not impressed with the quality at all.  The wood striped out on a couple of the screws so now they aren't tight.  Wood handles feel as if they are going to splinter easily.,2.0
Right size for a 3 year old but cheaply made.,2.0
I don't reommend buying this product.  The handles are impossible to install with the given materials.  The holes are too small and the screws are the wrong size and type.  Fortunately my husband has a woodshop and can take care of the problem.,2.0
Mush smaller than I expected. If is too small for my 3 year old grandson to use. This item was meant to sit on shelf and look cute.,2.0
This is very cute but it is not practical or useful. Wanted something for the kids to help their dad in the yard. It's very shallow and the wheel is plastic crap. Found one at our local hardware store for the same price but much better quality. This one you are paying for the name. This would work well if you're planning to cart barbies around indoors :),2.0
"My boys received this for Christmas a two years ago and it has gotten lots of play.  It is very small as others have mentioned, but the biggest reason for my 2 star review is the handles.  I don't know if its just ours or if all have the same design, but the handles are not one piece of solid wood....and the joint of the wood pieces fall where there is the most pressure from use/lifting.  Ours broke at the joint after just a few months of outdoor use.  It still gets lots of play and we have replaced the handles with solid pieces to make it last.",2.0
"Two grandsons and one granddaughter LOVED this wheelbarrow, which was purchased to replace a 20+ year old radio flyer kid's wheelbarrow that finally wore out - on the new one the gauge of the metal is thinner, the paint wasn't applied as nicely and within 6 years it had deteriorated and begun to rust.

These issues are NOT the fault of the seller - just keep in mind, like most things manufactured now, the quality and construction is sometimes not as good as what was made previously.  If I were to buy this again I'd make sure it was kept indoors and always stored clean and dry (try to get a 5 year old to do that all the time!)",2.0
"this isn't large enough to put anyhting more than a cantaloupe in...the handles aae 8"" off the floor....what a huge mistake!",2.0
"This was a gift for my nephew, and since I could not attend his 4th birthday I sent him this. I was so sad, when I found out that it was missing 6 screws, and he was unable to put it together on the day of his birthday. :(",2.0
"This review is not fully about the actual products quality, but more that my son (3 1/2 years old) has not been playing it with it as much as I had anticipated. We bought it for xmas along with some rakes, brooms, etc for pretend play and he just does not use the wheelbarrel at all. It is a bit hard for him to balance and so he is using it now just to play car races and building legos. He is a very active, coordinated boy so it is not that he doesnt know how to use it-  I think it needs more stability, at least another wheel possibly or maybe as he gets older he may develop more of an interest.",2.0
"This product did not last at all.  Only last 2 months.  The leg broke, we try to put crazy glue, did not work.  Kids are kids and they play rough, toys has to made with good materials so they last.  I won't recommend this product to kids who wants to play with the toy, now if you want to put it in the china closet is fine.",2.0
This toy fell apart within a week of playing with it. First a leg and then the lower half of the body.,2.0
"Cheaper quality than I was expecting. Quality control leaves much to be desired. One queen is labeled ""Regina."" The knights are backwards. Came with an extra white pawn (which is fine I suppose). Will get the job done for my kids to learn on before we upgrade to a nicer set.",2.0
"Instead of having All the pawns needed for the black set, a bishop and a rook! So now we will have to find pieces to make this not so confusing for our 8 year old. If it came with All the right pieces I'd be over the moon happy. It could be a great set for a beginning chess player.",2.0
"I learned on a similar chess set back in the very early 80's (Edit: it was the Educator one).  It was definitely not fancy - just a normal lightweight game board and plastic pieces.  But I really remember liking the reminder of how each piece moved when I was learning to play.  Fast forward a generation...  The game board is a quad-fold (so it would fit in a smaller, cheaper box) that is difficult to set fully flat.  The pieces are poorly molded and finished (and hollow).  But all of that would have been tolerable, if it weren't for the Knight's head being on backwards.",2.0
"Very very very very very cheap set.  Pieces are hollow cheap plastic.

This knights in our set are actually molded backwards.",2.0
"VERY cheap quality, plastic pieces, thin cardboard chess board that folds in quarters.  Our set was missing a pawn and when we reached out to seller, we received no response.  Oh well, I guess this is another lesson in you get what you pay for!  I will admit that having the pieces identified and moves detailed on the pieces themselves is very helpful for young learners.  The only problem is my 10 year old can already beat me now!",2.0
"I had a set like this when was a kid (30 years ago).  I thought I was getting the same thing, but this set is much lower quality than the one I had in the 80's.  The pieces are hollow, too light, and they have no felt on the bottom.  The knights on BOTH SIDES face the wrong way.

This is a low quality set.",2.0
"The game overall is relatively flimsy in design. The instructions are weak and unclear in several scenarios you encounter during chess. Other than the pieces, showing where pieces can move, I had to Google further instructions for help.",2.0
I found the board to be very disappointing but it was fine for a five year old and the directions were good.,2.0
"I thought the pieces would be heavier.  They are made of really thin plastic that is going to be easy for my 6yo to break.
Love the piece's allowed movement on each one though.  Maybe I'll be able to play one day too! :)",2.0
Simple yet great way to learn chess.  Christmas gift for grandson and he loves it.  Prompt shipment by seller and exactly as described.,2.0
My kids are not getting as much use out of this as I had hoped.,2.0
"We were delighted to receive this toy as a gift, but greatly dismayed after assembling it to discover that it does not fold and must remain permanently open, which is a huge storage problem.  Probably it would be better to get an easel that is foldable, even if it is larger.",2.0
It's hard to move the hands of clock--I do wish that you could adjust more easily if you needed to go backwards. It's ok.,2.0
really small i expected it to be a little bigger. was so tiny,2.0
Only complaint I have is that the short arm doesn't exactly pin point on some of the numbers which made it confusing at first for a child who is learning how to tell time. And the only way to change the time is by ONLY moving the long arm on the clock. I had to unscrew and fiddle with it to make it a little better so the short arm lands on the hour that it's supposed to be on.,2.0
"We ordered this for our daughter with the hopes of surprising her with a back to school gift. While the toy itself is interesting, there was no guide or instructions including in the tub. A phone call to the company resulted in us being directed online where only the simplest of instructions exist in PDF format. Those neat photos of different designs they advertise? They only exist to sell the product, there is no detailed instructions or inspiration to guide you or your frustrated youngster in assembling their latest endeavor. The tub boasts three designs you will find yourself scrutinizing closely to aid in the assembly of a base product to demonstrate the concept of the toy to your child with. The tub contains a box full of potential and utterly no inspiration to feed the imagination potential. Sorely disappointed.",2.0
Didn't realize it would be so small,2.0
Wouldnt buy to hard to use.,2.0
Okay product....a little pricey for what you get and smaller than picture is posted,2.0
"Read the Description Carefully....this is the small one, not the large teacher clock. This is WAY overpriced. Cant be worth more than a dollar. You  can buy packs of several of these for the same cost.",2.0
"Only turns clockwise, so have to go all around if past the time you want. The back leg comes off easily.",2.0
The gears are easily misplaced so that the hour doesn't line up exactly when the minute is on the 12. The removable kickstand in the back is a joke. Why not make a folding one?!,2.0
This toy was so much fun for my grandson but the connector pieces and the gears wear down rendering them unable to stay together to make something.  That is why the down grade in rating.  The pieces should last more than a month and half.,2.0
"Had to return. The gear is not set accurately (or the teeth are just a tad bit too large for this particularly clock) so when the clock is at the top of the hour, the hour hand is slightly off the hour (ahead). Every hour, the ""tad"" grows in the same increment, until at 5 o'clock, the hour hand is clearly well off the hour.  So at 5:00, the hour hand is not sitting on the 5 and looks more like it would if it were 5:10 or 5:15.  The hour hand continues to get further and further ""off"" as you move the minute hand hour by hour.  There is no way to manually reposition the hour hand to correct this.  Since it was a gear issue, I did not seek a replacement. I figured that the gears were created in bulk to supply this product. It is highly unlikely that the teeth on my gears were larger than the rest of the gears. I could be wrong about this. I am looking forward to reading other reviews to see if I just got a dud.  Had to send it back because my daughter is highly visual. She noticed the hour hand was off immediately and it confused her.",2.0
"""These gears make the kids think while they are building items.  Fun to see how each of them make more things turn as they build as well.  So glad I bought one for each of my grandsons!  I think they will continue using these unlike some toys that they outgrow.  Can't see that happening and also these are very well made!""  That was my original review....then we actually played with them.  I think they aren't going to be used much after seeing that my 5 yr. old grandson could care less!  Hopefully the interest will spark.  I did show him how they could be used but no interest at this point.",2.0
Needs total dedication and a lot of hours to enjoy it. Not a fun party game for sure.,3.0
Interesting approach to a strategic game for Game of Thrones. No Targeryns and only has the Westeros map. There could be potential of an expansion if they think about the Night King or dragons.,3.0
This game is fairly complicated. You will need several patient people. I could not find these people.,3.0
"I love board games.  I purchased this for my friend who is very into Game of Thrones, and he was very into the story and the characters.  I, who know nothing about Game of Thrones, was not impressed by the game mechanics and found it to be slightly repetitive and boring.  Kind of like risk, but shorter and less involved.",3.0
"Sooo many pieces, complicated and takes a while to set up and figure out.",3.0
Love the game! Only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is because my package came with a big crack in the back of the box. For $35 I shouldn't have gotten damaged product.,3.0
its a little on the confusing side.,3.0
"One of the most difficult to learn/setup/play board games ever.  Very long running time with very few concise out comes.  A s*** ton of outside of game politicking which leads to a lot of Risk like arguments.

Don't recommend this to casual game of throne fans, and don't recommend to casual board game fans.

I REALLY don't recommend this to people who drink with their friends when you play this game.  I think everyone was completely wasted by the time we were half way through.",3.0
"This game can be very entertaining, but it is slow and complex, meaning it won't be for everyone.  The biggest problem I have with Android is that it takes so long to play, especially if the people at the table are not experienced gamers; don't be surprised when you convince friends and family who are not serious about gaming to try this and it takes the entire day.  Despite enjoying the game, I must confess it sets a slow pace and isn't particularly exciting enough to sustain that many hours of gameplay.

The designers definitely could've cut down the number of components the game ships with, there are just too many tiny cardboard pieces to keep track of.  Some of these pieces weren't necessary as there are more intuitive ways of tracking game information, but cardboard pieces were probably the cheapest, so it's not difficult to see why they chose this path.

But frankly, Android has the most fragile game board I've ever played with, the number of small tokens, counters, and trackers that must be in exactly the right place mean the slightest table bump or unchecked arm movement can send pieces flying out of position, which is never a good thing.

Another complaint is that, at least in my experience, the complex interactions and variety of strategies and options are often times wasted as it seems more efficient to pursue the most basic action of collecting evidence instead of performing one of the game's many advanced options (killing a suspect, piecing together the conspiracy, etc).

This could just be the steep learning curve the game has, making it a long time before players realize when and how to take advantage of these mechanics, but even among knowledgeable and experience gamers I found that none of us were taking these advanced actions because doing so meant sacrificing several opportunities to place evidence on a suspect and receiving very little gain in return.  This is especially true since many of these actions require that you take other actions to make them useful, eating up a lot of time, and if the other players are only placing evidence you'll fall behind since doing so provides the biggest opportunity for victory in the game.

What really surprised me about the slow pace and advanced strategies was the contrast to the twilight cards the game uses.  These are basically two decks of cards, one called a Light Deck that is beneficial and can only be played on yourself, and a Dark Deck that is harmful and only used against the other players.

Many of these cards are startling powerful in comparison to the rest of the game, forcing players to discard all of their cards or favors, preventing them from acting on a turn, etc.  Worse yet, there seems to be no way to counter a card (and they're very easy to play), so once they've been used you can do nothing but suffer the consequences.  Nothing is more disturbing than the sickening feeling you get when other players hit you with these cards during the last two rounds of the game and all the strategy and effort you put in were for naught because your opponents happened to draw one of the more powerful cards available, causing you to lose a game of slow, complex game strategy due to dumb luck and no skill on anyone's part.  These moments made me feel like I had stepped out of Android and into another game, they just don't mesh well with the feel and pace the rest of the game offers.

For every one of these powerful cards you draw, there will be several that provide very little benefit and are mostly played to get them out of your hand.  You cannot exceed the draw cap in this game and simply discard down to the legal amount later, or discard without spending time during your turn, so being able to get a card out of your hand is very valuable, and most of the game is spent playing these weaker cards in order to do just that, with the hope that the next card(s) you draw will be better.

Lastly, many of the negative effects have stipulations under which they can be played.  Many of these stipulations involved the advanced mechanics of the game, giving players even fewer incentives to do anything other than follow evidence around the board, because to do otherwise would put them at risk of being targeted by a powerful card.

Despite these complaints, I do enjoy Android.  I do, however, feel that the game could've been streamlined in a few areas, and this becomes readily apparent when you've been playing the game for several hours and realize everyone at the table has been just been placing evidence in the same routine manner while whittling down their decks to find those really powerful cards that will cripple other players by setting them back an entire round or more and require very little strategy to play.

Android is best played with veteran gamers who won't mind the lack of polish, will explore the game's depth out of curiosity, and really get into the rich history and story the game provides through it's setting, characters, and scenarios.  In short, if your friends like to read the quotes and flavor text on cards and sheets, they will probably get into this game.  If not, then they might not enjoy it since immersing yourself into the game world is a major part of the experience.

Android is brilliant and beautiful, but flawed and unpolished.  Be sure you know what you're getting and who your fellow players are before purchasing this game.",3.0
"I had a chance to play this twice... the first we spent about 3 hours playing it with 3 players and got half way through the game... the 2nd time we had 6 players and it took over 5 hours to play the game (we accelerated the game rounds by 2 because it was taking too long and our girlfriends were disengaged with the game).... this game is complicated.

- You need to strategically move army units. in theory you can form alliances but I don't see the real benefit of it unless one player is really doing well. You have several order tokens: move / attack using your units, defend, claim a crown (which is what you use as currency for bidding and claiming land), raid, support.
- You need to bid on the iron throne, bid on the raven, bid on the sword - all of these alter the game order, game play, military ties and strength, gives you an ability to view wildling cards and gives you stars (which will allow you to use special orders). All of these can have an advantage during the game.
- After you've figured out your orders... then you need to settle 3 random events that happens in Westoro's... usually this is where you can reap the rewards of your land that you've conquered, potentially grow your military units, re-adjust your supply (which might allow you to grow or reduce your army size).
- and then you also see if a Wilding attack happens.

Complicated? Yes. There are also ports / ships which allow you to transport army units.

I think this game reminds me of a much more complicated version of Sons of Anarchy.... but the problem with Game of Thrones is the lack of negotiation or bribery.... it's more of a very hardcore version of Risk. I'm not sure if the game is completely balanced as each team starts off in a different area, and they have different combat abilities (seen in their special cards).

One of the other things in the game is that it could end up like Risk, where one or two groups will be wiped out of Westoros... and basically a few players will have nothing to do but just sit there waiting for several hours.",3.0

This game takes about the same number of hours to play as there are people playing. 3 people will take 3 hours. 2 will take 2 etc.  But it feels too short for a giant game like civ

As a long time PC Civ fan I was very excited for this game. The problem is that you only have 20 or so turns to develop your civ before somebody claims military, cultural or scientific victory...I am yet to see an economic victory.

This is not close to enough turns to have a satisfying game of civ.

Not to mention the fact that when you win there's just this awkward silence...
The game has no climax whatsoever....you will find yourself less and less interested as the game goes.

My last complaint is that by half way through the game you have so many little powers that you will loose track.  Every government card, cultural card, faction card, science card, and all else gives you a power...there's no way you can remember when and where to use them.

Not to mention that this game has a billion pieces....you can see what problems this will lead to....

Those are a lot of cons, but overall the game is fairly fun.  I have played it around 10 time and have had many good time playing it.., but I would definitely recommend dominion or 7 wonders over this game.",3.0

"My husband and I are fans of the PC version of this game. We've been looking for a new hobby and we thought that this tabletop version would be a great way to spend time together.
First of all, this game comes with a lot of pieces. A LOT. So setup time can be slow, and finding a way to store all the bits and pieces can be a pain (we ended up using sandwich bags, but a dividable plastic container might be better). We probably spent 3-4 hours the first time just setting up the game and getting the basics of gameplay down, so its also not a quick endeavor (That isn't including the time it takes to pop all of the pieces out of the frames).
We still haven't had a proper beginning to end game because after setting everything up and getting the game going we end up losing steam to play because so much time has already passed. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it, but if you've never played tabletop RPG-type game before (like me) it can be overwhelming and complex.
We're going to keep at it because both my husband and I see the value and potential fun of the game, but it's not a pull out of the box and start playing type of game.",3.0

"This is an alright game but not one that is particularly for me.  It is a combat oriented area control game and it feels very much like a war game but I'm sure war game fans would take issue with that.

The last couple of times I played a war game with any kind of weight were Axis and Allies: 1942 and Risk Legacy and I did not enjoy them at all.  This game shares a lot of the problems I have with those games.  I'm not a fan of static setups for one.  Aside from the amount of time it takes to set up a game there are some balance issues there I think.  It appears that the players in the center of the map are at a disadvantage needing to fight a 2-front war while the Starks and Martells only need to worry about bolstering to their south or north respectively.  This also can cause the game to feel stale if you end up playing the same House multiple times since you always start out the same way and probably need to follow similar strategies.

The combat system is almost identical to Kemet, which I actually like.  In fact, I like this system a little bit better because each House has a deck of combat cards that are unique and many of them have special abilities on them besides the normal combat, casualty, and defense numbers.  I'm a fan of asynchronous player abilities and this works well to differentiate the different Houses, plus if you're a Song of Fire and Ice fan it is neat to be able to see all the different familiar character art.

The art is very good too, in fact the production values of this game are very good.  The pieces are all attractive although they could have been differentiated a little bit more.  Once the board is filled with plastic it can be hard to tell which pieces are footmen, knights, and siege engines at different angles.  The bonus tokens for the influence tracks are gigantic things making them seem to carry a particular weight of importance.  The board is also nice looking and despite the amount of information each area conveys does a good job of not looking cluttered or confusing.  The one other complaint I would levy against the components, and it is minor, is the order tokens should have symbolized which house they belong to on both sides.  In a game with a large number of players and especially with players moving and invading different areas they can get a little mixed up or confusing.

I guess where the game eventually falls for me, and why it is not a keeper, is it doesn't do much to justify the length and trouble it takes to get it played.  Users here on BGG say it is best with 6, which I agree with, and it also takes 3 hours.  I think that's an optimistic estimate with 6 players.  The first time I played with 6, including a rules explanation to be fair, we hit 3 hours at almost the exact halfway mark.  This is a 5-hour game with 6 players, you might be able to trim that to 3.5-4 hours with experienced players but you have to play a few 5 hour games to get players to that point first.  Not to mention getting 6 people together to play a game that long is not an easy task.

And honestly, I just have better (in my opinion) games that fill the same roles.  Kemet is incredibly similar and plays in a 3rd of the time or less and has more variability with the special powers, which is more my style anyway.  Even Small World, also with variable powers, scratches that combat/area control itch.  And if I am going to play a game for 5 hours there are games I would prefer to pull out as well, like Merchant of Venus.  So ultimately I just don't think I would ever reach for this game over others.",3.0

However, after watching the tutorial on YouTube and spending 2+ hours reading the instructions plus online resources I was convinced there was no way I could explain this game to my friends in a reasonable time frame.

I was right after 30m of explanation we gave up and played something else.

To be fair it looks like a great game if everyone knows how to play but people need to watch the tutorial and read the instructions ahead of time. Even then I'm sure the first few games will prompt several are we doing this 'right' questions.

The game is billed as 3-6 players. Based on the rules it would do best as a 5-6 player game. Also plan on 3-4 hours maybe longer for your 1st time through.",3.0

"While I found many of the mechanisms very intriguing, the game is definitely too heavily weighted toward certain houses. For example, House Baratheon and Greyjoy are incredibly strong and House Lannister is very weak. Because of this, it makes the game less enjoyable for a group of players who are equally experienced with the game. A group of experienced players can only hope that their opponents with the stronger houses slip up and make a few ill-conceived moves. In any case, you're really only going to be playing for up to three hours without any possibility of winning.

But don't get me wrong, the game isn't completely terrible. I love the ASOIAF universe so of course I loved the theme. And like I said before, I found many of the game's mechanics very enjoyable. The placement of the order tokens during each round is a lot of fun and not knowing what your opponents are playing makes this very tense. All in all, gameplay is a blast and if it all the houses were equal in strength I think it would see the table a lot more. It's just not fun playing for 3+ hours and knowing you have absolutely no chance of winning.",3.0

I think what ruins the game though, and why I rank it so low, is the fact that it's so easy to win. Unless you play with 5-6 people, It's a breeze to get through a game. There's just too many open spaces and too few peoples (when playing with 3-4 people) to make it even a slight challenge.

"Talisman is one of the most difficult games to find time to play with my group, with an average game length of 4 hours (for 4-6 players). At few points in the game does it feel like a mental battle of wits between multiple parties. The most exciting parts of the game are dice battles between two evenly matched opponents. Randomization is absolutely the biggest problem with Talisman, even if I like the theme and character building aspects.

Your average turn consists of:
1. Roll and move clockwise or counterclockwise
2. Drawing a random card from the deck
3. Fighting a random dice battle with enemies

The players are run around the starting area seeing who can luck into the best items and stats until inevitably someone becomes strong enough, gathers a Talisman, and moves in for the Crown of Command to see if they can win the game. Who becomes the most powerful is very rarely a test a skill, but rather who draws the best items or gets a few lucky rolls. The test of skill in this game is deciding when you are powerful enough to attempt the inner areas of the board.

It's the kind of game that you can spend 5 minutes in between turns that have zero effect on you. The minimal choices and large amounts of downtime make it a social game, but since a slow played six player game can last up to 6-7 HOURS, it is absolutely grueling at times. Never have I seen a board game group more beaten and slumped than at hour 6 in a game of Talisman. It's not at all that the game isn't fun, but in my experience it's a bit of a hassle scheduling time to play such a light game then having to worry about players getting bored with such a light, lengthy game.

"I like this game.  It's entertaining, funny and seemingly well balanced.  The overall quality of the materials is good with the exception of the plastic player pieces that seem like they will snap at the base pretty readily.

My biggest problem with the game is the size of the cards that go with it.  In a game that otherwise uses pretty high quality of materials it seems like they tried to cut cost by reducing the size of the cards to less than half the surface area of a regular playing card.  There is plenty of room in the box to hold larger cards so it was not a space in the box.  Since the cards are a major aspect of the game and require shuffling, regular handling, etc, this is disappointing.  It actively affected my game experience.  I would have been much happier paying a few dollars more to get normal sized cards.

I will definitely think twice before I purchase another Fantasy Flight Game, keeping this in mind.  I'm not saying I won't buy it, but I'll keep this in mind.",3.0
"I am all for zany, wacky board games as a filler, which is what I imagined this game to be. But in my opinion it seems to drag on for quite a bit, which is hard for me to say as I can play multi hour marathon games and not be bored with my group, but there's so much to keep track of during each turn that things seem to take forever.

Another factor is that at the end of each player's turn, they are forced to pick up event cards, which are usually bad things like 'This compartment of the ship is now on fire!', or 'This compartment of the ship is full of water!'..but it gets old and feels like you are getting pummeled over and over.

With a 7 player game we played, it took almost 2 hours to finish, not for lack of trying either. With every player causing events over and over and over I was internally begging for this game to end, which is not something I normally do. I'll play it again in time now and then, but, it is definitely not the filler game I expected",3.0
"I own and play both the first and second editions, and unquestionably, the second edition is both fairer and more strategic. Adding ports, removing Robb from the Starks (he's back but with a much less game-breaking ability on his card), setting up the Martells in the south to compete directly with Baratheon as well as Tyrell are all important steps. To me the biggest change though is adding that starred * Consolidate Power tokens now allow the faction to Muster, in that square, a number of points equal to the strength of the castle/stronghold (ie 0/1/2) there-- without a Mustering card. In doing so you sacrifice the 1/2 power tokens though. Adds a lot of depth, not to mention strategic choice, early in the game.

However, the game really could have gone through some play testing. The Greyjoys now have ridiculous House Cards, so, with just a little careful husbanding and an early first clash of kings, they can wipe the Lannisters entirely out of the game. There are very few defensive moves Lannisport can make. (One game they used their *Consolidate Power every turn to pump out ships, but even with a fleet of 3+2=5 (their supply max), the Greyjoys wiped them out with a mere 2 ships (because they'd held both stars and the Sword, but mostly because of the House Card Victarion Greyjoy). Just nothing they can do about it.)

Further there is a noted problem with the boards shipping warped and being of poor quality.

"A group of friends and I just started a board game group a few months ago and Talisman was one of the first games we tried out, and we've all generally enjoyed it. When sitting down to play with more than two people, plan on a 3-4 hour minimum game time, longer if you have one or more friends that go slow and agonize over strategy, like mine do.  Actually, the game speed is one thing I really like about Talisman, compared to some of the other ""grown-up"" board games from Fantasy Flight. There's much less to strategize about, so gameplay moves more quickly and players that don't strategize as much, and those that are just playing for the fun and companionship (like me) don't feel like they're losing from turn one.

The game itself is well-made, although I wish the character pieces were a little easier to tell apart.  I like the humor that is built into the game text, and the flexibility of the gameplay as far as character movement and development.  The directions look daunting, but are clear and logical. The board itself is HUGE, it will take up your entire dining room table and may hang a bit off the edges, leaving no room for anyone to store their cards and character sheet.  We have solved this problem by pulling the table into the middle of the room and situating a tray table next to each player to sort out character information, cards and such.

One thing I would caution about, since the game does take awhile to play, and is addictive enough to make you want to pull it out at every opportunity,  it's easy to burn out on.  Then you find yourself needing an expansion, and then another, and then another.  I would recommend spacing out your gameplaying, so you don't get tired of Talisman, and don't find yourself spending $30 to $60 dollars on another expansion every two weeks!  That said, the ability to expand on the original gameboard, add alternate ending options, and new characters is one of the reasons I picked up this game, and one of the things I like about it.  It provides plenty of variety in the gameplay experience so that combined with the quality of construction, I'm sure we'll be playing and enjoying this game for many years to come!",3.0

And for those novices looking at the Ouija Board for the first time, there is a one-page entertaining comic-page instruction featuring Willow, Dawn, and Xander as the wise witch gives Xander the details on how to use the board, and that it is not for fun, to which Xander replies, ""What? I'm serious . . .""

"I have been gaming Dungeons and Dragons for about 20 years now.  Switched to Pathfinder when Wizards of the Coast decided to walk away from 3.5 and move to the abomination that is 4th edition.  Pathfinder is good, but not perfect.  Anyone familiar with the systemic issues in D&D 3.5 will see them return in PF but compared to 4th edition its a solid game.

Anyhow decided to purchase this to introduce my 11 year old daughter and her friends to role playing.  Its not a bad product but it leaves a lot to be desired.  It is very short, like 2-3 hrs, and pretty laughably challenging.  For the kiddos it was fine but for anyone interesting in testing the system it is pretty thin.",3.0

"The Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box is a great introduction to new players of RPG's and especially helpful for a new DM. I'm only giving it three stars as it sort of abruptly ends.

There is no clean transition or help for guiding a DM into another Paizo campaign easily. This sort of made me (the DM) feeling left out in the cold when I started to try to figure out how to take my party's characters further into an adventure.",3.0
"Overall I really like it, it just misses the mark for me, see I find the full PF game system just too damn big and crunchy for my tastes, I was really hoping for a set of rules like the old D&D Basic & Expert (old Red/Blue) box sets, allowing you to play up to at least 10 or 15th level, something to use as a main set of rules, for us who don't have time for these huge mega books with a million and one rules crammed in them and a thousand splat books but capping it at 5 levels kinda sucks, I hope they bring out maybe another box set and expand it a few more levels, maybe to 14th level like the old Expert set, that would be nice.",3.0
"I can see them as being my favorite dice set out of the 3 sets I own, but when I got them a lot of the black ink was chipped or worn. I had to touch at least three of the dice up with my ink pen.

"These dice are absolutely gorgeous and catch everyone's eye at PFS tables. From an aesthetic standpoint, I absolutely adore them.

The problem with them, though, is that the paint is very cheap and they're already starting to chip and fade. I'm not hard on my dice and I only use them once a week for standard 4-hour scenarios. Despite that small amount of use, these dice are already dying after just a few months of use.

A beautiful product but maybe meant for display only?",3.0
"It seems like a great puzzle, but it was missing one piece when we opened up the box. We immediately went to their website and used their email form to ask for a replacement.

Same thing, and still no response. We got this as a gift and can't easily return it to where it was purchased since that store is 2 hours away.

1.  It is small.  Like really small.  I popped out my tape measure thinking, surely this is not 8 inches.  Thats what she said right?
2. It is so light!  It definitely doesn't seem to be made of very high quality material, and that chain is so flimsy, that it looks like it could break quite easily.
3.  Just looking at the picture, and comparing it to the bank I am holding in my hands .... my bank does not look as nice as this picture.  There is blue from the pants in small areas of the abdomen, and the black looks like it was applied with a trowel on mine.

Over all, it was a nice idea, but I definitely think I over paid for the quality of product I received.  3 stars for it not being a total failure.  If they used better materials I would have gone with a 4 or even 5 star review, even with the poor paint job.",3.0
Most people buy the booster box in hopes of getting all the rare cards wanted without having to spend a whole lot of money buying the cards they want separately. Hopefully you get lucky and get the cards you want :-) as for me I normaly don't get the card I want when buying a booster box which is the secret rare card. The last time I got a secret rare I wanted was when I pulled Judgements Dragon 2 years ago.,3.0

"Here's what I really like:
-The basic game mechanic ensures that the more treasure you take, the harder it will be to escape the temple alive.  Drawing more cards creates movement penalties, but you need the loot to win!
-Each round is 5 simple phases. (Not as complicated as all the different pieces and card decks might make it look.)
-4 players can finish an entire game in about an hour.
-Great artwork and high-quality components.  It's really cool when those blocks come crashing down- unless one hits you!

And here's what I don't like:
-It's possible to get trapped in the temple.  I know the idea is to create tension by letting the players choose when to try to leave the temple instead of having a set number of turns, but when players know they have no chance of winning after all the time and strategy invested, it can make some people (or kids) not want to play this one again.  Plus some players will get out, and others are still in there for 2 or 3 more turns, and the ones that got out early have nothing to do except wait to find out if they won.
-A LOT of card-drawing and dice-rolling.  A little bit of luck can be a good thing in a thematic game like this, but there is so much randomness on every turn - from movement to the value of treasure-, that the main strategy gets narrowed down to just getting a big variety bonus.

A more competitive treasure-grab game that I prefer is ""Cadwallon: City of Thieves,"" also published by Fantasy Flight Games.  It's more ""dark fantasy"" and less ""tomb raider"".  You have a time limit to escape your team of thieves from the city after most of the gates crash, and I enjoy the element of that game that lets you grab loot off of other players.

If you prefer a less competitive game and don't mind the amount of luck involved, you'll have fun with ""The Adventurers,"" especially with kids or non-boardgamers who enjoy the tomb raider/Indiana Jones theme.",3.0
It came broken so I had to re-glue one of the wings but it looks nice so it has that going for it. It's a ltitle small but still a cool thing to have if you're a huge GoT fan.,3.0

"This bag is okay, it will work for now though I may end up replacing it down the road.

Pros:
The bag itself seems like it could hold up pretty well and has plenty of room (I put 3 sets of dice in and it was maybe half full).

Cons:
As another reviewer mentioned, the sword is not blue. It is a shiny gray/silver that looks and feels like the just threw glitter on in the design of a sword. The shape and the design of the sword is the same but definitely not blue.
The strings to close seem a little flimsy. I had to tighten the knots on the ends shortly after pulling it out of the box and again a several hours later. However when I got it the knots were a bit close to the ends so when I tightened them the second time I pushed them just a tad further down and the knots seem to be staying tight now.",3.0
My issue is that when I bought this I didn't see a description of the size. I thought the dragon would be the size of the other Deluxe Figures but its way smaller than them. Basically its the size of the Dragons in Astapor when compared to the Khaleesi.,3.0
Smaller than it looks!,3.0
"My husband collects D&D and Pathfinder minis mainly. The figure is made of hard plastic and the base is very heavy. The details are weak and the paint is flat. The paint job on the wings does not look like the picture. I don't believe he would have purchased this figure if he had seen the figure in person prior, even with the Amazon Lightening deal price. For die hard GoT fans, what can you do... it's Drogon.",3.0

"Unless you are a hard-core LOTR LCG collector, there are other adventure packs (AP) that will add more useful cards to your card pool AND offer more exciting and replayable quests. This AP does have one of the most powerful ally cards in the game (Gildor Inglorion) and some Eagle trait support (Descendant ally). The LOTR core set is a requirement to play this AP also.",3.0
"When I opened the package, one of the two front prongs on the nose was busted off already.  Wouldn't have been a big deal as super glue would've fixed it right off with no visible marks, however the broken piece was nowhere to be found.  For this reason I took off two stars.  Want others to be aware that such thing is capable of happening to them.  It was packed and shipped really well, but either the store that sold it through amazon had the figure on display and busted the tip when they repackaged it, or it happened at the manufacturer.
Overall though it's a very nice model of the Normandy.  It feels solid and thick and the paint job is mostly ok (with the exception of a couple areas).  Price seems a bit high for such a small model.  I'd love to have one twice this size.",3.0
"A fine specimen of the SR-1 from Mass Effect that would likely make most Mass Effect fans happy. It's detail is immaculate and looks nearly identical to the respective virtual spacecraft.

So, why three stars? - the scale of this entire model series from Dark Horse, despite it being true that the claim was never made that they'd be to scale, is all over the place...and it gets too hard to ignore when it comes to the SR-1. I can guarantee most (if not all) ME fans are interested in these models due to their virtual counterparts one might collect in-game, so it would be nice if they'd at least compare to that standard.

As others have said, this product would be great for any 'diehard' ME fan, but any such fan would certainly know the difference between a frigate, cruiser, and dreadnought. This lack of respect of the canon is painfully seen in the rest of this model series. Examples: a 6"" Alliance Shuttle (very small in-game) compared to a 6"" SR-2 Frigate (can hold several shuttles). Or these 6"" models compared to a 6"" Turian Cruiser (larger by far in-game). Or all these models compared to a 9""(!) Alliance Cruiser (same size in-game as the Turian ship). I realize exact ratios are improbable (if not impossible), but to not follow any standard whatsoever makes this ME fan quite disappointed...yet still a forgivable offence, as there appears to be little standard held up in the virtual models...

...except when it comes to the SR-1 vs SR-2. Despite both ships belonging to the Frigate class, it is mentioned several times that the SR-2 is nearly twice the size of the SR-1, and just in case the player can't figure this out for themselves, it's nicely pointed out in comparing the virtual models provided in-game. Even the level of detail in the SR-1 is pointedly plain compared to the SR-2, simply because it's obviously supposed to be smaller...even the supplied picture of the model makes it look smaller. So, when an ME fan is buying these models to reproduce that virtual model collection, why would Dark Horse make the SR-1 the same size as the SR-2? - it literally makes absolutely no sense.

Again, a great 1-time purchase for the odd fan, but unfortunately a terrible headache for a collector.",3.0
"I already own a version of the Normandy SR-2 Cerberus version that I am very satisfied and wanted to supplement the first version of the Normandy SR-1.

It really is very nice too, but I'm pretty amazed at the scale chosen, because the SR-1 is as large as the SR-2!

It is true that at the scale ca would probably been smaller but more realistic in order to assess changes between the first and second release!",3.0
"It is cool. Think a larger model would be much better someday. This particular one fell short, and seemed a bit pricy.",3.0
"If you plan to play the base game with more than 5 people then this is a must, Other than that it just adds a few more races.  i feel the core game adds plenty and doesn't really need this or any of the other expansions.",3.0
ok - cheap quality,3.0
I thought these were going to be higher quality (like the ones that are metal with the picture wrapped around it) - they are actually more of like a sheet that is just printed and punched. They are still kind of cool but I'd have gladly paid more to have them be a higher quality product.,3.0
"I bought this as a gift and it went over great. But, the magnets are kind of cheaply made. I was expecting them to be a little more heavy duty.",3.0
"The magnets are not thick and sturdy like Hodor, more like Jon Snow - kinda sturdy, but pretty flaky.
The label side of one magnet is already peeling, so I'll need to repair it.
They're all presented well, the label is crisp and vibrant, and they hold papers up nicely, but they're not the quality you get in a ski shop or something.",3.0
Its fun if you like the series but the magnets have to be popped out of a sheet and it kind of messes up the picture if you don't do it just right.,3.0
"The large, garishly decorated box comes chock-full of colorful cards, unpainted but detailed plastic miniatures, and very, very sturdy cardboard chips and modular map tiles. Overall, the quality of production of the pieces is top-notch in every respect. Graphics are detailed and well-done, and most of the important information is in large lettering on the cards, allowing one to quickly survey a situation without having to pick up everything. That being said, three of the four player figures look nearly identical, so you'd be best off marking them in some manner (perhaps painting or taping the bases).

Unfortunately, when it comes to gameplay, this game seems to suffer from the pitfalls of most ""co-op"" games. There aren't any tactical decisions that benefit from teamwork, such as flanking fire, etc. The only time it really ever gets used is on the occasional teamwork-oriented card, which are rare, and overall underpowered compared to the other action cards.

The AI is controlled by its own deck, each card activating a specific class of opponent, or sometimes all opponents. Since most enemies can have up to six figures on the board and once, and an AI card is drawn at the end of every player's turn, you typically end up with five or six or more enemy actions to every player's single action. Thus the playability of the game is even worse than Pandemic's. Within just a few turns, all but the luckiest series of card draws will leave half the team taking a dirt nap, while the rest futilely try to hold back the unstoppable horde of monsters.

Part of the problem is that each player's health is equal to the cards in his or her hand (maximum six). Although you draw two at the beginning of your turn, you must spend at least one card each turn, and sometimes up to four. Want to pick up ammo, or a dropped weapon? That'll cost you a card. Revive a fallen ally? That's a card. Activate a mission objective? Yep, that's another card. Moving, firing - everything costs cards, and therefore health, and the constant drain from even just performing a turn's actions quickly outstrips the meager allowance of two per turn - and heaven help you if an enemy hits you! Even the well-named ""Wretches"" can easily strip three or four cards from a player's hand, and more powerful enemies can do much worse, and from further away!

Overall, the game is worth a few plays for interest alone, but most likely after that it will dwell untouched on the shelf. I wouldn't have purchased this game (certainly not for this price!) if I'd had a chance to try it out ahead of time. If you feel you must play it, try and see if a fellow board game enthusiast has already bought it, and try a few games with them.",3.0
"I was so excited for this but it is not as fun as i hoped it only comes with Dom,Baird,Cole,and Marcus where is carmine and hoffman?Plus there are not that many different missions where is versus?Plus where are the grenadiers,beast riders. 50 dollars for this game don't buy, the lowest i would buy this game for is 30 dollars maybe only 25 dollars. Forgot to mention you need nose plugs, when I opened the box it smelt so bad and wierd (and it still does) it gives me a headache!!",3.0
"So, they are cool magnets, indeed. But up close they seem darker in color.. Overall, not bad at all. Like.",3.0
"Infiltration was a game I was very excited about when I heard about it. I want to try out Android, but it's such an investment for such a complex sounding game that I worry that it won't be a match for my group and that it'll be too confusing. And then I saw this at my FLGS and it was a reasonable price, so I picked it up.

It's a fairly straight forward Push Your Luck game, but with a few added elements to make it more interesting. Players start with a small hand of cards, and cards are very hard to get. There are a few rooms that let you draw cards, but for the most part you're going to be playing with what you have in hand. Everyone is trying to get information chips out of the rooms of the building and then get out, which is harder than it sounds.

The tough part about this game is that the Data Chips that are Victory Points are dealt out randomly. A room gets a certain number of VP chips on it when it's revealed, but they might all be 1s or they might all be 3s, and there's no way of knowing until you've drawn it. And some actions from other players make you randomly discard a VP chip, so again you might end up with getting rid of a 1 or a 3, and there's no way to control that loss.

Overall I liked the game. It wasn't as good as I was hoping for it to be, but it was still pretty good. My gaming group however really disliked it. Too Random was the complaint I heard the most.",3.0
"This product is a great concept but is poorly executed.  I like that the box is a ""hard"" plastic versus the soft/bendable material that many of the other brands are made from.  My biggest problem is that the clear plastic panel that is supposed to hold the exterior card in place does not stay on very well.  The design is nice but the fit just isn't quite rite.  The box is great to store your deck but I wouldn't put a card in the exterior display space unless you were confortable with that card potentially falling out.",3.0
This does not have enough sleeves for one box of Catan Rivals. But quality of plastic is good.,3.0
"Our family loves the game, but had I understood this was a 'mass market edition' I would have purchased the more expensive (about $10 more) version, which is so much more user friendly. As just one example, while this mme has little cubes you push on your board to score (don't bump it or all is lost!) the regular, better version has pegs you stick in holes which are sturdy and withstand a little movement or accidental table bumping. The game is awesome, but it's not worth it to buy the mass market edition. Spend more and get better quality.",3.0

"Originally, I rated this game much higher. My husband and I purchased it since we're constantly searching for good two player board/card games. It's a beast to learn, taking a least an hour or two to really get it down. I highly recommend the videos Fantasy Flight published online. They are very helpful to give a clearer picture of the rules. My husband is a weirdo and loves to spend hours reading through the manual. If you're like me and what a quick guide, the online videos make this game much more accessible. That being said, the game wasn't totally for us. It's highly competitive and not a game we found we could casually play without breaking out into strategic sweats. The game play is fantastic and different than your average two play card game, which we did love about it. One player is the ""corporation"" while another is the ""hacker."" The two roles are extremely different and for once we didn't feel like we were just playing another card game along the lines of Magic the Gathering. However, the game is so complicated we couldn't pick it up every once and a while to play, we felt like we had to completely relearn the rules every time (thank goodness for those online videos) but its so competitive its one we'd really only enjoy once in a blue moon. Because of this, its sat on our shelf gathering way too much dust. If you're looking for a high quality, competitive, well flushed out two player game than this is for you. However, if you're looking for a game to sip ice tea and relax with, maybe look somewhere else.",3.0
Sorry.  This was a gift so no opinion.,3.0
"Bought this after playing with a friend. It's a fun game, but extremely complicated. Having read through the instruction manual (novel?!) I still don't quite feel comfortable trying to explain how to play this to someone who has never played it before.

The real challenge is getting to play this. Since it is only a 2 player game, you have to have only 1 other person who can play. But since I see gaming as a social experience, I'm usually in larger groups.

It's an amazing game, I just done think I'm going to get to play it much. I'm already thinking about selling it.",3.0
"This resource is very helpful if you are looking to ""fill in"" your Star Wars universe. It is VERY WELL produced, as usual for FFG products. My problem with the material is the basic problem I am having with all of the Edge of the Empire material: small potatoes. They seem obsessed with races (Swoop or cloud car) and card games or exploring or big game hunting. Is FFG trying to keep high stakes sessions reserved for the following core sets? Sure seems that way. Either that or they have lost their creativity (this seems unlikely). I feel like they are stuck in a box where they don't want to give your campaign anything too important to do. Kind of wish they would come out with a supplement with ""Big NPC's"" or consequential adventure seeds. Anyway, this book is a good early resource but hoping to see some more ""umph"" in future products.",3.0
"The game itself is great, and it's a great value (especially with the dice) but it's a little less substantial than I'd hoped. Physically, the box it all comes in is thin card stock that's worthless for storage, and the stuff inside isn't quite up to Fantasy Flight's normal level of quality (probably some corners were cut to be able to include the dice). The rules are also less substantial than a lot of beginner games; they're plainly designed to run the included adventure and nothing more. There's nothing about creating new characters or advancing the included ones beyond the context of the adventure. If you're not sure about Edge of the Empire, the Beginner Game is worth getting at its price point, but if you're already a Star Wars or RPG fan, just go straight to the Core Rulebook.",3.0
"I enjoy Netrunner, but I don't enjoy it as much as I enjoy Magic the Gathering. It is a different game that doesn't appeal to me. However, it has several strengths over MtG that enjoy. Notably, it is far cheaper to get into, and play at a competitive level than MtG.

Ultimately, I plan on selling Netrunner. I already have to other collectible games I enjoy more, MtG and Star Wars X-Wing The Miniatures Game, so my need for fun collectible games is filled.",3.0
I was really looking forward to getting into a card game again and I thought this would do that. The reviews for the game are great. It just didn't live up to what I thought. I normally like things just because they are complicated but this game seemed over complicated. I wish the card art was a little better and that the cards had a bit more variety. I'm sure the variety comes in the expansions but that's lame.,3.0
"Compared to the original card game, this version is a disappointing shadow.  It feels like a game designed to play it safe, so afraid of hitting a broken game mechanic that it abandoned all the interesting properties of the original.  Much of the fun of the original was in unusual cards that manipulated actions, runs, and icebreaking, but this new version has very few cards that deviate from the base game mechanics.  And in deck construction, the new ""influence"" mechanic severely limits deck variety and flavor.",3.0
"It's definitely a great game with a lot of depth.  It's complex and engaging however it is very demanding at the same time.  It can be a little too heavy at times which is why I kind of lost interest at the moment.  Furthermore to really get the most out of the game you gotta deck build and to do that you gotta buy a whole bunch of expansions.  Understandable on their end why they did it but I'm just not interested in investing more money into this game.

One more thing, as people will have already mentioned, finding opponents can be difficult.

it's a good game but just know what you are getting yourself into.",3.0
"Though this comes in the same box as other board games, it is a card game. They could just ship you 2 deck boxes full of cards. If you love MtG then you'll probably love this. If you're not looking to follow the game, buy expansions, and build decks to play, then you probably won't be that into this game",3.0

"For starters, I'm not a beginning gamer. I've been playing for a few of years now through six or seven different systems. I was expecting a complete rule book with an introductory adventure, but got an adventure and rule book intended for someone who's never played an RPG ever. The rule book is set up for adjudicating the included adventure, not giving guidelines for creating your own adventures. There are no character creation rules, either for PC's or NPC's.
That being said, it accomplishes the purpose it was intended for (I found out after reading one of the included leaflets). It would be very easy for someone new to role playing to pick up this game and get started quickly. The character portfolios are nice, full-color and do a good job of laying out character progression (again for someone who's never played before). Having tokens to represent characters works just fine and gives a good feel for moving around an area. The included dice are great and after using them for a short time everyone got the hang of reading them.
Everything is well laid out, easy to read and figure out. Beginners should have no problem using this product.",3.0

"OK so my wife and I love game of thrones and we had to have this collectible. I am SUPER disapointed. It always seems with collectibles that the face is what is always messed up.

If a character figure can't match the face at all then what's the point? I'm a huge collector of figures and statue replicas of movie, tv, and comic book characters and this has been the biggest let down because by looking at the face, I have no clue who she is.",3.0
"It's an ok game, with interesting mechanics, but it's two-player only, and a rehash of an old CCG.  It's still sound, but some streamlining of things could've helped.",3.0

"The Netrunner card game has been reprinted by FFG and called Android: Netrunner.  I ordered one immediately since I've waited a long time for this game to breathe new life.
However this has fallen a bit short of expectation.  The good part is the game mechanics are almost identical to the original and there are some old favorites in runner and corp cards.
The bad is that the artwork is in most cases not as cool as the original cards.  Granted you can't improve much on corp cards like homewrecker or liche, but the new set could still benefit from more imagination.  And if they couldn't then include some original art or recommission the old concepts with a new angle.
The second point is the card stock itself is somewhat weak and flimsy, definitely not as durable as the original netrunner cards which implies mandatory sleeves.  But as CCG players we prefer to choose whether to use sleeves or not;  And even in the case we do the card itself needs some strength to it if it is to fill out a sleeve correctly.  Also the cards themselves are matte and not gloss protected, exacerbating the 'cheap' feel of the product.
A third thought is the symbol for 'bits' looks like an action and vice versa.  I will inevitably become comfortable with it but it's an observation to note.
Lastly the counters are all cardboard, which is fine and I knew what to expect on that however for the price at least glass 'bit' counters could be included; Yet this would have been along the lines of stronger card stock.  The box the set itself comes in seems to be a waste of space.  I can only guess that it is to preempt the inclusion of expansions in a centralized container if and when the game grows in time.
I personally would have paid 25% more for the product if it would correlate to a higher quality when finished.  Still going to play the game of course, but in holding the original Netrunner in such high regard I expected a better realization.",3.0

"From a crunch standpoint, if you were looking to buy it you've already researched it's pilots and cards so I won't waste your time with a review that tells you what you already know. It's good enough there even with the rest it gets a 3 not a 1 or 2. From a fluff/model standpoint, this is easily the poorest of all FFG's production runs I've seen and I own 85+% of all the X Wing game line. Minor but noticeable errors in the model are common, asymmetry where their shouldn't be, etc. Also I've yet to buy one from any source that didn't have more issues with it's base/attachment point than any other X-Wing ship. Not a horrible product as a whole, some good cards, interesting rules, neat named pilots, definitely a decent ATF for the Rebels, but the model itself... I almost returned the one Amazon sent me (always double check the models Amazon sends, you can't inspect them like you could at a store), on a 1-10 quality of model scale where 10 is I love and 1 is I loathe, it's a 5 even (and most X-Wing products are 7+).",3.0
"The E-Wing came with a bent forward antenna and took significant modification to get it straight. Afterwards it was so weak it eventually broke just with normal handling. Otherwise, the paint job is excellent quality (for the price), and included all the specified cards, dial, etc.  Another fine X-Wing mini overall.",3.0
"Is a nice collection toy, but the face is not as real as un the picture",3.0
"As another review said, The face is a bit thinner than in the photos and that does take away from the figure quite a bit in my opinion. Remember that to be a good figure means you have to have a flawless design. I do like how the dragon eggs and the chest are their own separate objects and that you can have the figure hold whatever egg you want while the other eggs fit well in the chest, which can be set next to her. That was a plus in my opinion.

Overall, The thinner face takes away from the figure a bit but as a whole, It's certainly worth checking out but mind you that you'd want to see a few real photos of other figures before making a final decision on buying. If I would have gotten for a bit cheaper price, I wouldn't mind picking it up.",3.0
"The Transport is a fun expansion to the core game, but it comes at a pretty high price.  I play with my girlfriend, and we tried out a couple of the new modes.  They are fun, but we found ourselves going right back to the basic game.  The model is extremely detailed and looks fantastic, but one of the engines on mine came broken off.  Amazon took care of me though.",3.0
"Pro... Also comes with an X wing, some great t65 X wing pilots (Hobbie, Wes!, and Tarn esp.), what looks like a unique paint scheme on the X Wing, and a slew of astromechs (many used in popular builds), the transport was well painted even at factory.
[tips... Try pairing Tarn with a certain astromech from the Ewing expansion, try Hobbie with the astromech that gives he and his target stress [his power lets him clear immediately if he uses it], and Wes... holy Force push his power helps buddies who fire later [and veteran instinct or adaptability can help him fire before other elites like, say, Wedge...]

Cons... One of the worst models, referring to the transport, in terms of quality of the base junction holes (mine was just barely playable, my friend had to return a few months ago as well so it may be a factory issue), the X wing, while uniquely painted, had bad paint fading in places.

Overall... By itself, the Transport model was a bit upsetting but the set as a whole? Almost (absolutely) a must if you want to get the most out of original trilogy X Wings. Despite the Cons, it's still a solid buy for its cost for those pilots and astromechs that come from no other source. I don't know anyone who's paid 40 or less for it that didn't feel it was worth it in the end.",3.0

"This is a review of both Wiz-War & Fantasy Flight. Wiz-War gets 5 stars: It is an excellent game. Competitive, strategic (but not overly so) & fun. Note that the picture above is not the edition that ships. One of the aspects I enjoy most is that in every game I have played has been very close - which makes it enjoyable even if you lose.
Fantasy Flight gets 1 star. This is a long story so bear with me... After playing once, I borrowed this game from a friend & my dog decided to investigate some of the pieces - leaving tooth marks. My wife called the number in the book & they told her to use the web request. I contacted Fantasy Flight customer support using the web request & they ignored me - completely. I have never heard back from them on that issue.
After the first several days, I decided to skip the replacement parts route & just get the game - I can replace my friend's pieces with the new ones & I will use the slightly damaged pieces myself. Problem solved - right? Wrong.
The new game came with a broken piece (once of the wizards missing an arm). I filled out the same request I had before & this time customer support got back to me: I need to create another new service ticket - which i did. And a week later, I still have not heard anything back.
So, in conclusion: Wiz-war is excellent. Fantasy Flight customer support is pathetic.",3.0

"I won't lie, I bought this for the x2 Autothrusters upgrades. The ship itself is far over costep for what it does, an her unique pilots don't bring much to the table. I'm personally a Rebel flyer so this doesn't fit in much, but my coworker only runs scum and refuses to fly this.

Great ship model though!",3.0
This is not a ship you will fly in game unless there is a special format.  It's over costed and fragile.  The upgrade cards are excellent.  Autothrusters are fantastic and 2 of them on ebay currently cost about as much as this ship new in box.  So if you're a serious X Wing player just think of the ship as coming free with your 2 copies of autothrusters.,3.0

"They're dice and are of a nice solid weight. Feels good to roll a fist full of them. I'd say the main problem is the set is about one die short of each kind that you'd use in a typical game, which if you'd rather roll all the dice at once necessitates two sets just to get that extra needed die. This is obviously by design. If there were one more of each die type, most people would be happy with just one set. You really should have two sets to feel like you've got the right amount of dice to play.",3.0
"I hate that you have to buy these dice to play the game. Amazon has the best price I have found. Gaming shops are always out of these dice.
It's a ridiculous thing to create separate dice for your system, and then not produce enough of them to meet the demand. So the dice are good, the price is good, but Fantasy Flight Games is profit hungry.",3.0

Nice dice and good quality from FFG of course. We found ourselves rerolling some of these to get the dice pools we needed. We have just started playing so of course at some point we will probably have to buy two sets. Some people take issue with 'special dice' needed for certain roleplaying games. I'm not one of those people.. however it is unfortunate that to build dice pools and get everything in one roll you will need two sets of these.,3.0
I wish there were more dice per pack. One pack barely covers a group of 4+GM.,3.0
I was disappointed because I bought the dice and then read the core rule book. You need quite a bit more dice to play the game and at $14 per package of dice it can get expensive. The quality was OK but for the price you'd think the quality would be more than that of the dice you'd find in a Monopoly game.,3.0

"Arkham Horror had become a ""dolls house"" game by the time this was put out, with people (me included) queuing up to buy the latest expansion (sometimes twice if early adoption produced poor rules).

Well, thank Azathoth Itself this was the last expansion for the game because FFG would have gotten no more money from me afterward anyway.

My own fault in a way, because I pre-ordered it based on the fact it was a new expansion and the box was one of the big ones. I was expecting a board-based expansion.

Yes there are a lot of cards in the box, but most of them have such specific prerequisites that you'll only usually be playing with a fraction of them (unless I've completely misunderstood the purpose).

The box is the same size as the ""board"" expansions, but could have been an Elder Sign sized one as most of the internal space is air. I opened mine in front of my LFGS owner and we both just stared and said ""What the...""

The cards are beautiful, the usual high quality affair and that does cost to put in front of people, but the fact is that each of the subsets of these cards could have been made available for those who felt the need at a fraction of the cost of the full ""one-size fits nobody"" version, maybe in sachet packaging.

My overall feeling was that I'd been royally taken and I decided right there that I'd not buy anything else from this game series again.

I also question the utility of cards that can only be used if more than one expansion is used, since adding two extra boards to the basic set would require something the size of an English billiard table to accommodate, a footprint I doubt very many can achieve in the home. I stand ready to be contradicted.

Your mileage will certainly vary, of course, and if you've exhausted the possibilities of AH, AH+DH, AH+IH, AH+KH, AH+DH+IH, AH ...... AH+IH+KH+TBGOOW+TLATT+TCOTDP+TKIY then you have no other choice but to either buy this box and double your options or to play a different game altogether.",3.0

"I can not really comment on this game because it is SUPER DIFFICULT! I tried to figure out how to play this after plaything the video game extensively. I'm sure once you get the hang of this game it would be challenging, but following the game is super difficult.

To start off the cards are not really defined well. you kind of have to figure it all out by yourself. You follow an App on a mobile device (mine on Ipad). The game moves very quickly even in the demo and super hard to figure out. My son and I gave up. he gave up first after 40 minutes and me after 2 hours. The quick movement of the game is to force you to make decisions quickly, which is good, but there should be better demonstrations to explain palying in this set.

I'm sure I could go to Youtube, and I'm sure I will end up going there but I do not feel it should be a requirement.

Just to clarify, I am a 40 year old male with 2 college degrees. I work in the medical field and have have worked in many ""Code Blue"" hospital situations. This game is more complex than bringing a person back to life. that may be good in the end, but makes it hard to have fun. This is not a game you will be able to just sit and play.

I didn't go through the adventure much but it does have a few NPCs you can steal from it for your own sessions.",3.0
"I bought this as my first GM accessories. It seems of impressive quality, I'm happy about that. I feel some of the space on the screen is wasted. Particularly, an entirely large chart for 0-150 rolls for critical injuries on persons, and another for vehicles. Those seem largely unnecessary to me.

What I was really hoping for was a quicker way to look up what skills someone is trying to use, and what counters them. For example, if a character is trying to charm a PC, what skill does the NPC use to defend it? That is way more needed for me, and instead I'll have to print that out and have it with me or tape it to the screen.

For just that reason I really felt it wasn't worth the money, as hard as that seems. The rest of the info found on it is nice, but it's relatively easy to remember (more purple dice means the check is harder) or look up.",3.0

"The Star Wars Edge of the Empire Game Master's Kit is a fine addition to any GM's toy box, but is a bit mislabeled - what you are purchasing is actually a heavy cardboard GM's Screen and a 30 page magazine-style booklet.

The adventure was an interesting but not truly dazzling work involving Hutts and droids; the Nemesis section I've so far found useless. The GM screen is extremely sturdy, and displays basic tables from the core rulebook on the four different partition sections. That pretty much sums up the product.

So, for a recommended retail price of $19.99 + tax, you get a sturdy GM screen, a short adventure, and a few pages of explanations for GMs only. To me, this wasn't worth the price - I'd rather buy a cheaper partition (maybe from an office supply story; maybe just use a GM screen from a different game) and spend the rest of my money on another Edge of The Empire product (perhaps a full adventure book like _The Jewel of Yavin_; something with adventure hooks and source material like _Suns of Fortune_; or maybe one of the career ""splatbooks"" like _Dangerous Covenants_).

"Great artwork, great cards! However once you begin battling you will immediately notice an imbalance between the decks. The princess bubblegum deck is a good well built deck, but the Lumpy Space Princess deck is nigh worthless the deck uses both blue plains and useless swamp lands and the strategy is to balance out replacing cards on blue plains and discarding cards on useless swamp. This does not work at all because you do not draw enough cards. Your only hope to win is draw fatapillar and mausoleum and keep them until you have around 25-30 cards in your discard pile, you will usually be 3/4 dead and out of cards in your hand by this point unless if you were lucky enough to also draw the one strengthening crystal in your deck. This whole issue is important because if Crytozoic is trying to sell it's customers on a card dueling game outfitting the boxes with unbalanced decks shows they failed at one of the most important facets of making a card game, and that is not a good sign this early in the games lifespan.",3.0
"I enjoy playing the game, and the three stars isn't a review of the game. The game is fun!

However, the LSP deck is way underpowered compared to the PB deck. I've played these decks against each other some two dozen times, and the LSP deck was victorious only once. Oh my glob! The LSP deck is weak because it has a lot of 2-action creatures, which means more often having undefended landscapes. The creatures have no high attack power without discarding, but drawing only one card per turn, there's not enough to discard. The blue plains creatures and goats are meant to provide additional cards, but it's more common that they fill in these undefended gaps than replace other creatures.

Meanwhile, the PB deck is really well built. There are six creature cards that heal the player in addition to a bunch of creatures that heal other creatures. Many of the cards cost 0 or 1 action and have high defense. It's a great defensive barrier that powers up quickly with spells to take advantage of the undefended territory in the LSP deck.

I wish the LSP deck were better balanced. It needs a spell or creatures/buildings to floop to draw more cards at the cost of 1 instead of 2, and creatures with higher defenses. The powerhouse of the deck, the Fatapillar, has a weak defense of only 3. The mausoleum is meant to boost this, but it's not common to get both cards at once *while* the discard pile is large.

The PB deck is great, though!",3.0

"This is a hidden information game.  Each player is a ninja clan attempting to either assassinate or guard certain targets.  At the start of each round 3-4 targets are placed in the center of the play area with rewards underneath each one for guarding or assassinating them.  Each player in secret chooses two contracts, either to assassinate or guard 2 of those targets.  Then there is a drafting phase where players select the cards they will play that round.  Then the play phase when players will play these cards face down on the different targets.

There are some nuances to this that give players the ability to bluff.  All characters whether they are guardians, assassins, or characters that do special abilities or change the value of the contracts are played face down.  There are also events that happen immediately, weapons that must be played on the guardian or assassin side (but there are still some weapons that only WORK for one side so placing it on the other can still be a way for a player to bluff), and many of the special abilities can do things like remove or reveal other cards.

The resolution of each round is simple, the side with the most power wins and players who chose that contract get a pay out.  This is another place where decisions can be made, the valuable contracts may be selected by multiple players and you have to split the reward so choosing a less valuable contract may mean a larger reward if you were the only one who picked it.

The ideas here are neat and it all works really well.  Hidden information games for me, though, are all about how much you can play with the system.  Here I don't feel like there is a lot I can do.  Players have a contract and their most valuable cards are going to, more often than not, just be played to secure they achieve their contracts.  Not many cards are going to be played in an attempt to trick or bluff other players.  In the end it just becomes kind of a game about playing the right cards at the right time to win the contracts but that kind of takes some of the wind out of the sails, I want hidden information games to have good hidden information mechanics.

Also, I have to point out that the cards are hideous.  The art is ugly, and not just in a ""style that I don't like"" kind of way, it's just bad.  The text on the cards is just as bad and very difficult to read.  The actual effect text is done in a different, easy to read, font and just the actual names of the cards are in the hard to read flourishes so this is a minor thing but it still increases the ugly factor of the game.",3.0

"UPDATED

Presumably anyone buying this game is into the HBO series, so the idea of interacting as a clan or characters in the show (via card game) is a pretty cool one. My wife and I, having played some more complex games like Pandemic (which realistically are more geared towards the thought process of teenagers and adults, not kids), were excited to try this. While we're going to keep at it, the reality is unless you already have experience playing games like Magic the Gathering, the framework and rules of this game are more complicated than they need to be.

It's a very nicely illustrated game and of course a lot of thought went into the rules, but herein lies the rub: it was over-thought IMHO. There are too many variables and contingent variables for most gamers who aren't used to totally nerding out, memorizing the cards for fun, etc. Here's what a typical gamer (so we'll say someone beyond the world of Monopoly, but also not at the level of someone who plays Magic  basically someone in the middle of the continuum with skills and patience to match) goes through when they open the box.

1) Greeted by the fact that there is a starter manual and a second more detailed reference manual.

The manuals themselves are well-written and nicely laid out so there's no issue there  I write technical materials for a living so this is second nature to me. However this triple manual setup is telling. If as a designer you can't tell the story of your game and how the characters and pieces interact, using a combination of copy and illustrations and photos, in ~ 10 pages or less, you need to specify very clearly on the box that this is for advanced gamers. Because virtually everyone else (which is a large majority) is going ot struggle with it for a while.

2) Realize you are going to half to play a couple of walk-through joust matches just to get the basic sequencing of moves and options.

3) Checking reviews, you come to understand the developer, in an effort to help people out, has made a 17 minute video online.

4) Everyone warning you to be patient, despite all these resources.

All of this put together = a game that is more complicated than it needs to be. There are too many variables and too many rules exceptions. This isn't D&D where the Dungeon Master is expected to improvise and make up scenarios as you go. :)

[LATER COMMENTS
After walking through a few ""demo games"" and setups, I think the real problems with this game  which are easily remedied  are these:

1) Add more illustrations of card setups (in the tutorial) at various points in the game. In the tutorial, right after it's described how to set up the cards, the illustration shows something else instead  what a player's setup might look like mid-game. This is confusing. It should show exactly the standard setup right after the Plot cards have been turned. That way people know exactly how the table should look before the first players are Marshalled. Then show illustrations from the middle of the game, in the context of whatever instruction you're showing (how to resolve a specific challenge, etc).

2)  There are certain plot cards, event cards, and others which state a benefit to using the card but are unclear as to when they get used or they conflict / aren't mentioned in the progression of the tutorial or reference. IMO these are the card types that should be included:

 Plot - OK but unclear in their instructions in some cases (see below)
 Characters - OK
 Attachments - OK
 Title - Meh... but OK
Scenarios (include what are now locations, events, and one other thing I can't recall off the top)

For any of the card types that carry special rules or powers, they need to be explained more clearly. Like this:

""Road to Wherever"" / ""Event X""

Power: This card let's you pick one kneeling player and  ____ with it
When: the kneeling player can only perform this action when ____ has happened. Until then, leave it kneeling.
Exception: this card can't be used against ____.

A simple re-configuration of how the card's abilities are described would resolve nearly all of the confusion that is caused by the game. To say as one commenter did (and I really don't get the negative reaction to my 3 Start review) ""well this is for serious gamers so (inferred) it doesn't really matter of anyone else is confused by it because serious gamers wouldn't be"" is pretty absurd. Are people BORN serious gamers or do they have to get there through experience? What if people choose this game as their gateway? :) It's more confusing / convoluted than it needs to be for those people. Do you want to frustrate those people or bring them into the gaming realm? Seems obvious which the better choice is. You can make a game intricate without making it confusing.

Simple suggestions like those above would make the game much more playable from the early going, without losing any intrigue (pun not intended) or replayability. This is not suggesting a dumbed down version or a version that doesn't make you think it is suggesting simplifying things that aren't written or illustrated clearly, and reducing the number of categories so the card types are easier to remember in total. :)",3.0

Interesting experiments, that are all in one place - but these are nothing new and can all be found on the internet easily. A good gift for a 6-10 year old who is interested in experiments.",3.0
My son was disappointed at the fact there is only one small light stick when the cover shows to light sticks battling each other.  The cover of the box shows light sticks that look about 12 inches long when the real product is only about 5 or 6 inches.,3.0

"Some of these are simply not analogies.

"Fun game. I've always loved time travel and the concept behind this game is quite clever. The solo gameplay feels a little broken because I played it and lost the game after two cards (I reshuffled one back into the deck so I wouldn't lose after two cards). Even regular gameplay (played one 2-person game) seemed like it might be hard to win sometimescertain game winning conditions require one card to win. Luckily there are a few ""search through the deck"" type of cards which can help.",3.0
"I actually find this game to be pretty complicated. I know games like Fluxx usually have the straight forward instructions, but I got lost in the specifications in a lot of the situations. I must be honest and say that I have only attempted this once and by myself so far, so my review may be a bit shallow. I'll edit as I become more familiar with the game, but considering I'm a big fan of Fluxx, this was a bit of a miss for me.",3.0
"It's Fluxx with a time travel theme.  I guess that's not quite fair because I actually like this a little more than Fluxx because I really like games with hidden agendas/secret goals.  In Chrononauts you are given a secret identity and mission, fulfilling either of which will win you the game.  Then the rest of the game plays out a lot like Fluxx.  The humor on the cards is legitimately funny as well.",3.0
"Its not a game you can jump right into like story wars or cards against humanity, its got a really clear order of rules and if you mess them up even a little the whole game is thrown off. However, when played right its incredibly fun.",3.0
Kind of an odd setup for a card game,3.0
"I love the game Fluxx and this was the 5th version of the game I purchased. I was happy with the cards and the game, but I was disappointed to a receive the product with a large pink neon sticker attached to the cover of the box lid that says ""Product Demo"". I attempted to peel the sticker off the lid and damaged the image. While this has no impact on the game, it made me sad to see I have damaged the box--as I like to keep my games in good condition. I looked back through the product description and no where did it say that there would be a ""Product Demo"" sticker on the lid. I would suggest that you note this in the description as it was highly disappointing to me.",3.0
"My brother-in-law is a huge game fanatic and also a Monty Python fanatic. He introduced us to Monty Python Fluxx. My husband and I are both Monty Python fans but our kids are not there yet. They played this game with us but didn't really ""get it"". For me, it was just ""ok"". I was sold on the concept - enough that I bought my son Zombie Fluxx for Christmas and have actually looked at a couple of the other games - but even though I know and love Monty Python humor, this game really didn't do much for me. When we all get together, I always find myself hoping we'll play Zombie Fluxx instead of Monty Python.",3.0
"although chaotic, gameplay gets a bit repetitive after several tries.",3.0
"If you would advertise yourself as a huge month python fan this game is for you,
also if you play regularly with other huge MP fans then this game is for you.

Otherwise its hard to play because most people don't get the references. I would
recommend to the majority of people to choose a broader topic version of Fluxx,
like Pirates or Zombies or the Original.",3.0
There are many versions of fluxx and this one is pretty good.  It's funny since its themed to Monty Python.  The game itself isn't the best but it isn't bad either.  There are many other card games out there that are much better.,3.0
"I love fluxx, but am wishing i bought the pirate one instead. Its hard to get folks to play this one unless they've seen the movie. A more general fluxx (pirates, regular, space etc) might have been a better choice for my group of gaming friends.

My Monty Python fan of a dad enjoyed playing it with us, and its not a bad game. I just think the other decks are better.",3.0
"I love Fluxx.  We play all the different versions all the time.  This is the least creative.  I'm a huge Monty Python fan and that was so much more they could have done with it.  After playing one or two times, it's boring.",3.0
"If you are familiar with other Fluxx games then you will understand this one easily enough. This game includes Creepers, much like the Zombie version, so that's an added component. Otherwise it is like any other Fluxx game, except that it is Monty Python themed. That being said, it actually encourages a lot of Monty Python-esque imitations and silly voices that can be fun in the right setting with the right people, and most likely the right amount of alcohol. The rest of the time you are just taking turns being annoying with the Monty Python quotes and imitations. Not really a good two player game either. You really need a group of people for this one. We play the Zombie Fluxx a lot and tend to prefer it for two players over this one. Otherwise this is a pretty good game.",3.0
"This is officialiy the weirdest game I have ever encountered. But it can be a very fun game. Fluxx is a card game that ever changing rule and goals. Most of this game is based on the luck of the draw. The Fluxx card game has many different versions you can buy and one of them is the Monty Python version. There are some great quotes and artistic depictions of the Monty Python movies included in the game. It mostly refers to the Monty Python and the Holy Grail movie. So if you like Monty Python, you don't mind a game that has ever changing rules and goals, and you like luck, then you will probably love this game.",3.0
"The game, albeit intentionally so, gets rather silly rather quickly.  Better be a hardcore Python fan or in the mood for the wacky level of Fluxx to triple if you want to play this.",3.0
"I thought that this expansion pack did add to the basic Chrononauts game.  Having played it both with and without, however, the difference isn't huge.  I bought this product as a gift along with the basic pack and with the extra identities expansion, and I thought that worked out pretty well.  For a fairly reasonable price, you can add on to the original game, and it makes a complete package as a gift for a game-player.",3.0
"This is a fun little ""filler"" game, but in my opinion Eco the least enjoyable of the Fluxx themes. Still, it's pretty good and also proceeds go to a good cause. Win-win!",3.0

"Having played Bananagrams with friends, I was expecting a simular quality from Amazon. Unfortunately, this one was very cheaply made. The tiles for the game I experienced were lovely. The ones I received were cheap looking and feeling. The underside of the tiles were hollowed out. I would not give it to my granddaughter for Christmas, so I bought another Bananagrams game for her from Target. As a result, I will use the cheap, crappy one as a house game.",3.0

"We are big Bananagram players and I have bought a single bananas game and a double one, both at Barnes & Noble.  Not sure if they are making it different now it but this most recent game the little tiles are very light weight and seem more cheaply made.

You can commit to a game or 2 without taking an hour.  I was disappointed with the tiles in this order.  The games that I have played before had smooth tiles with a little weight to them.  These tiles feel cheap and are very light.  They have an indentation in the back that makes them feel very flimsy to me.  It still plays the same, but I feel like I got a ""knock off"" version in the tiles.",3.0

"The tiles from an earlier version of the game were solid plastic and more like the tiles in versions of the game ""Scrabble"" that I remember.  These tiles were hollowed out in the back so they are lighter, use less material and have a different feel.  Still, it is a great game.  Wish I had thought of it.",3.0
"We've got all the ""10 Days In..."" Board games, and in general, we LOVE the games! This one, however, falls short of their usual quality mark.

The Cons:
1. There aren't enough tiles. While in the other games, there are enough tiles for 4 people to play and still have a large ""draw"" pile, when 4 people play this game, there's a tiny ""draw"" pile.
2. The game is biased towards the Caribbean Islands: each island has its own tile, and since there are so many of them, everyone ends up trying to make a trip through the Caribbean, instead of focusing on the North and South continents.
3. There aren't enough duplicate tiles. In most of the other games, the ""big"" countries have 2 tiles, but only Brazil has 2 tiles in this version. This adds to the bias towards the Caribbean: if there were 2 tiles for the USA, Canada, Mexico, and maybe a couple other South American countries, game play would be more balanced and add the necessary tiles to make the game do-able.

The Pros:
1. My kids have learned a lot about the Caribbean Islands!",3.0
"The number of magnet words included with this kit is a little overwhelming, and I find myself trying to figure out how to arrange them.  There is only one example of a saying on the front of the box, and it would have been helpful if there had been additional examples included with the kit as a starting point.

The magnets themselves seem to be good quality, and the writing is clear and consistent.  My only issue is the box they come in - while it is very pretty, the box's window is not covered with anything (the front of the box is actually a lift-up flap), so the magnets fall right out if you try to store them!  I ended up cutting the piece of hard plastic that initially contains the magnets and taped it to the inside of the box, but I shouldn't have had to do that.

I would have given this set a 5 star if there had been examples of sayings provided and if the box (which really is quite pretty) had been suited to store the pieces in.",3.0
"I recently bought bananagrams because I played it at my friend's place. The one I played with at my friend's place had ceramic, weighty tiles...they were really high quality. So I decided to buy myself a copy and found it on amazon, but I don't know if its a newer edition, but when I received mine today the tiles inside were all cheap plastic tiles..with big circle holes on the back. I was disappointed because of the downgrade..but its essentially the same game. Either they downgraded all their new editions or the seller was selling cheap imitation ones. The price wasn't even cheaper on amazon! It's the same price as I saw in stores. I had a little suspicion because there were no trademarks on the bag, tag, or insert. :/",3.0

"I ordered this item assuming it was the Real Bananagrams. I was sent a cheaper ""take-off"" of the real Bananagrams game. There was no trademark for the game on the storage bag - which the original version of the game has. I compared the true Bananagrams at a local toy store and the version I was sold here was a cheaper take-off on the real product. The storage bag was cheap, thin material with lose threads. The true version of this game has a nice quality storage bag with the trademark on the bag.

The instructions actually had words that were spelled incorrectly - funny as this game is about spelling.

Just beware you might receive a cheaper ""take-off"" version of this game when ordering from this supplier.

Disappointing and also dishonnest to sell it this way.",3.0
"This is a fun and addictive game. When last in a hospital, I played for hours with my co-patients.  That said, if you have access to a set of Scrabble tiles, you have all you need to play the game, and it is much less expensive.  When we learned the game, it was with Scrabble tiles, and we called it Take-One. If you love words, you will love the game.",3.0
"This product appears to simply be official packaging for a game we've been calling ""Speed Scrabble"" for years.  Just ditch the Scrabble board and use the letters.  Each time a player finishes using all the letters he's drawn, he yells ""Draw 2!"" and everyone takes two more tiles.  The first person to use up all tiles wins.  Scoring is negative: just add up the values of everyone's left-over tiles, like at the end of Scrabble.
For three or more people, it does help to have two sets of tiles, of course.",3.0

The microscope itself is way smaller than I expected and just plastic.  My son likes it better off the stand to look at the fibers on the couch or the lines in his skin.  I also hoped this would be fun for a smart 4 year old with great fine motor skills and a high interest in science.  Perhaps I should have listened to the age recommendation.

"I had such high hopes for this but alas none of my children were very interested. It does seem very well made, realistic, and could be very educational if I had more time to sit down with them and play with it together.  The only issue I have is that it is not a quick task to put all the parts back in the body when you just want to clean up. You have to get it all correct or it doesn't shut. Would be better it came with a separate box to store the parts in for quick cleanup.",3.0
"It was ok. Only major thing was the quality of the clear plastic outer case and the inner items snapping back in.  Good luck trying to get it all back in and snapped in. I just gave up. Would have been cool to display in my child's room, but we couldn't get all pieces to snap back in and the outer plastic cased to to stay closed either.",3.0
"Fun to play with, but the way things snap into the clear ""body"" case is just plain difficult. The bones have to be pinned in just right. The clear sections have to be aligned just perfectly. And the clear part is made of hard plastic that is difficult to snap together.

It makes me not want to get it out and let the kids play with it, because snapping it back together is such a pain.",3.0
okay,3.0
"Bought this as a Christmas present for my 5yo -- he saw it on YouTube, and asked for it. He's very careful with toys, but if your child tends to be rough, this is not going to work for them. The ""body"" is very thin plastic, and the clips don't quite line up, and it is very hard to use. The bones and muscle parts, especially the skull, hand, and foot, do not clip in, so they float around.  The organs don't fit together as well as expected, and fall out when it is together on the stand. BUT, he loves it. The book is fun, and the ""organ-izer"" is neat.

A of the parts don't actually snap in when they are supposed to for example the muscle of the one arm and rib cage they don't fit in the pegs to snap in.  Other than that it's pretty neat and my son loves it but when half the pieces fall out when they are supposed to clip in it's disappointing,3.0

It's really fun but after you take the skeleton apart the first time it is very difficult to get back together and will not snap back into place,3.0
really like this except for the fact that there is NOWHERE to store the pieces.,3.0
"Wish I could totally love this toy but I don't. My daughter asked for this right before her 5th birthday. We got it for her and she immediately wanted to put it together. She had seen this toy on a video on YouTube so she already knew most of the names of the organs. The instructions and organ-izer guide were clear and helpful. The hard plastic pieces were the worst part. As another reviewer pointed out, the pegs that fit together into the clear body case are tiny, flimsy, and easily bendable or breakable. As you put in other pieces, the muscles and/or bones will easily fall or pop out of place. Then, the clear body case doesn't stay closed (I added photos to show), especially near the torso, arms, and head. We can still get the lower part to stay closed, and so we were able to get the whole thing to attach to the stand and stay upright. But it's disappointing that the whole thing doesn't stay closed all the way. The best part is probably the squishy organs. They are fun to touch and wiggle around. We already had a toob of organs (by Safari Ltd.) but they are hard non-flexible plastic, and this was a cool way to see how the various pieces fit together, especially inside the rib cage.",3.0
"This is a really great idea but we had a few issues. First, our model was missing the stomach. Second, the intestines were thin in areas and tore easily into three pieces about a half hour after the package was opened. Third, we cannot open the clear plastic casing ""skin"" to check out the leg and arm muscles even though it looks like this should be possible.  But, the biggest bummer is the missing stomach. My son still loves it and doesn't want to return it.  That's what counts for me.",3.0
Too small for preschoolers,3.0
It's a great learning toy but the clear case doesn't snap close right so it doesn't hold all the organs in place.,3.0
"I thought this would be a great addition to my after school program kids in our science center. I quickly learned the pieces are too fragile. After one week of ""operating"" on the human body with the plastic surgery tool they pulled the intestines out and broke it.

"Doesn't stay together well, but it is fun to feel the insides.",3.0
"1My son is enamored with the human body and loves this set because the squishy organs are a lot of fun.  He has been removing and replacing them almost every day since we bought it.  He is learning so much about his organs and the way the body works!  My one complaint is that the leg and arm do not fit within the clear body ""skin"" so the entire body cannot be assembled properly.  The arm and leg musculature piece is molded in such a way that it will not allow the skin case to close once the arm and leg are placed.  It does not affect the assembly of the organs, but it is frustrating not to be able to complete the body.",3.0
"As others mentioned, the casing doesnt seem durable, but the insides were cool.",3.0
"My daughter has enjoyed this, however, it is pretty cheaply made and the rib cage keeps popping off when you least expect it.",3.0
Little pieces are hard to handle and do not stay well. There are little bumps on the organs that fit into little plastic holes on the body to hold it together but it is not a good fit and it is hard to keep it all together. I love the idea but it is just a little too hard to hold together. I like the book that comes with it and the body is fun once it is together. It was very frustrating for my 7 year old and he had to have me get it together for him.,3.0
It's like a house of cards. Falls apart with handling. Good to display. Not for playing with.,3.0
I love this model so much!...except that they gave me an extra foot and they did not give me a humorus bone. Also some of the pieces don't fit together so it falls apart all over my desk,3.0
Educational toy but difficult to snap parts together.,3.0
"Good educational toy but the top cover would been little more firmer, it is not easy for kids to assemble it without confusion.",3.0
Difficult even for an adult to get the parts aligned and seated into the transparent plastic base.

This puzzle was the most difficult puzzle I ever encountered.  The ability to put pieces in more than one location made the process frustrating.  I am still trying to find my mistakes to complete the background correctly.  I would not do this puzzle again.,3.0
"This puzzle looks amazing when it's complete. The only problem is it is EXTREMELY difficult to get there. Problem is-most of the pieces fit easily together. They all are the same color, fit together and many have no distinguishing patterns like most puzzles. We tried putting the edges together about 5 times before getting it right. I've done quite a few puzzles and never have I experienced one as difficult as this. All the pieces look like you have them properly fit together, but you find out later that you were wrong. It took HOURS over the course of a month to complete it. It is going to be glued together and hung on the wall since it took so long and was so frustrating. Awesome puzzle, but definitely not a leisure time activity. It requires good lighting, extreme patience and maybe even training at Hogwarts.",3.0
"this has to be the hardest puzzle I've ever worked on. Will update my review when and IF I ever get it done! Right now I can't give it 5 stars as I am close to ruling it impossible. So far, it does not seem that the dimensions quite match the picture on the box.",3.0
"I was hoping that the puzzle actually contained more of the map, but what you see in the picture is exactly what the puzzle looks like.  You really can't see much of the map at all, and half of the puzzle is just blank space.  Fun for a Harry Potter fan, but they missed an opportunity to make a really, really cool puzzle.",3.0
"Haven't finished it yet because the pieces are so much alike in shape and coloring. Pieces that do not belong together still fit together. Not a bad puzzle, just a lot more time consuming than we realized.",3.0
"my son loves it.  It is a pretty cool toy/resource for learning, but we got the luck of the draw with a defected ""skin case"" that does not click together or into the stand.  Not so great for displaying, or for putting away at the end of the day.",3.0
"I seems to be missing a tibia and I got 2 femurs.  The product is really cool, and it works well for describing the body and body functions to kids.  it also has a good chart and book with it, that helps to make it clear what they are looking at.  It is squishy so it has that gross factor kids love, and its teaching them something.

My issues - I got two femurs and I am missing a tibia.  Also the forceps included were not the best quality and were broken by a 4 year old inside of 20 min.  The item is cool and sparked some cool conversations, it was educational as well as fun, but a little manufacturing issue hit the rating on this one.",3.0
"Very interesting to be able to see and touch all the body parts, organs, etc...  Yet, it is not as sturdy as I would have liked.  The organs fall out, the plastic case does not stay snapped securely, and one of the gray instruments used to look at the parts with already broke.  I'm sure my kids have learned from it but I got so frustrated with it, it is now in the basement.",3.0
"My daughter saw this at a local bookstore and she really wanted it.  It was right after her 6th birthday and she received lots of gifts for her birthday, so I wasn't going to buy this for her just because she wanted it.  She told me she really really wanted it, so I told her she would have to earn it.  She filled out the chore charts for the next 7 weeks to save money for this.  She worked hard and saved money, so I bought this for her (actually I ordered this on Amazon way before she saved enough money and I hid it in the closet and when she handed me her money i deposited that into her account for her future).  She was very excited when she finally got this and this is a good educational toy, I agree.  BUT some of the areas where the plastic parts are supposed to fit and make a somewhat snap sound, the holes are not aligned....  There is no way that my daughter's small hands (or my adult hands) can push it hard when the holes are not at where they are supposed to be....  She gets frustrated and so do I.  Instruction is not so good in my opinion.  There is no mention of shoulder blades and after carefully following all the directions (words and pictures), we were left with two bone pieces.  It took me a while to figure out what they were (You might think I am dumb, but I am college educated and good at following directions).  If it was up to me, i would give 1 star, but my daughter still likes to play with this, so i would give three stars.",3.0
"The concept of this item is great. My daughter purchased this as a Christmas gift for her brother. they both enjoyed exploring the parts. The problem with it is that the legs and arms don't fit very well. Also, the rubber pieces are so small that they get lost very easily.",3.0
"Not the best, not the worst.  Mostly as described, but the pieces don't fit together exactly as they are supposed to.",3.0
"The toy itself is nicely made, but my kids got bored by it the minute after opening it.
The provided case does not close properly from the beginning, so it probably is handy that no one is playing with it.",3.0
The parts do not click into place very well.  I love the idea of this product but quality is lacking.,3.0
"I gave it as an Xmas gift to an 8-year-old, and he put it together in 10 mins and lost interest.  Maybe it's just him.",3.0
"got this for a relatives little girl, she didn't think it was a girly enough gift",3.0
"Really cool idea - my 9 year old nephew loved the squishy organs and reading about the human body. Unfortunately the muscles in the leg won't snap into place. I wanted him to be able to display it in his room, but it looks like it won't get finished.",3.0
"Even though this toy arrived broken (the outter human shell was cracked and the needle tongs were broken)... my son still loves this gift, he just uses the tweezers to pull the squishy insides out instead of the tongs. 5 stars for the toy itself, minus two stars because it arrived broken.",3.0
"Our daughter really wanted this for Christmas and we were very excited about it as a puzzle, an anatomy lesson and informative toy.  However, while the concept is great the execution is dreadful.  First, it arrived with two right shoulder blade bones which affects the way in which the entire puzzle fits together.  Second, the small plastic ""pins"" that allow parts of the anatomy to fit together do not align in many cases...especially the clear human figure surround.  It absolutely requires a patient adult to work with the child (ours is 7-1/2) due to the fine tuning the ""pins"" require for alignment and snapping together.  The squishy organs are great, but be careful....as with most children's ""squishy toys"" they attract lint and fuzz...so be prepared to rinse them off after playing with the figure on the carpet.  Basically, for $20 this would have been a great purchase if all the proper bones had been included and if the thing fit together easier.....",3.0
"It's a neat learning tool, but it's hard to get it to stay together for display.",3.0
Lots of pieces to keep track of.,3.0
Great learning experience but some of the pieces are hard to fit together. The foot bone did not seem to attach at all.,3.0
"Fun gift, but realistically your child will probably only only play with it a handful of times as it is somewhat frustrating getting all the organs back in",3.0
"Concept is great and my kids would enjoy it but, pieces will not snap together and stay in place.  Sadly we just opened (I ordered during the summer for school year) and my window has passed and I can not return it...",3.0
Not as interactive as I thought it would be.,3.0
My kids love playing with this little human. But we are missing it's liver now... sad day lol. Once you loose a part it doesn't stay together any more. But it is a good toy.,3.0
"It didn't hold the interest of my 7-yr-old. Once you take it apart and put it back together, that's it. You've already learned everything it has to teach.",3.0
"My 7 year old grandson is interested in the human body so I thought this would be fun and interesting for him. However, it's cheaply made and difficult to use which makes it more frustrating than enjoyable. It's okay for the first 5 minutes but disappointing after that.",3.0
Good learning toy . Purchased for a 5th grader who enjoys science.  Was not too challenging to build.  Maybe add more interactive activities with the toy.,3.0
This is really neat but very hard to put back together. It is very interesting and educational but it seems like this will be put back on a shelf and forgotten about.,3.0
"My 3 yr old is very interested on what is going on inside, and this toy tells a great story. The written accompaniments are nice. But it is extremely difficult to snap the plastic pieces to the body form. We can never get it to go together properly. So while he still enjoys taking it apart and putting it back together, it never can be fully assembled and snapped together. The connector pieces are too small, flimsy and don't line up properly.",3.0
Parts don't all snap/stay together. Gave my 5 y.o. grandson a good idea of his own body parts. He liked the project.,3.0
Really easy and fun to put together but the parts hang out a little after you put it together. My son really liked it.,3.0
I am a physician assistant and I think this is the best thing ever.  My eight-year old grandson thinks it is gross.  He gently and graciously advised me that he wants the Battle Ship game instead.  Guess he's not destined for a future in medicine.,3.0
I gave this only 3 stars because I'm giving it as a gift to my nephews for Christmas. So I really don't know how good the quality is. But know my nephews are very smart and have a sister they would like to gross out with body parts.,3.0
"It was a little difficult to assemble.  The pieces on the right leg did not and still do not line up to lock in place.  I'm keeping it as it will be used in a classroom to show body systems.  If kids were going to play and use this product, it would not withstand constant use.  Someone would be bound to break it trying to get the leg pieces to lock together.",3.0
"I like the idea of being able to pull apart the human body and explore organs and body parts this way.  However, we had not opened the box more than 10 minutes when my daughter (who was examining the intestines in a gentle way) found that a piece had broken off in her fingers.  The squishy parts are not able to be superglued back together.  For the money, I would have expected the pieces to at least hold up for one session of taking apart and putting back together.  I will not be recommending this to any of our homeschooling friends.",3.0
This is an interesting and educational toy. My only complaint is the top and bottom halves of the body don't stay together very well & are constantly coming apart. Had to keep them together w/rubber bands.,3.0
"When I have received this toy, the book was missed. However, Amazon solved the problem. This toy was fun for my 4 years old boy, but I have noticed the quality is quite bad. It is hard to match pins and holes on the skeleton parts. It is also a big challenge to put the organs back as they are supposed to be in a real human body. Overall, there is good idea behind this toy and general impression is not very bad, but the quality is poor.",3.0
"I bought this for one of my sons because he is fascinated by the human body right now. On first glance, this is a very cool product. The book that is included is a fun, nicely illustrated introduction to the various parts and systems of the body.

My kids LOVE the squish factor of all the little organs. That is fun. However, they aren't very practical. They are really difficult to get squished back into the guy once you're done. I am not letting them play with it on their own because we are using it as a resource for our science lessons in our homeschool. I think if I let them have free reign over this, it would not last very long. I also wish it had a better way of storing it, because the gummy organs are going to get dusty quickly now that we've opened it up. I will probably end up getting a shoebox-sized plastic tub to keep it in, as the box it comes in isn't going to cut it.",3.0
"Toy did not hold interest of a ten year old boy.  ""Squishy"" parts did not go together easily once removed.  Would not recommend.",3.0
the squishy body parts were not easy to reassemble. I think the parts should be more solid and fit together it a clearer manner.,3.0
"The squishy parts are what attracted the birthday boy to this toy. He has many human body books and enjoys them very much. One of the clear plastic  arms broke within the first half hour of exploration. He still enjoys it, but I was disappointed.",3.0
"I wanted to love this, but I just couldn't because of the poor construction. The book is a great tool for introducing kids to the human body and it does so in a fun and conversational tone. The diagram of the organs was a big hit with my kids and they spent quite a bit of time matching them up to the poster. The organs themselves fascinate the kids with the squishy, not quite slimy feel. My biggest complaint is with the skull and clear plastic exterior. The skull on our body never clicked when closed, so it would constantly fall off after we attached the exterior pieces. And don't even get me started on trying to close the case around the body. Ours just never seemed to line up right. All of the bones, muscles, and hard plastic pieces are attached with these little (very bendable and breakable) plastic knobs that fit into holes. The bones and muscles don't always fit right and we have a hard time manuvering them. If we move them around too much all of the other various pieces start falling off. I know that you are supposed to ""operate"" on the body with it laying down, but as soon as we stand the body up the intestines start falling out. I'm careful about not bringing the toy down until I can supervise, but I'm constantly finding organs all over the place, as they easily fall out when it's standing or when we are carrying it. It's such a great idea and a fantastic resource for studying the human body, I just wish the company had spent a little more time and money making the toy durable.",3.0
We played with the game once. While i was taking out of the box I picked up the skeleton and one of the hips broke. I'm kind of dissapointed.,3.0
"I purchased these for my preschool class because I had a student who was having difficulty learning his letters. Tracing a letter as you say its name and sound is an AWESOME learning tool. I was excited to see a product that would help me do this. However, the letters are raised on the paper and the only texture difference is instead of a glossy feel, it feels like your running your finger over construction paper. I was expected more of a contrast like fine-grained sand. Its not that great.",3.0
"Not enough on each page. Too easy to be called ""advanced."" I do like some of the interestng vocabulary. Those are challenging, but the analagy relationships are too sobvious and simple.",3.0
"My kids enjoyed these cards for learning letter recognition. The texture is minimal and in my opinion doesn't contribute much to the overall quality of the product. The thing is, it doesn't take long before they have learned their letters and sounds and want to start using these card to spell things out. That worked OK for my son Ben but my daughter Alli was frustrated that there is only one of each letter. She couldn't spell her name, as well as a host of other things. I'd say the cards were useful for about four to six months per kid.",3.0
"My 4-year-old daughter and I have enjoyed using these.  The box and the cards are durable, and the color-coding and arrows are clear enough for my daughter to follow without my prompting.

I'm a bit disappointed in the texture, though.  Other ""sandpaper"" letters I've felt had a strong texture that made you want to drag your finger over them repeatedly.  These letters are not nearly as textured as sandpaper.  They have a subtle grain to them -- and therefore provide less tactile stimulation than I expected.",3.0
"I got this for my 6-year old grandson, but it seems to be a little more advanced than I thought.",3.0
For an adult this would be ok but a little hard for the age listed,3.0
"My nephew was not sure what to do with it. Once shown , he love it.",3.0
THIS WILL OCCUPLY CHILDREN FOR A WHILE.  THEY HAVE FUN WITH DOT TO DOT AND TRY TO FINISH THIS BOOK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.,3.0
"When they say extreme its really extreme. Kids and adults may go crazy trying to do this one so just be aware.

Got this as a gift for a 4 year old which she won't even touch",3.0
"This is an intense dot to dot.  We bought it for our 6 year old for Christmas but when we saw it we knew it was out of his league. We will probably give it to our 11 year nephew for his birthday as a side present, but he might be too old for a dot to dot book.",3.0
Given as a gift. Ok comments received.,3.0
"nice product if you have LOTS of time to look for the numbers. if you order, i hope that your eyes are super excellent as the numbers are quite small and there is a lot of hunting to be done. the reviews of this being supremely excellent are exaggerated. it is just nice.",3.0
"When I opened the box, I saw that this book was all smashed and bent. It is also very thin and cheaply made. I feel like I paid way too much for it.",3.0
"We love this game. I do have to say, you pay a lot for a lot of cardboard with this game. If I had it to do over again, I would buy the one with just he bag, not the box. Theyre hard to keep in the expensive box and you end up keeping them in the bag anyway. Also, some of the shapes aren't printed square on the tiles. Not a big deal, but again for the price, I want them square.",3.0
"I don't own the game but have played it. The game itself is very interesting, but the use of a black background for the tiles makes it hard to see the symbols in darker colors such as blue and purple when playing at night. The tiles should use a light or neutral background color like most dominoes games. The tile material feels a but shoddy, too. Again, I would recommend they use a hard material like dominoes.",3.0
"We absolutely *love* the game, which we had played at a friend's house before purchasing our own. The game itself get 5+ stars. The quality of this particular product, though, is not as good as our friend's version. The wood is rougher. The pieces are not as uniformly cut. The black paint is coming off from the edges. (For this last problem, we've coated the worst pieces with black nail polish.)",3.0
My kids and I get bored with it after one play.,3.0
"This game is suppose to be good for people with dementia.  Unfortunately, with vision concerns, too, the game is not easy to play.",3.0
ok - as expected  good service,3.0

Outgas is VERY strong. Have not been able to bring into house.,3.0
kind of hard when they are in mid to advanced stages of dementia.  At least for my mom as she had little to no interest :-(,3.0
"I love the game but the quality is not good. Within 2 months the colors on the tiles started scratching off. They don't seem to have a protective finish over the colors, which over time makes it hard to tell red from orange and blue from green. Now 2 years later I have bought another set but will not play with it until I put several coats of clear coat on them. Too bad I have to protect the finish when the company should be doing that.",3.0
Following instructions on scoring were difficult,3.0
"I love playing this game, but it works SO much better when the bag is included! No bag in mine!",3.0
Not what I expected.,3.0
"Simple kid's games. Good way to introduce young ""board gamers"" into the more advanced board games. Has good replay potential.",3.0
"no body in my family liked this game. but the quality is really good, if you are a fan go ahead.",3.0
"Great to teach kids many different things. It is a fun, very light game. Can't get my group to like it as much as our other games",3.0
Easy game. Just gets old fast,3.0
I am not wild about the game.,3.0
Love this game but it's impossible for my red/green color blind husband to play. We need to mark the tiles with letters so he can discern the colors.,3.0
"It's an ok game.  Easy to play, but not as much strategy as I expected.  Kids love it.  Pricy in my opinion for what you get.",3.0
THE GAME IS NICE BUT THE BOX WAS NOT VERY NEW LOOKING,3.0
"Love the game, but it didn't' even come in a box that we could reuse. The blocks were fit so tightly in the box that we just had to make a bag for them and throw away the box. Other Quirkle boxes I've seen are way bigger.",3.0
Though this was the original made of wood. This was a cheap plastic copy. still fun though.,3.0
This game can be a very exciting game once you understand all the rules. This is not a game that you can explain easily to a child or a teenager with a short attention span. Once the rules are understood this game becomes quiet fun. This strategic game is an excellent addition to any gamers collection.,3.0
"Disappointed and sending it back.  It was missing one of the tiles, a green square.  My child likes the game but no good paying full price if a piece is missing, didn't expect a yard sale deal.",3.0
"I would recommend this game for a big family, with our small family it's just not fun.",3.0
"Probably a super fun game. Instructions were less than helpful, and attention spans would not allow for figuring it out. Need to spend more time trying to understand the correct way to play. After that one experience my kids have not asked to play again.",3.0
Am waiting for address to return shoes for larger size.,3.0
Too intricate for the people I bought it for.,3.0

I was hoping Qwirkle game would come with instructions.  Game pieces arrived in good shape.,3.0

I had super high hopes for this game after reading all the reviews.  For some reason our family just cant get into it...,3.0
"OK, but a little boring for almost any age.",3.0
Gets old fast.,3.0
A bit too easy to play. I expected the game to be more challenging than it is. A decent game too play to allow conversation as well.,3.0
"This game was very ""Meh"" for me.  We hardly ever play it. Fun idea I suppose, but for whatever reason it just doesn't stay interesting for too long.",3.0
"I figured it would be a combination of dominoes and UNO.  Bought it for my 6 year old grand daughter.  Rules were more complex than we wanted to deal with so we made up our own.  It isn't chess or anything, just wanted something to keep a 6 year old entertained for a bit.  It came close, but missed the mark somehow.",3.0
"This game is an awesome thinking game for younger children who are not quite ready to play scrabble.

The game should have 3 of each shape and color tile, however, there was an error, and ours had 4 of one, and 2 of another. It was an error, and sometimes these things happen.

Because my son is only 7, it doesn't really affect the game, but if you are trying to play strategically against another adult, it could pose a problem. It's like playing with a deck of cards that has only 51 cards.

The problem is, because I purchased it near the end of October and didn't open it to play with until after Christmas, as it was a present for one of my children, I don't have the option to return or exchange it because I've passed the deadline for returns. That option button is gone! Literally!

I have been searching for a way to contact customer service at Amazon, and although I am pretty computer illiterate, I have never had a problem finding an 800 contact number, until now.

I understand the need to put a time limit on returns and exchanges, but it's a bummer when all I was trying to do was get a head start on my Christmas shopping.",3.0
It was a little to challenging for our 7 year old boy. He liked Hedbanz better. The adults all liked it although the first go around we didn't follow the rules which made the game easier for him. When we followed the rules the game was a little slower and he wanted to quit.,3.0
"The reason I'm giving the game only three stars is because I bought it for my seven year old grandson, since it said on the box
""six and up"" .  This game is much too complicated for a child that young.  The box said it was ""Mensa approved"" - and if a six year old could play this game, he should be a member of Mensa!  BUT, that being said, it's a great game for adults!  My adult daughter and I have played it quite a few times, and enjoy it a lot.",3.0
"Box said game includes tiles, instruction booklet and bag to store game in.  Both the bag and instructions are missing.",3.0
"Confusing for me.  Will give it another try later.  Hope the children will be able to play it!  Thanks, Martha",3.0
The only negative thing I have to say about this game is I don't win enough. I honestly don't like playing it with my wife and kids cause they are better then me.,3.0
"The box is smaller than what I see in the stores.  The shipping and order fulfillment took longer than expected. There were no instructions for the game in the box.

The pieces are solid wood construction so they'll probably last forever but this makes the game substantially heavier than it needs to be.  The manufacturer could make this more desirable by making a bag to put the pieces in.

Maybe my mind will change on some of this after I've played the game.  But I have to go look up instructions first.....",3.0
"A version of dominoes for kids, but a little boring from the kids point of view.  It is better for just practicing colors and shapes.",3.0
"My family enjoys playing games together. We have been adding new titles to our collection lately and Qwirkle was one of them. We sat down to play (my wife and I along with my 10 year old son and 8 year old daughter) and played a walk-through game to familiarize ourselves with the rules. I can tell that on repeated plays of the game that players would gradually become more proficient at increasing their score. I guess my issue with the game is that now having played it I just wasn't compelled to want to play it again. I am sure we will give it another try at some point but there are so many enjoyable games out there that I would prefer to play instead I don't really see us pulling this one out very often.

Normally I love this kind of game. I like strategy games like chess. I like competitive games like Uno. I like games like scrabble as well (which this game has a passing similarity to). I just didn't get a huge thrill with this one.",3.0
"The kids played with this a few times, but they got bored quickly.  Not a great hit.  Medium, but a nice game.",3.0
"Purchased this game for my grand daughter, was hoping I would see her use it or ask us to play...sorry, but we are unable to rate it fully, fast service at a good price",3.0
"The game is similar to other like this
Very simple you can play in 2 minute you learn the rules. Excellent for young  children
Children as small as 4 can play and learn you need an adult , but will be a perfect teaching time",3.0
"Bought for a Christmas gift to 7 and 9 year old girls.  They were not impressed with the gift.  Like other things better.  Maybe, when their Mom sits down with them they will get excited about the game.",3.0
Hard to find a game that hasn't already been done. This one was fun to play. The only drawback is that no more than 4 people can play at once.,3.0
I hoped that my children would really enjoy this as it had good reviews. My four children ages 11-21 played the game and were somewhat lukewarm about it. The tiles were smaller than I thought they would be. Only the 11 year old has expressed interest in playing it again.,3.0
"This game is for my granddaughter, who likes to play games with her family.  She's almost 8 years old and since it's a Christmas present, I do not know yet whether she will like it or not but it got good reviews.",3.0
This is a good game for ones who are not color blind the colors are not vivid enough to tell the difference other  than that everyone seems to enjoy it maybe one of those should have written the review,3.0
"Family fun game, but maybe more fun for kids not for adults only. I'm sure kids would love this game.",3.0
"The box comes with TILES, BAG & DIRECTIONS - That's it!!
We got this as a gift, but I wouldn't have paid more than $10-15 for this. I understand we all have been cutting back over the last several years, but REALLY? MSRP is $35? This game at the VERY least NEEDS TILE HOLDERS (think 'Scrabble')! Wherever you're playing (floor, table, etc.) you'll need tile holders to keep your pieces. Otherwise, you'll be standing them up like Dominos (and we all know how many times THOSE fall) as you need to keep them hidden from your opponent. For the retail price, this needs to have a Game Board. And really, for ANY price they're asking, how hard would it have been to include a note pad for keeping score? So, get the game (it's fun) but don't pay too much, and expect to grab a pencil and paper & your old scrabble tile holders. Unfortunately, the tiles are too big for your old scrabble board.",3.0
Got this for a family Christmas present.  Friends of ours with similar age children (8 and 11) had recommended it and the premise seemed good.  We play it sometimes but it just doesn't grab us like other games have.  We can't quite work out why but we just don't find it very exciting and challenging.,3.0
"Found this game to be a challenge over and over, not the oh ya I played this before...
I was shocked at nthe game I received, plastic... other locations had wood pieces that were easier to move around the board, seemed more solid... over all this is a great game...",3.0
"Everyone in my family had the same initial reaction, ""Looks lame.""  After all, it's just making rows of shapes or colors.  After the first game we all figured out there's more to it. As my daughter said, ""Well, checkers looks easy too; it's just moving pieces diagonally to the other side of the board.""

On the downside, as another review mentioned, the pieces are cheaply made- low quality wood and paint, non-uniform size. But the most egregious design flaw is the selection of colors.  For me, the red and orange are so close that even in good light I find myself holding them up at different angles just to make sure I don't confuse them.

I must compliment the author of the instructions. As you would expect on a game that appears simple on the surface but ultimately has many nuances, communicating those to the game player is essential.  The directions walk through a hypothetical series of moves that pretty much cover any scoring or strategy intricacy that you might run into.

Bottom line: As long as you have decent color vision and are not a stickler for perfection in construction then put this game in your cart and check out right now.  Your family will thank you.",3.0
"I have had a lot of fun playing this with my nice and nephew.  It is great fun! This game was is a hit with the little ones and the grownups! There's lots of strategy to be used, but the youngest kids can even play without that! If you make a set of six by color and shape you get six bonus points, and you can set up your future plays with a bit of planning.",3.0
"We purchased this game to play with our 2 boys, ages 13 and 11.  The game is okay, the 13 yr old enjoyed it more than the 11.  It does help develop problem solving skills.",3.0
"My family has been playing the Scene It? games for quite a while now.  We own the standard game, as well as several of the specialty versions such as Star Trek, Lord of the Rings and Disney.

I have to say, that after I gathered the family together to play this latest version, either I am getting old and impatient, or this version was not put together very well.

The scene and game-mode changes take forever to boot up and change over.  There is just general lag with the DVD whenever you ask it to do anything.  Additionally, the desert backdrop is bland and boring to look at, and they added light bloom to it for some unfathomable reason.  And the chattering ""comedy teeth"" get old really fast as the spokes-model for this version of the game.

The questions range from ridiculously obvious (asking for the titles of well known comedy movies after seeing a clip), to mind-blowingly difficult (the names of obscure actors in obscure films none of us had ever heard of).

Overall, we had fun with it, but I think we had fun more in spite of the game, than because of it.  Overall, I think the presentation of the game was rather bland, the DVD was slow and laggy, and the questions were all over the place.  It would be nice if they could classify the questions as either: easy or hard, so that we could skip the obscenely obvious ones.

Not a terrible way to spend an hour or so with the family, but not a great way either.  3 stars.",3.0
"This is the first standalone Scene It game I've played, but I've really enjoyed breaking out the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xbox-360-version/dp/B000W6TFRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xbox 360 version</a>&nbsp;when friends come over and we have some downtime.

As with the console version, the Comedy Movies board game draws from a broad range of movies -- from the '60's to the late 2000's in the games I played, so all players have a reasonably fair shot at answering questions. That being said though, the questions seem geared for the 28 - 38 crowd -- exceptions, of course, for tweens who adore Dr. Strangelove, and Grandmas who think Judd Apatow movies are hilarious.

Gameplay is pretty straightforward. Thankfully, the DVD has a chapter for gameplay and objective, so everyone can watch at once. Unfortunately though, once you get past that, the pacing is awkward. If you're not comfortable with navigating DVD elements beyond ""Play Movie"", Scene It is going to infuriate you (or players who you pass the remote to).

Another downside is the ""play until you get it wrong"" gameplay. Because the questions are more broad than deep, it is entirely possible -- in fact, plausible -- that a single person can dominate the game before others even get a chance to roll. Playing the short version of the game, it's possible for the first player to complete the game in three turns.

Ultimately, Scene It needs a fair amount of effort to play, and not in the sense that it makes the game challenging or fun. Setting everything up and dealing with the pace of the game just doesn't seem to pay off for the effort you put in to it.

If you happen to have an Xbox 360, you're way, WAY better off getting that version of Scene It and sacrificing the comedy-only aspect of this game.",3.0
"This game is not one of those games that are self-explanatory. You really have to read the instruction very carefully and even then it was confusing. I also didn't like the colors, esp. the red and orange. You can tell them apart but not very easily. And since color is a big component of this game, that little confusion comes up often. Anyway, I was not too impressed.",3.0
"I LOVE the Scene It games because I love watching movies. Getting together with a group is even better to play this sort of game-and the bigger the group, the more fun it is. I've played the original, Disney Scene It, Harry Potter Scene it, and there may have been one more. I was glad to try the Comedy one even though I am not a fan of comedic films. I still figured I would enjoy it. Well, game-play is pretty much the same as the other Scene Its so I won't go into that. What I will say is this isn't nearly as fun as the other games I played. It's actually sort of hard. I may not be a big comedy lover but people in my group were and even they were stumped half the time. Some of the puzzles were hard and the trivia-even harder. But if you are a fan of interactive games, and movies, then I would recommend it. Plus the price is great compared to some of the other Scene It games.",3.0
"I am not a big ""game"" person, but we got this for my brother and his wife as a gift. Of course, we had to play it, and I must say, it was a pretty good time. I enjoy funny movies and this game really gave me a run for my money. While not totally obscure, some of the answers movies referenced where on the fringe. Overall a fun game, but be sure to set aside some time to play, as it does take a while, especially with more than two teams.",3.0
"This game is well-designed, but there are some issues.  Although the game is for 13 years and up, a lot of the movies highlighted are R-rated movies from various years.  The film clips were appropriate for the age level, but a fair amount of questions were from R-rated movies.

 Although my family hasn't seen a lot of recent movies, we still enjoyed the game, even though we couldn't answer any of the trivia questions; they were too obscure; even for movies we were familiar with.",3.0
"I played Scene It? Comedy Movies Deluxe with my spouse. Neither of us had played a Scene It? game before.  The instructions are easy to understand and all of the components seem well made.  We found it mildly entertaining.  Some questions require no skill, just luck. I don't think this is a game that we will want to play again unless we have a bigger group. I do think it would be more fun then.",3.0
"Scene It Comedy Movies Deluxe is a pretty amusing game to play with one other person or a group of people. The objective is to answer questions about comedy movies correct so you get to the winner's circle. There are also multiple ways to answer questions. Either with the DVD or with the trivia cards. This was my first Scene It game and it was pretty interesting. The setup was simple and the game pieces were hilarious (banana peel, whoopee cushion, rubber duck, etc.).

Do expect this game to keep you entertained and be sure to use the extended game board as we found that the game is too short when playing with the smaller version of the game board. There were quite a few questions that had both of us stumped. I noticed that with the My Play section on the DVD, the questions asked are inconsistent when it comes to difficulty level. There would be a question about the director of a movie and that's not something many people would pick up. Then there would be a question about the movie that was answered for you right in the movie clip. Or in the My Play, you would receive a very difficult question about the movie and then when everyone answers the question after you answered it, it would be a very simple question that lets your opponent take the lead.

The buzz cards were all about the same. All three that I grabbed would be something about ""This is your turn."" And then the next person is skipped.

Also the cover of the game is a bit misleading. Looking at it with the actors featured on the box, we thought it would be all current comedies that are slapstick funny. But it turns out that there were a lot of old comedies. Majority of them were ones from the '80s or '70s. There were a lot of Meryl Streep movies also featured. There are also romantic comedies and even a kid's movie featured in the game. So be aware that this is really more of an all encompassing movie game.

The game kept us entertained but it is not on our first choice of game to play. It is something that'd be great fun with a very large group of people but with just two people it's just OK. So if you need fun with a group of people, be sure to try it out.",3.0
"I had received one other ""Scene it?"" game in the past, and just as with this one, I enjoyed it a lot more when we dispensed with the ""game"" board and pieces, and just focused on the party mode.  When you do it this way, you don't use the materials at all -you only use the DVD and everyone plays together, completing mini games over and over, with little down time between them.  In my opinion, this moves much more quickly, and enjoyably, than using the game board.

With this comedy version, I found it to be even better than the regular ""Scene it?"" game -with one exception.  It was really annoying that a good percentage (30%?) of the movies that were shown were forgetable movies that appeared only in the last year, and were nowhere near classic status movies.  Yes, I get that you need children's movies to round things out, but I can't imagine children really enjoying this, as too many references are for those who are middle aged or at least in their twenties.  I mean, do we really need to showcase movies like the Garfield and Chipmunks movies for this game, over more classic movies like Animal House or Airplane?

That said, there were a couple more categories that were added to this game that we really enjoyed.  My favorite one was the animated game which was a real hoot.  It digitized certain sections of the movies and you basically watched a cartoon version of certain scenes from various movies, and THAT was really creative and fun.

Overall I would say that if you really like ""Scene it?"", then this is four stars.  But, if you think it really only is fun to play at a party -especially when people can come and go, and you don't have to play every round- then I would only give it three stars.

Recommended for fans of the series.",3.0
"I really thought this game would be more fun, or even more funny, than it is.  I have played other Scene It? games, so I knew what to expect with the gameboard set up, rules, categories, and so on.  I think this game works best when it caters to a more specific movie interest, like Harry Potter, Star Trek, Twilight, etc.  ""Comedy Movies"" just seems too generic. If you were to create a game around this, it might have been better to sample some older classics like Some Like It Hot or the Marx Brothers films, and mix them in with more modern classics like Tootsie or Groundhog Day, rather than relying exclusively on more recent films, some of which were not so great.  And couldn't they find funnier clips?  As for the ""bonus games"", they're nothing special, just some on-screen prompts to play versions of games like Charades and Pictionary. I'm sure some players will find this fun, and if it were the first Scene It? game I ever played, I might find it more fun too.  It's just that there are so many better versions out there.",3.0

"Those of you who who know me on here know I am not a big fan of these teeny bopper films, but I do like the Scene It? game. This edition covers all three films and will surely be a big hit for fans of the series.

"If you have played other Scene It? games and had fun with them, then this delivers the same quality of fun as you would expect here with the Twilight themed version. While probably teenage girls would have more fun seeing pictures of all their favorite actors and testing their knowledge of everything int he films and books, its a limited scope and so not really for everyone (regardless of how popular Twilight is). This game is always more fun with more people involved as its designed to be either a family game or party style game. So getting enough people who know all about Twilight would make or break the fun factor in this game.",3.0
"The Twilight saga ""Scene It?"" is a fun game for the whole family. It features a cornucopia of clips, trivia questions, and on-screen puzzles from all three Twilight films, as well as mini games, and bonus activities. If you're a Twilight fan, this is the game for you",3.0

"We were really suprised by the poor quality of this game, particularly given the previous high reviews.  We have the other Disney SceneIt game and the quality of the board and pieces were far superior.  This board was flimsy and the playing pieces cheap.  But more annoying than that, the All Plays and My Plays seem to play in the same order every time.  Really expected more from this.  Only reason I gave it a 3 star was that the questions were easy enough for my 3 year-old to play with us and I got this on a previous deal for only $11.58.",3.0
"This game operates a lot like the old game Trivial Pursuit.  You move your piece around the board and answer questions, trying to be the first to complete a circuit around the game board.  The questions are all Disney-themed, but many of them focus on the tween and pre-tween oriented Disney shows of the past ten or fifteen years or so.  So, unless you're really up on those shows, it's not likely to have much appeal.  This game would probably work best for families with kids under 13 or 14 years old.  I didn't find it very fun.",3.0
Kindof difficult for my younger kids... but they knew most of the questions!,3.0
"I'll be upfront here: I've never played a Scene It game before.  I know the basics of it, however, and my wife and I are avid movie buffs, so the idea of mixing watching movie clips and testing our knowledge sounds like it would be our cup of tea.

That being said, I think this version of Scene It might've been the wrong foray into the genre for us.  We're adults with no children, and while we both love Disney films, we're more accustomed to the older classics, like ""Sleeping Beauty,"" and the newer ones, like ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Sure, we've seen and enjoyed many of the new Pixar films, but the trivia in this game seems to be skewed towards a younger audience, despite the ""ages 6 - adult"" label on the box.  Perhaps they meant adults with children who constantly watch the Disney channel?

As a game, I'd give Scene It four stars.  The gameplay isn't terribly hard to understand, particularly if you've played any amount of board games before, and the content is interesting and family-friendly.  But if you're going to title your game ""Magical Moments,"" I'd like to see it to be more well-rounded in terms of diversity.  Disney has a rich 70-year history of ""magical moments"" and this game is too heavy on the ""magic"" of the last ten years.  For that, I have to deduct a star.

Like I said, if you enjoy movies, the Scene It game franchise is certainly an interesting mix of movies and board games.  I'd recommend this to any family with children ages 5 - 12, as it's a great way to have a family game night.  But if you're looking for a classic Disney experience, as others wrote, you'd perhaps be better served looking for a different version of Scene It.",3.0
"This was the first time we've played a ""Scene It?"" game, so most of my feedback revolves around the format instead of the specific version.  Also, we only played it once, and I have not been able to get my 7-year-old interested in playing it again.

First, after playing this I've realized there's a LOT about Disney movies I have no clue about.  The questions are very challenging.  Fortunately, kids can get the easy kid's questions instead of the grown-up questions.  Second, I was disappointed that in the course of normal game play we only got to play one video.  I thought each question would involve watching a video clip but mostly you use the DVD as a timer, or for some other games.  This is luck of the die, but still, I wasn't thrilled.  Also, there wasn't enough Pixar in this one.  Our kids love Pixar, but don't necessarily know or care for the more obscure Disney films from the 1960's.  Buzz Lightyear trumps ""The Rescuers.""

A great thing about this game is that if you want to make the game shorter, you fold the game board up into a smaller shape.  Very handy, very easy.  The format of the game supports grown-ups play with young children.  Hopefully I'll be able to talk my kid into playing this again soon.",3.0
"This was my family's very first Scene It game, and overall we were not terribly impressed.  We were expecting a simple board game with questions, games, and puzzles coming from the enclosed DVD.  In reality, while the DVD was indeed fun and interactive, the game play was unnecessarily complicated and clunky, forcing us parents to constantly refer to the DVD tutorial or the enclosed instructions.  Even by the end of our first 45-minute game, I was still not convinced that we were following all the directions correctly regarding the trivia card categories, the Buzz cards, the DVD options, the tokens, and rules such as if a player answers another player's question when it's not their turn, they can move two places or take a Buzz card, but if the actual player gets their own question correct, they don't get either of those things, they just get to keep playing.  Or something.  I'm still confused.

What started out as a family game quickly because a mild distraction for the parents only, as my daughter quickly lost interest in 30-second video clips and game play that prompted her frustrated parents to keep checking the rule book.  So, in the end, my wife and I played the game.  The questions were fairly balanced between classic animated Disney and new Disney, though I noticed a bit more Pixar and modern Disney (High School Musical, Narnia) in the mix.  Despite Mickey and Pluto prominently appearing on the box, we never encountered a single question that related to any short subjects.  This was all movie trivia, about 70% from 1995-2010 films.  I was amused and perplexed by the choice of tokens, reflecting modern Disney most of all.  Buzz and Wall-E were the Pixar selections, and for the other two: Tinkerbell and (surprise) Rapunzel, whose film has not yet been released and who never appears anywhere in the game to my knowledge.

Nevertheless, despite the frustrating game play itself, the DVD delivered.  It was indeed fun, and the clips (ranging in our game from Snow White to Monsters, Inc.) were high-quality and forced you to pay attention.  This edition also includes some ""bonus games,"" which are basically excuses to play with the DVD without bothering with the board game.  There's a variation of charades and related fun.

Overall, I doubt we'll be sitting down for a full board game of Scene It very often.  If more than a week goes by, we'll forget the rules and be forced to start the learning process over again.  The DVD, however, might get some use as occasional family fun during dinner.  I give the board game 2 stars, and the DVD content 4 stars.  All together, that equals a 3 for this slightly recommended board game.  I would, however, more highly recommend one of Disney's older CD-ROM trivia games such as ""The D Show.""  It was much more fun, if you can find a system still able to play it.",3.0

this is a really fun game...my husband and i thought we could play it because the box had shows on it that we remember growing up (we were born in late 70's) but most questions were way too hard..this would be a great game for someone in their 40's and up...,3.0
"My Twilight-obsessed teenage daughter and her friends played this game several times.

They enjoyed the trivia questions, but preferred to dispense with the game board. They were more interested in the clips and outdoing each other with their vast Twilight knowledge than the details of the board game itself. They especially enjoyed the fact that all three movies released to date were included in this edition.

That being said, it is a great sleepover game for teenage girls who are in to Twilight (aren't they all)? If you're looking for a great tween gift or planning a party or sleepover, this is a good choice.",3.0
"This review is based on a product supplied as part of the Amazon Vine program.

I'm going to review this product in two parts: the game mechanics, and the Twilight content.  Just to give you a bit of context, I'm a trivia geek.  I've read all the Twilight books, and seen the movies.  I'm not a fan, but my wife is.

The SceneIt games are good trivia games.  There are a few variations on the rules, which allow you to control the length of the game.  You can either use the long or short version of the board, and you can choose when to apply your moves.  There is a good variety of card based trivia questions, as well as DVD based trivia questions.  The All Play type questions are also good.  You control which type and category of question you get based on your dice roll.  Your movement along the board is also controlled by dice roll.  The mechanics are the same for all Scene It games.  We did have a problem playing a different Scene It game in a battery powered portable DVD player.

The Twilight content is good content.  You can enjoy playing this game just by having seen the movies.  I don't remember any questions which would have required you to read the books, or have extensively studied the movies IMDB pages.

If you're looking for an approachable Twilight trivia game, this one doesn't disappoint.  If you're not a fan of the Twilight franchise, you're going to be supremely bored.",3.0

"The game was fun, but not overwhelming.  We played it at a gathering of friends: 3 teams of couples.  Overall we had a good time, but it was just okay overall.  I think the 'party mode' might be the best feature since you can just leave it running while people are mingling.",3.0
Game is very average and we lost interest within an hour.  Pacing is too slow and board/questions are poorly integrated.,3.0

"Enclosed in this box is not just one game, but three!  Twilight Scene it includes questions based off the first three movies in the Twilight saga-- Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.  The board game folds together to form a quick game or folds out to form a longer game.

As far as game play goes, Twilight Scene It follows suit with the other Scene It games.  There are questions that are playable on your DVD player and questions you read off of cards depending on what dice you roll.  You move a token (of which this game comes with four) around the board until you reach home base and answer the final question of the game.

I found the DVD menu's to be a little slow, but overall, the DVD worked fine in my player.  The questions are all aimed at the movies, so this game is not for fans solely of the book series.

DVD games aren't my favorite genre, but this one wasn't too bad.  The New Moon questions, from what I can tell, are pretty easy, but me and the the other players in my demo game got stumped a few times on the Twilight and Eclipse ones!  This game is perfect for your next 'Twilight' party or even a movie release party!  If you are in love with the Twilight movies, I think you'll be in love with this game set, too!",3.0
"I'll admit, I'm as big a consumer as anyone. I purchase plenty of merchandise I don't really need -- it's the ""American Way,"" I suppose. Nonetheless, I am always loathe to see grotesque exploitation (especially of a title that targets children/young people). While I thought the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scene-It-Twilight-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00263PYE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scene It? Twilight Deluxe Edition</a>&nbsp;was a little premature in its release, now I understand the reasoning. To release yet another Scene It? a mere two films later is simply preposterous. And how long before that ""complete edition"" hits shelves ... and then, the ""ultimate edition"" ... and, then ... well you see the point.

Perhaps of equal concern, while this is the ""deluxe"" product (and priced as such), it is not packaged in a ""keepsake"" tin. (Those with the ""deluxe"" version of Scene It? know what I mean). This is just a regular cardboard box. A pity. At least a metal container would have (almost) justified the price.

If you have read this far and maintained an open-mind (instead of simply clicking ""not helpful""), I can tell you for whom this product is perfect. Buy this edition if your child does not already have the earlier version. Obviously, it is more comprehensive ... and it certainly is more challenging. And, yes, it is tremendous fun. However, do not allow your child to become a victim of the ""Hot Topic"" mentality ... owning the official Twilight Snuggie, toothbrush, all five breath-mint tins, and the fingerless gloves does make a person a ""bigger fan."" It makes that person a cliche (and, more relevant to this review,  a marketer's dream).

If you already have the first version (or both deluxe and regular editions of the first version) pick this up for fifty-cents at a yard-sale three years from now. Or simply wait for the final, final, final, Stephenie Meyer endorsed edition.",3.0
"Based on the old animated television Christmas special ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", this DVD game has four players heading out to rescue the scattered misfit toys before the Abominable Snow Monster.  The object is to be the first player to collect three different colored toys before Bumble the Abominable Snow Monster has collected six toys. When a player lands on a Misfit Toy token the DVD plays a mini puzzle for that token's region (ie; Santa's Castle,Great North Mountains. Reindeer Games Playground, and Elf Toy Shoppe).  Solving the puzzle wins the toy and a missed answer returns to toy back to the Island of Misfit Toys.  This game is way to easy for older children and they will quickly outpace the younger ones.  They only need to have seen the TV show once or twice to solve the mini games and these mini games are way to easy for them.  It becomes more of a race to see who can roll a higher number on the dice.  Little kids 6 and under will enjoy this but I don't think it will become a family favorite. For the price of this, I'd recommend buying the TV shows on DVD.  I think all those old animated shows are out now and available for less than the price of this game.  Buy only if this was your favorite TV special otherwise look for something else more challenging.",3.0
"My four year old nephew and I played this Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer game on a chilly and gloomy Saturday afternoon. In order to win the game, you (as Clarice, Rudolph, Santa, or Hermie) have to rescue the misfit toys before Bumble can get to them. The DVD gives you challenges that you have to win in order to get that misfit toy. The mini-games on the DVD include a memory matching game, finishing a song lyric, and a guessing whose voice it is on a sound clip from the movie, along with some other games.

My nephew liked the game for about 10 minutes but then got bored and started to make the characters talk to each other. Older children might like this game and play it all the way through a bit better. As for me, I kind of liked the DVD mini-games that we play in order to get the misfit toys the best. It's a great idea for those who have grown up watching Rudolph on TV every year. So it isn't the best game out there but I'm sure that kids 5 and older would find great enjoyment from it.",3.0
"This game initially appealed to me as a potential Christmas gift for my grandchildren. I thought that it would be fun to combine with other toys that you play with alone or with just one other child. It is admit-ably cute and the concept of use is clever. You collect toy tokens and avoid the Bumble Monster. It is not however, easy to play. The directions are on the DVD, so you don't get them all before you play. You are continually restocking the toys as you proceed. This start and stop is discomforting.  It takes about 30 - 40 minutes to play and that is just too long for young children. It becomes frustrating for 6 - 8 year olds who are waiting to ""win"" to finally collect enough misfit toys.  The mini-games, interspersed throughout are fun in themselves, but add to the length of play. I played with the children, but felt that a small group- say 4-5 children- led by an older child - of 12 or so - would have been a better fit. Because it was new, it was interesting, but I wonder if it would retain its interest after time. If I could have previewed its play it, I would not have ordered it. I think that there is great potential for boredom and confusion. The idea is fine, but its execution is not up to my standards.",3.0
"I played this DVD game with my kids and it was a little lame.  The whole 'misfit toy' cardboard circles were very lame.  The DVD itself had some fun things in it, like short clips and 'guess who wins the race', but there weren't that many things in there.  All-in-all, we played it for 45 minutes and will probably only play it for 45 minutes every year.",3.0
"My editorial review:
The Rudolf DVD game is geared toward kids, but is a good option for the Rudolf-loving family game night.  If you've played Scene-It, the gameplay and DVD usage is very similar.  Most of the questions and games are pretty easy, and they mirror some of the same types of challenges in Scene-It.  The difficulty is reduced for younger kids.  My 7 and 9 year olds had very few problems playing the game on their own once I had played a couple rounds with them.  Most game-related instructions are both spoken and shown on the screen so that players with limited reading skill can still play.  The time per game is pretty accurate at 30-45 minutes.  It is limited to 4 players, though you could have more than four work as teams to answer the minigame challenges.

The object is to collect and return the toys which have been scattered across the land.  You roll a die to move your character onto a toy-token, then successfully win the on-screen minigame to collect that token.  Collect 3 tokens of different colors to win.  At the same time, the Bumble (which is controlled by the game) is also trying to steal the toys.  If he steals 6 before any player collects 3, the game is over.  Therefore, the gameplay is a mix of board-based movement and on-screen games and instructions.

As an adult, I really appreciate that all the graphics, characters, and scenes are from the original movie.  They did a good job of keeping the look of the game consistent with the original rather than resorting to computer-graphics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-the-Island-of-Misfit-Toys/dp/B00005NB93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer & the Island of Misfit Toys</a>.  The packaging is nice and everything fits well back into the box.  I would have liked a plastic jewel case for the dvd rather than a cardboard sleeve, though.

Overall, the kids like playing it, and it's as enjoyable a flashback for my wife and I to watch and play along or help our kids with some of the answers.  I might not pay the full $20 for it, but at a reasonable discount it would be a good purchase in my mind.

Quick assessment:
Overall, I think the game is worthy of 3 stars - It's ok.  I like it, and it has potential for a better rating, but there's some gameplay issues.

Good points:
-All original graphics and scenes (except for the game narrator).
-Gameplay suitable for kids on their own
-Difficulty applicable to the age range
-No reading required for young players

Areas of improvement:
-Gameplay speed
-Not a lot of strategy or depth
-No freeplay or quickplay mode
-Instructions not entirely clear

Details behind my opinion and rating:

To be 4 stars:
The game mechanics need improved.
The DVD menu layout should match the game board.  I suspect they rearranged it so that you could easily tell whether to press up/down/left/right on the DVD remote.  To make the screen match the board would mean the regions are in the 4 corners of the screen, meaning you'd need to potentially press in two directions to get to the correct region rather than just one click.  Even so, the screen doesn't have the regions in the same order as the board.

The number of toys the Bumble steals should go from 0 at the bottom to 6 at the top.
In the voice instructions, it says ""Move the Bumble's counter up"".  It means ""up by one number"", but on the game board the numbers increase as you move the counter down.  Only slightly confusing, but for kids, everything should be more clear to avoid mistakes.

Add full audio setup instructions with an option to repeat the last message.
When setting up for the first time, neither the DVD nor the instructions have the full setup and gameplay procedure.  It takes a combination of the two to do it right.  Once you've played a couple of times, it's easy to understand, but it's frustrating for the first few rounds.  Additionally, there's no option to repeat the instruction last given, so if you miss it, you're stuck figuring it out on your own.  Once you select an option, there's no ""undo"".  So if you select the wrong region, or accidentally say you've collected 3 toys, the game doesn't give you a chance to correct your mistake.

For 5 stars:
Speed up the gameplay.
The transitions between actions occurring (Bumble moving, Bumble stealing a toy, and Placing/removing tokens) doesn't flow well.  Often the next person is taking their turn either because the pause is long enough you think you're supposed to, or you're just too impatient to wait for the ""Pass the remote to the next player"" message.  Often, you'll get two or three instructions per turn, meaning it really slows down the gameplay.  My kids didn't seem to mind, but I lost interest after about two games because of how slow it was to get from one turn to another.  Even allowing you to fast-forward the individual instructions would help.

Fix gameplay irregularities.
The game seems to try and keep track of how many tokens are on the board and where they are, as well as how many token the Bumble has stolen, but it doesn't always seem to work right.  We've found that it sometimes tells you to put a token on a spot that's already occupied.  The instructions aren't clear if you put a second one down or if you don't.  Once we were told the Bumble stole a toy, but in that region there wasn't one on the board.  These might have been our error as well, but it adds to confusion on occasion.  All of these can be played around, but I didn't get the feeling that the game was truly polished and error-free.  Also, it could do a better job of randomly assigning where to put the tokens.  The Bumble sometimes moves to a region that he's already sitting in.  By telling you to put him where he already is makes it a bit confusing and at the very least adds extra time to the gameplay for no reason.  Lastly, on at least one occasion, if the DVD thinks there's no token in the the region in which you've landed on one, it won't let you select that region's minigame.  Therefore, that player can't play a minigame without potentially messing up the token count of other regions.

Allow a free-play mode.
I'd really like to be able to play the minigames without the board.  If you're a fan of the movie, it's still fun to play the minigames even if they are a bit easy for adults.  It would be nice to have a ""free play"" feature.  This could also let you create a ""quick play"" version that allows 4 people to race to collect all 5 misfit toy tokens of their color by answering questions correctly.

In the grand scheme, I do like the game but feel it could have been polished up a bit and it would be much better.  I like the game, but the poor setup procedure, occasional errors in gameplay, and how slow the game progresses are what keep me from giving it a 4-star rating.

Other observations:
-My contents differ from that in the product description:
The ""4 Collectible Figurines/ Movers"" are really just cardboard cutouts with plastic stands.  They're nice, thick cardboard, better quality than those found in many kids' games, but definitely not collectible figurines.

It mentions 9 Yukon Cornelius tokens and only 11 misfit toy tokens.  I'm not sure what those are.  We had 20 toy tokens, the single Bumble token, and the player markers.  Maybe the description is referring to a different game or an earlier version.  All the pieces are included to play the game, they are just different than what the product description calls out.  Amazon's review is functionally the same as what I received, though slightly different than what the pictures",3.0
"This game works for us sometimes.......and sometimes not.

The premise for the game is cute.  We love this movie and watch it several times each Christmas, so when I was offered to try out this game, I jumped at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the game didn't always quite work out the way I was hoping it would. The questions were appropriate for my 5 year old and she always gets excited when she answers one correctly.....but she is an extremely sensitive child.  The way this game works, Bumble has an opportunity to steal presents and once he successfully steals 6 presents, *HE* wins the game. This REALLY upsets my daughter. She doesn't mind losing a game to her mommy or her daddy.....or one of her stuffed animals, as they often play with us.....but she has a serious problem losing to a ""bad guy"" like Bumble.

Overall, this game is kind of cute, but we don't get all that excited about it. It's one of those take-it-or-leave-it kind of games, i.e. if the weather is bad and there is absolutely nothing else to do, we'll drag this game out. But we usually pick just about any other activity (over this game) if given the choice.",3.0
"I think I am close to the perfect target audience for this game.  I have young children, we like to play games together, and we also enjoy watching our Christmas Classics DVD with the highlight being Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  Sure, they are a tad young to be able to play (that why I say close) but they usually just play on my or my wife's team.  So when we received this game, we were excited to share another fun family experience.

Unfortunately that not how it turned out.  The game is an odd mix of neat nostalgia, bad design choices, and bland gameplay.  Here are the pros and cons as I see them.

Pros:
* Nostalgia factor.  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is about as good as it gets in terms of Christmas nostalgia and tradition for many.
* Simple gameplay.  the game isn't really that complicated so almost anyone can pick up and play it.
* Sturdy packaging.  The box should be able to withstand some ""cabinet crush"", that is what happens when you stack all those board games on top of each other.

Cons:
* Weird mix of over-communication and under-communication.  Many times when playing the game, we were left wondering what to do and yet the game is constantly telling you what to do.  Stuff like, is it my turn, when do I roll the dice, etc, and yet after every turn the game say to pass the remote, do this and do that over and over.
* Cheap feeling.  I understand using card board for the misfit toys but not using platic or die cast piece for the player tokens, bumble and bumble counter smacks of cost costing.
* Confusing board.  Is the north pole one giant x shaped space or four individual spaces?  Where are the demarcation points for each zone?  Things like this take away from the simple gameplay.

Debatable:
* Like my experience with Disney Scene-it (which is much more fun by the way), games are generally very short with a round lasting around 15 minutes.
* Mini-games, which need to be won to earn a misfit toy, lean to the easy side with at least one based on sheer luck.

In the end, a game is supopsed to be fun and in this case I am sad to report that my family just didn't have that much of it with this one.  Not a terrible package, but with a few deisgn tweaks it could have been competent.  In my opinion this game would only rate a two but with the benefit of such a great license it earns another star.",3.0
"Without repeating what has already been said in other reviews, I simply want to add to the advice that this game is for hardcore Simpsons fans.  I thought I was one...until I played this game.  I have watched the Simpsons since the early 90's and have seen most episodes at least 4-5 times.  This game was still very difficult for me. I thought that I would be able to play it with my kids (10 and 5) who watch the Simpsons with me, but it was really to difficult for them. However, I enjoyed watching the clips and it's a great collectible for serious fans.  I also got it for a fantastic price on Amazon, so no regrets!",3.0
love the show. game is ok,3.0
"Got this for Christmas. When we played it, it was not much fun. It takes forever for scenes to load up and some questions are just impossible. My hubby and I have been watching the Simpsons since the beginning and struggled with a lot of these questions. A regular trivia game with cards would have been more fun.",3.0
"Bought this game from Amazon at a really low price.  Played it with my niece, nephew, and daughter, and unfortunately it wasn't very fun.  The questions were pretty hard and I think only real die-hard Simpsons fanatics would know the answers to most of the questions.  Too difficult for the casual watcher.",3.0
"I got this as a Christmas present for my husband. We own most of the Simpson seasons on DVD and the questions can still be extremely challenging even for him. We plan on bringing this out when there are other hardcore simpson fans so it'll be more fun than just playing with me ( the wife, who is not so knowledgable).",3.0
"I bought this item since all of my friends watched The Simpsons a lot.  We thought that it would be a nice and easy game to play and compete with each other on, but it is hard as hell.  There are a lot of questions that we nothing about and the game rules doesn't make sense.  You get to move ahead regardless of whether you answer correctly or not so every can catch up to the leader, who may be one question away from winning.",3.0
"For Simpsons fanatics like my husband and I, this game was fun, at times challenging, and motivating for a few rounds.  The only problem is with the actual ""scene it"" part of the game.  Once you've played, maybe, 3 times, the questions start to repeat and repeat frequently.",3.0
"I got this hoping for more Next Generation questions, since I grew-up watching mostly this series, and it's by far the most hilarious.  Original series and Voyager come a close second.",3.0
"The game was better than I thought it would be, but it could be SOOOOO much better. At least with the other scene-it games there is a mixture of on-screen stuff and board game stuff. With the Ice Age game is 100% on-screen stuff, and it can take forever to play the game because you are waiting for your DVD player to catch up. The use of Rudy is fun. The first time we played, Rudy was never put into action and the game wasn't as fun, but on our second game we found Rudy in the beginning and it added more fun and strategy to the game. (As strategic as kids under the age of 8 get anyways.)

The only thing you do in this game is play mini games on the DVD, watch a few clips just for fun, and move your pieces on the board. If they had added in clips of the movie WITH questions, or had cards to turn over with questions it would be better. However, as it is, the kids can play by themselves at any age as long as at least one kid can use the DVD remote. We did have a problem with some of the games skipping, even on our 1st time playing it...with no scratches on the DVD. For example, on the musical game, kind of similar to old SIMON Says game, it skipped the part you were suppose to mimic and skipped right to the answer. I had to guess twice and luckily for me there are only 3 choices. Then on the acorns under the shell game, it skipped over the mixing of the shells so you had to guess blindly...actually that made it a little more challenging, since the kids almost always knew where the 3 acorns were, but it was still a little annoying. I only paid $10 for it, and wish I had only paid $5 at most, but oh well.",3.0
"We actually did not know what to expect when we purchased this game as a Christmas gift for our daughter. Overall, it isn't bad. There is educational value with counting and color recognition. My only wish would be for more variety in the mini-games that you play on the DVD player. There are some scenes from all of the movies, which is nice. Although Scrat is not one of the game characters, the clips are mostly of his antics. The use of Rudy the dinosaur as the game's villain is a little complicated the first time you play the game. I am sure we will enjoy it more when we have a chance to play it again. I would recommend this game to Ice Age fans.",3.0
"Wonderful setting, clunky rules that were re-utilized from the miniatures game, looking very simplistic in some fields, like unified damage dice, while having many different abilities that feel almost like D&D 4e powers. I was caught by the setting since the d20 edition, and was looking forward for the appropriate rules, but I'm disappointed with the result. I gave three stars only for the setting and beautiful interior and exterior art, the rules have that hard to swallow ""game-istic"" and ""videogame-istic"" feel that ruins immersion and makes the actual play looks like a miniature game, and not a RPG; my group had a hard time incorporating the characters, it all felt too artificial.",3.0
"After years of waiting for this to come out, owning the originals and even trying their Warmachine miniature game...I have to say this was a disappointment. This game is more or less another grab at trying to get you to buy their Warmachine miniatures. They hack up all of the original fluff content for future releases and give you a totally uninspired RPG system. The game has no feeling other than ""roll dice, kill stuff."" The generous fluff and breath of life in the world is missing from this book at every page. From their bland magic system, to their six monsters in the book it is a complete and utter let down. It's hard to believe that the same people who wrote such gold as the Monsternomicon, World guide and the like can come back and deliver such trash.

If you're looking for an RPG to immerse yourself in, do yourself a favor and pick up the old World Guide. If you must buy this, pick up the World Guide and the other product line to help flesh the world out. If I have to say anything good about it, the combat system works I guess?",3.0
"Ran a game with it. Pretty decent. This book has HILARIOUSLY good production values - loads of full-color art, lots of awesome illustrations, and lots of very professional graphic design. It's generally easy to find what you're looking for.

If you're already a fan of the Iron Kingdoms, you might find that it's a little lacking in flavor; compared to even the Character Guide for D&D, there's not much lore - just one section on the world and one on its history. It needs more, more, more! That's the main selling point of the book, because...

+Flashy character options - lots of ways to customize your character's flavor
- Not enough character options: There's really not that many abilities to choose from, and when it comes to statistics they're all incredibly narrow. This is a holdover from the Warmachine system.

+Great use of combat, skirmish rules
-High focus on combat, skirmish rules - seriously, almost every single spell is designed to be used in combat and only combat

Overall, this is basically what they thought people wanted - they made a weird hybrid of D&D 4e and their Warmachine tabletop game. It's a great product but they played it really safe.",3.0
"This review is of the book itself, and not the game. The game system is amazing, and the content offered is detailed, in-depth, and copious. I have almost no complaints with how well the game itself is.

I do have major complaints about the production quality of the written material. This book is sloppy, plain and simple. Spelling errors abound; I stopped counting after reaching 5 on a single page. Worse is the recycled material. In the language section, there is a sentence under Khardic languages that appears twice in two different places, word-for-word. There is also repetitive material throughout, but less obvious. Also recycled is artwork. And not just from other source material, but from inside the same book. For example, the artwork for the Priest profession is also appears in the Gun Mage spell list section. They also zoom in and crop full-page artwork which they then recycle in other areas. And the artwork for the races is just plain awful. There is also a lot of confusion on some of the rules that need clarification.

Overall the game is great and a must-have if you want to run it. However, I'd say wait for at least a second printing where the typographical issues can be fixed at the very least.",3.0
"the flaw of the systems is that the books 'give away' the answers fairly easily.  everything about the system gives you the feel of high quality production value but the books tell you what to look for and once your kid figures that part of it out, the value sinks exponentially.  They have to erase the template on each page.  My kid has become very successful at but it's only because she figured out the 'trick' on how to solve it.  ridiculously bad design flaw.",3.0
"The puzzle pieces are a bit bigger than I expected, but that was nice since I got it for my six year old. However, I was disappointed that some of the pieces were bent. Maybe 4-6 pieces were actually curved like they have been badly bent. This was strange since the box was wrapped and the pieces came inside a sealed bag within the box. It must have been some error in production/packaging. I was able to straighten them but they are wrinkled and not perfectly flat.",3.0
Found it too complicated for her needs.,3.0
"I ordered these to use with one or two students at a time.  The disks themselves are fine - no complaints.  However, to be truly usable, there would need to be many more ones and tens disks.  There are only enough one disks to do the smallest problems - there aren't enough to regroup - especially when doing division problems - and that is just when one person is using them.  More than half of the set is larger numbers which I will probably only use occasionally.  To make this set work I now  have to either buy another set, which is expensive,  or face cutting out many little circles out of craft foam.",3.0
"Initially, I planned on making these myself with a circle die cut and different colored construction paper. I decided that the paper discs would be to flimsy and bothersome to grasp. I purchased these feeling assured that they were specifically referencing Singapore Math (which is the program we use). Low and behold we receive the product and sit down for our first lesson, only to realize we are missing the entire 20 discs of the thousands and a few from the other place values. Honestly, if we were missing a few from each, I would not have bothered--but an entire place value?! I applied for a replacement, which is a simple process, but I am just annoyed that we have to delay our lesson....As far as the actual product, the discs are colorful, durable and easy to grip. I will be glad when a full set arrives.",3.0
"item as described, 36 different artists, each with a match for a total of 72 cards.

A neat way to introduce art, wish tiles were higher quality, cool though!!",3.0
A good jumping off point for planning STEM activities and lesson plans. Still need thought as to how to plan for the pre school child and classroom as my school requires.,3.0
"My daughter and I are fans of ""The Hunger Games Trilogy."" I used my birthday gift card to make this purchase, sure that any game featuring the tributes and events from the books would be entertaining to share as a family. In some ways it lived up to expectations; in others, it fell flat.

Pro: The game is packaged nicely and colorfully, with some good concepts about the different districts and players.
Con: It would've been nice to actually use names of characters from the books, and some of the colors and numbers are easily confused in real-time play.

Pro: Using the training days as a setting for the game is not bad, and it does conjure some memories from the books.
Con: It would've made the game more gripping to plant it squarely in the middle of the actual Hunger Games, with life and death on the line.

Pro: The game does attempt to use some imagination and allow players some choices, in a minor form of a role-playing game.
Con: Aside from choosing how to assign your chips and attributes, you have no way to stir creativity in regards to actual actions of any sort.

The first time my daughter and I played the game, we were disappointed at its lack of scope, but we couldn't resist trying it again. Although we still play it once or twice a month, we play three or four games of Narnia Stratego before coming back to this underdeveloped effort. It's really only for the die-hard fans.",3.0
"So I'm wandering through my local bookstore and decide to check out the Young Adult shelves, and I stop dead in my tracks.  ""Seriously?"" I ask myself, ""No, really.  Seriously?  A Hunger Games board game?""  But there it was.  My eyes gave proof to the reality.  My friends, it is true: there is a Hunger Games board game.  Why does it exist?  The cynic in me acknowledges that with the final book due to hit shelves later this month, the games arrival in stores (along with t-shirts and mockingjay pins) is hardly a coincidence.

If you haven't read the books, don't bother with the game.  It's not for you.  If you have read the books, then whether or not this *is* for you depends on how much you like the books.  I consider myself to be an avid fan, yet I purchased it primarily out of curiosity.  It's inexpensive as far as games go ($20) and it certainly wouldn't be the worst impulse purchase I've ever made. (That honor probably goes to a Pog collector's kit purchased when I was in 7th grade.  Remember Pogs?  No?  Figures.)

But the game.  Yes, the game.

""The Hunger Games: Training Days"" itself does not involve the arena, but -- as the title suggests -- focuses on the days of training.  Predicably, you assume the role of a tribute from one of the districts of Panem.  The winner of the game is the one who finishes training with the most popularity with the Capitol audience.  Each round, several ""event"" cards are turned up.  These can be straightforward (Show off your knot-tying ability), to forging an alliance with another tribute (thereby gaining some of their talents), to special (opening ceremonies, the reaping).  After the cards have been turned up, players will take turns bidding on the event they want.  Win an event, and your favor with the capitol audience rises.  Fail to win the event, and your effort goes wasted.

Ultimately, I admit that I found there to be genuine strategy to it.  There were many times when there's the ""safe"" play of devoting yourself to winning a single card, but...if you play things just right, it's possible to take them all.  Of course, if that goes wrong, you may end up with nothing.  There were some turns I spent considerable time thinking about my play.  I enjoy games that make me think, and consider that to be a mark in this game's favor.

Unfortunately, there are some flaws.  The tributes are not at all balanced.  (Hint: You want to be the female tribute from District 12)  I can understand wanting to maintain integrity with the book, but as Katniss so often mentions during her time in the arena, the Hunger Games are hardly fair.  I wouldn't go so far as to call the game unfair, but it certainly isn't balanced.  As an example: each tribute has certain events that they can claim automatic victory.  However, some tributes (such as the female from 12) can do this for cards that are significantly more valuable than the cards other tributes are able to win.

The other flaw with the game is the font and type size on the cards.  It is very difficult to read the cards from any distance greater than 12 inches.  They are fine when the cards are in front of you, but since many of your decisions will be influenced by the cards that others possess, expect to spend *alot* of time asking ""What does that card do?"" and ""Can I see that again?""  Also, though the game indicates 2-6 players, try to bring 4 to your first session.  That's really where the best balance appears to be.

In the end though, I enjoyed the game, and will play it again.  It's a novelty item: better than some I've seen, but not the worst either.

The choice of whether to pick this up depends entirely on your level of fandom.  Really, you probably made the decision the moment you realized the game existed.  I will say this though -- if you're thinking about picking this up, get it soon, as I can't imagine this game will be in print for very long.  If you do pick it up, well then....good luck, and may the odds ever be in your favor!",3.0
"Looks nice, but not as big as the red or the white in the evolution packs, and is just as costly for this one figure as those sets are for three.  It's not a bad figure at all - just a little small for the cost... a little unimpressive for the cost.  The red and the white sets are very nice.  And the gargantuan green is well worth it.",3.0
I purchased this game for my husband last year. We picked up how to play it pretty quickly but it was kinda boring and repetitive.,3.0
I was really excited to try this game. Bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and we tried playing it with his family. But it took forever and everyone was confused. We haven't played it since.,3.0
"This was a nice game to play, but I would not play it all the time like I would some games. If you are a Back to the Future fan, then it's a nice game to have.",3.0
"This game was fun for a couple rounds, but you quickly learn what cards to flip first in order to win.  It's very predictable and gets quite boring with just two people.",3.0
"But the replay on this is very limited. We bought this because we liked Fluxx and my husband loves the BTTF movies. I don't care much for this game, but he seems to love it.",3.0
"It is Back to the Future Chrononauts.  In some ways it is easier than the original.  Sometimes that ease can mean people are working more at cross purposes.  It is very fun, but unless you want to educate your child about Back to the Future, it is not very educational.  Also, it is cards so play carefully.",3.0
Fun once or twice..but grows old (could mix with other Fluxx decks as needed though). Cards need more actions/powers to create a greater variety of strategies.,3.0
"Not as fun as the other Fluxx games. My favorite is Space Fluxx.
But if you live in kansas like I do, where Dorothy is the most famous resident, this game version is a necessity.",3.0
"This game is kind of boring, probably more fun with 3 or more players. Lots of great science fiction humor.",3.0
My first fluxx game.  Its okay. Could be more creative in the writing and artwork.  Both are somewhat bland.,3.0
"Ive seen people play this game and I know its a fun, deceptive game to play at parties while drunk. HOWEVER!! It came with no rules or instructions!! I don't think its the sellers fault maybe just the packaging.",3.0
"I kinda figured that this product would come in better packaging like a deck of cards normally does. This comes essentially a cardboard envelope. The cards are OK, but they are in black/white and don't have the instructions for each card on the card like I've seen with other versions. It is a decent price, but I feel like it would have been better to spend a few more bucks and get a better version.",3.0
"It got old fast, but everyone I play games with still likes it.",3.0
rules are very confusing and i've played other versions of fluxx,3.0
"A friend of mine introduced me to the wonder of Fluxx. And I really loved it. The game's ever changing rules definitely make each play completely different. I played firefly Fluxx and enjoyed it. Star Fluxx tries it's best to touch upon many different franchises while not having the copyright rights to them. Now that's not he problem, but after playing a newer version of Fluxx, playing an older version I'm not used to the unpolished look to the cards, and there seems to be less rules and more goals and keeper cards that add more complexity over the game. Not my favorite deck but I'm still glad I own it.",3.0
"Other Fluxx games I've played seem to have more Creepers which help the game stay challenging. This one only has two. The accent card is fun, but get's old pretty quick. I definitely like the original and Batman Fluxx games better.",3.0
This version of Fluxx is for the hard core gamer who loves Fluxx. I do not recommend this for the person who just picks up the Fluxx line. The rules are very specific and sometimes hard to follow.  We got to complete our Fluxx collection but is a bit above our heads as casual gamers.,3.0
"Played this a few times and can get a little crazy in game play with new rules and goals/ungoals, but not a bad game.  I would HIGHLY recommend getting ""Hastur the Unspeakable"" Promo card, and maybe a few others if REALLY want to add some fun to the game.

UPDATE:
I read reviews about this game fore deciding to purchase it.  While I feel Cthulhu themes, like zombies, has been overdone I bought this Fluxx due to a review that said it was the best out of all other versions they played.  While it is nice to have a game that has a chance to win, it turned out to be a nice way to make the game end faster after it seemed to drag on and on, wither from not having the right cards to having a creeper out on your field.  The randomness of the game made it feel more like you needed luck than anything else to win.  Having played 3-4times it now sits on my shelf collecting dust, even after buying some extra promo cards. Sadly live and learn, but I could not recommend this game if you want a clear cut way to win without sitting there for a long time just to get to an end.",3.0
"Not as much fun as Pirate or Zombie Fluxx, in our opinion. Maybe avid Cthulhu fans get more enjoyment from it.",3.0
I personally like the other Fluxx games better.  My family just loves the Fluxx games.  It replaced all the other card games similiar to it.  Monster Fluxx I love!  Plan on getting a few others.  This one I got cuz it looked weird but honestly I like  Monster Fluxx the best.  Started with that one and  glad I did.,3.0

"I thought this game was going to be a lot of fun, I've had heard great things about it but after playing a few games, it's just MEH, not that good.",3.0
"This game has 2 rules and no end case, so if everyone at the table is paying attention it can be hard for this game to ever end.  As a result it usually out lives how fun it is.  That being said if you like silly cards and piratey things it is a fun game to play while someone preps the next game of the evening",3.0
"The game is pretty fun, but with all of the rule changes it gets difficult to really put together much of a strategy for any given game. Fun for a few quick games with friends, but there isn't really enough depth to warrant constant play.",3.0
Got old after a few games.,3.0
"The game is exponentially more complex than the regular fluxx so you may wanna think twice before purchasing this one. You need to keep many many variables in mind when playing, and is very easy to miss a restriction or a possibility of a good play due to this.",3.0
"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win, until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature.",3.0
"We struggle to work with this game, though it's fun even through the struggles.  The rules change constantly, the goals change constantly, the play changes constantly - and the pirate theme, while kind of fun, gets a little old.  I think if I was a little less anal and a little more flexible, I would enjoy it more.  As it is, I don't really enjoy it because I need at least a little structure.  My 12 year old and my husband like it pretty well, though.",3.0
I am a Fluxx fan.  Love them game but the variety of cards in this pack are limited.  Works if you use it as an expansion pack I suppose.,3.0
"I like fluxx. Expected better from StarFluxx. But still playable. Zombies and Pirates all day, Cuthulu is the most complex",3.0
"After having played a number of games of numerous themes of Fluxx, it gets pretty old. It end quickly or TAKES FOREVER! I have much preferred We Didn't Playtest This At All when it comes to an absurd filler game, it scales better, plays quicker and has more humor to it.",3.0
"This card game that is quick with more luck than strategy. Good for a filler game between games, while waiting for something to start,and has humor in the cards for those versed in Star Trek and Star Wars. So their are jokes and one liners from the star theme.",3.0
"We really enjoy the Fluxx games. This version has some funny cards that relate to favorite science fiction movies/shows. However the game play did not compare to Martian Fluxx for us. Star Fluxx does not have as many Creeper cards and the Little Fuzzy keeper was not as powerful/effective as we'd hoped. Still in our regular circulation of games.

We're going to try Cthulhu Fluxx next.",3.0
"I purchased this game after watching Wil Wheaton's YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6C1CBXPvc). I was looking for a game that was simple to learn and wouldn't take forever to play. What could be simpler that a game with just 2 rules - draw a card, play a card?

After playing this game several times and trying to like it, I found that it just didn't grab me. Every single time I played it I felt like I was, for lack of a better word, wandering aimlessly trying to figure out how to win. You see, the rules change every time a card is played, so developing a strategy is difficult. That wouldn't be a huge issue, but it seemed that every time I played, someone would play a card and, out of the blue, s/he would win. It happened every time and it was within just a few minutes of playing the game.

You might be thinking that it's just how things worked out for me, but I tried this game with some ""hardcore"" gamers and it happened then too. I had 3 games I tried with them: Zombie Dice, Tsuro, and Star Fluxx. They did enjoy all three, but no one really wanted to play this game over and over.

I've been told that Monty Python Fluxx is much more fun, but I think I'll skip the Fluxx series.",3.0
"I picked this up for a relative after having played the original Fluxx years ago.  There's a lot of cool, funny, clever stuff in this deck.  Unfortunately, with all the complexity they introduced they also created a lot of ambiguities.  The entire backside of a the long rule sheet is a FAQ.  Basically, it's all to try to address various ambiguities and loopholes.  I found even more of these FAQs online.  To me, this takes away a lot of the spirit of the game, which is that the basic rules are minimal and the cards tell you what to do.  Instead, the cards bring up questions they never address.  We ran into two ambiguities that dared to cause a ragequit each time because there was no way to resolve it without some higher authority having addressed it.

I'd recommend sticking to the basic Fluxx, if they even sell it any more.  It looks like they even added complexity to Fluxx 4.0 that might cause the same problem.  The entire idea of Fluxx is complicated enough that it doesn't need ambiguity like this piled on top of it.",3.0

"Of all the different types of games there are to play, there are some that I just inherently enjoy more than others. Deck-builders fall into that category. In a deck-builder, generally everyone starts with the same small deck of cards (usually 10). Throughout the game, you use those cards as resources/currency to purchase more cards, which allow you to buy even more cards and eventually score enough points to win the game. They are simple to learn and quick to play. Today, I would like to tell you about one from Tasty Minstrel Games called Flip City and its expansion Flip City: Reuse. In Flip City, you are using your deck of cards to build and improve the neighborhoods in Flip City, carefully balancing how quickly to build and how much to collect in taxes. The game plays 1-4 players, ages 8+. It retails for $20 for the base game and $10 for the expansion, and can take 30 minutes to an hour to play. Let's get to the setup!

Setup - All cards are double-sided, so make sure you are using the correct sides during setup.
1. Form the Starting Decks - Give each player 4 Residential Area cards, and 1 each of the following - Convenience Store, Factory, Apartment, Hospital, and Central Park. (Note: When playing with the expansion add 1 each of Plumber Shop and Flea Market.)
2. Form the General Supply - Form the following stacks of cards in the middle of the table: 12 Convenience Stores, 12 Hospitals, 8 Factories, and 8 Central Parks. You may also optionally include the 10 Offices. (Note: When playing with the expansion add 10 each of Plumber Shops and Flea Markets.)
3. Starting player is said to be whoever last flipped a table, but I prefer to just pick randomly.

Game Play - During your turn, there are two specific phases. Play then passes clockwise. The game is won when one player gains 8 points (denoted by a medal symbol).
1. Play Cards Phase - Play cards from the top of your deck onto the table one at a time. Check each card for additional rules/functions. Cards you play can provide you with cash (coin symbol), points (medal symbol), and/or unhappiness (frowny face symbol). After each card, you must decide whether to play an additional card or not. (Note: You may look at the top of your deck when deciding).
a. If your deck runs out of card, you can stop or shuffle your discard pile and continue.
b. You can have a maximum of two unhappiness. If you reach three unhappiness, your turn ends immediately and all played cards go into your discard pile.
c. If you have any cards in your discard pile with a down green arrow, you may recycle those cards by flipping them to gain their effect on the other side of the card.

2.  Building Phase - With the cash you gained from your Play Card Phase, you may choose one of the following actions.
a. Buy - Choose a card in the General Supply. Pay its cost (found in the top right corner), and put the card into your discard pile.
b. Flip - Choose a card in your discard pile. Pay its Flip Fee (found in the bottom right corner), and turn the card over to its other side. The card will remain into your Discard Pile.
c. Develop - Choose a card in the General Supply. Pay its Flip Fee to turn the card over, and put it into your discard pile.

Review
At its core, Flip City is a typical deck-builder in that you are using cards to buy other cards to score points and win. HOWEVER, that is where the game stops being a typical deck-builder. For starters, the cards are double-sided. This means you have access to twice as many cards in half the space. It also gives you interesting choices to make, like whether you should flip a card or not. Second, you are not limited to a hand of five cards each round. You can keep playing cards until you choose to stop or are forced to stop. This is known as a ""press your luck"" element. I'm a bit of a chicken when it comes to this game element, but it can pay off big time, if you're lucky. Lastly, there is a ""take that"" element in the game, which allows you to mess with other players. This is seen slightly in the base game with the Apartment card, because you can load up your opponent's deck with Residential Areas, which produces more unhappiness for them. It can really be seen in the expansion with the Plumber Shop, especially in a three or four player game, because you can discard the top cards from their decks and make them potentially start with fewer coins or points and more unhappiness.

This is a clever little card game that tweaks your traditional deck-builder just enough to make it a fresh game mechanic. The expansion, as noted earlier, provides some more ""take that"" action, but also provides you with ways to generate more cash and have a little bit more control of your deck and discard pile. The cards of nice quality, which is vital in a deck-builder, because these cards are going to be shuffled...A LOT! The artwork feels a bit retro, like an NES game, but it serves its purpose without distracting from the game play. With a decent price point and a unique twist on deck-building, Flip City and its expansion Flip City: Reuse are worthy additions to the genre and worth trying if you enjoy deck-builders.",3.0
"This is a small card game that combines ""push your luck"" and deck building mechanics.  Each player starts with a deck of 9 cards with 5 piles of cards in the center of the table.  On a player's turn they play cards form the top of their deck to accumulate coins, points, unhappiness, and other abilities.  You can only accumulate 2 unhappiness before you bust and lose your turn.  You can always see what the next card you will get is but some require you to draw them if they are the top card of your deck so if you're not careful you could be forced to draw into a bust.

The name of the game comes from the fact that all the cards are double sided.  With the coins you accumulate on a turn you can do one of 3 actions.  Buy a card from the center, flip a card in your discard pile, or buy and flip a card from the center.  The goal is to accumulate 8 points in a round without busting or playing a certain card with 18 other cards in a single round.

The mechanics of this game combine pretty well and it is a neat idea.  There is a little wonkiness when actually playing this in practice.  Since when you shuffle your deck you can't see what your top card is going to be people have to shuffle under the table or force themselves to look around the room or at the ceiling.  And while it hasn't happened yet, once person dropping their deck of cards could mean they can't finish the game since orientation is so important.

I had two issues with the game.  The first is that for a super simple filler game it took a bit longer than I would have wanted.  30-50 minutes is what BGG lists and that's probably close to accurate.  A game like this shouldn't take over 30 minutes.  The other is that the 5 stacks of cards that you can buy are all that you have in this game.  There are no other options.  For a deck builder that can make for a game that gets stale very fast, imagine if Dominion only had 5 different Kingdom cards to play with.

The art is also not anything to write home about.  I like the ideas but the game is in a weird place where it takes too long for a quick filler and doesn't have enough content to make me want to play it in any other capacity.",3.0

"My 12 year old son got this for Christmas.  The idea is interesting, but it is hard to figure out how to play due to the confusing directions.  Hard to shuffle cards when you have to make sure the same side is up.  We played it several times and didn't feel like playing it again.  Maybe we'll pick it up again sometime, but right now people like other games better in our family, so it is relegated to the pile .",3.0
"The jury is still out on this game. There's not really a lot going on, so I'd definitely label this as a beginner game. I've only played it a couple times as a two-player game. I'll check back when I play 3+ players, but I don't think it's going to get much more interesting.",3.0
"Great concept that needs a good polishing.  Each player gets a store card. Unfortunately the print on everything is VERY small, so the other players cannot read each other's storefront specs. The cards in the middle of the table, between players, also have that problem. reading & knowing what the options are on the cards is crucial to playing, so this is a big deal. One of the players in our group mentioned that the ""engine"" is very slow in this game. It is very hard to get the right combination to earn the store front cards, which means that the cost & the worth of the storefront cards needs to be adjusted. There are at least 3 cards that readjust the worth of your goods & 1 tax card that can be used over & over. These cards slow the game down so much that everyone frequently finds they are starting a turn with no goods on their card. they need to go back & redo the rules & or the cards to make this a game you would play twice.",3.0
"Gullsbottom isn't just a silly word that makes you giggle.  Its a hustling and bustling port city rife with economic promise for an opportunistic entrepreneur like you.  Can you muscle in, stake a claim in its most lucrative businesses, and corner the market to rule the Harbour?  Before the dock-loaders strike?

How it Plays

In Harbour, players collect and convert goods which they then sell to buy buildings.  It is pure resource management design in which efficiency is key.  Achieving that productivity is another matter, though, as supply and demand is constantly fluctuating.  The dock-master who plays this volatile market most shrewdly is likely to be king of the port.

Players begin with one building and a few resources.  This is a good old, American rags-to-riches success story, despite slipping that superfluous u into the title.  Goods can be wood, stone, livestock, or fish.  Everyone can start with the same generic building.  However, after one game I recommend the variant in which everyone has a different building with a unique ability.

Also around the harbor (note the proper English spelling) is a row of buildings with varying benefits that are available to use  or buy, as you can afford them.  A turn consists of moving your little proprietor to any unoccupied building in play  including one owned by another player, even his/her starting business.  However, you must pay its owner one resource for the privilege.

When you select a building, you resolve its action.  Most allow you to either collect resources or convert some of what you have into other resources.  You keep track of your inventory on a personal player board, which also denotes and explains your starting building.  Some businesses, especially the ones you begin with, allow you to buy another from the central pool.  Your harbor guy is not the monopoly guy  other players must pay you for the buildings benefits, if they wish to use it.  Its also worth points, which will be important later.

To purchase a building, you sell resources.  The catch is that their values constantly change.  There is a central market that tracks what the going rate is for each good.  This track is numbered 2-5, which each resource beginning the game randomly on one of these values.  When selling, you must have a number of an item equal to its value in the market.  So if stone is set in the 4 spot, you must have 4 stone.  Ship them all off and earn $4 towards the purchase of a building.  If you only have 3 stone, you cant sell any.  If you actually have 5 stone, you must ship them all.  And, well sorry, but you still only profit $4  thanks for the donation and, I gave at the office, is no excuse.  Then things start happening.  The market cycles.  Whatever goods you just sold get bumped down to the lower market values, while those beneath are increased to take their place.  The opponent to your left who was also sitting on 4 stone is now crying and probably wants to burn down your wharf.

Players continue in this manner  collecting and converting, not crying  trying to take advantage of the different buildings, keeping a close eye on the market and generally enjoying the sunny breeze and salt air.  As soon as one player purchases his/her fourth building, each opponent takes one more turn and the game ends.  Whoever has the most valuable buildings becomes Master of the Harbour  and has to deal with the ILWU.

How Does it Play?

One of my favorite shows is the long-running Whose Line Is It Anyway? in which the host famously declares, Everythings made up and the points don't matter!  Often times Ill borrow and slightly twist that phrase before teaching (Euro) games.  In that case, Everythings made up and the theme doesnt matter.  In Harbour, the points actually matter.  The theme?  No so much.

This design is resource management pure and simple.  Although not always so simple because the market constantly vacillates and the action you want at any given moment may be occupied or owned by another.  Instead, its a rather puzzle-like workout that can be rather random.  Youll stumble across purchases through speculation and by chance just as often as you will via shrewd planning.  You can generally foresee one purchase ahead, which is fine if you're next up to the counter.  If not, well, its nearly impossible to determine how resource values will change.

Not only that, but sales aren't the only thing that can spook the market.  Some buildings actions let your rearrange the values of one or more goods.  While I enjoy the vagaries of the market and praise it for spicing up the generally lackluster resource management mechanic, this element is actually just plain frustrating.  Sometimes, players will legitimately employ the action to create a market favorable to their inventory.  Hopefully no one else messes with it before you can capitalize.  However, just as often theyll use it to wreck their neighbors plans.  Normally I welcome spiteful elements, but here it just tacks an extra layer of pain when you're already at the whims of an ever-changing market.

To be fair, there are some ways to manipulate the games economy.  Buildings have one or more important icons that bestow various benefits.  The top hat allows you to use another players building for free.  The coin reduces the cost of future purchases and is cumulative.  A warehouse allows you to retain one resource when selling and is also cumulative.  Finally, an anchor symbol typically allows you to collect or convert extra resources when resolving appropriate actions.  While it may not completely calm a capricious market, it at least gives some control  or an illusion of it.

Harbours greatest strength or asset is probably its variability.  For a light to medium weight game, it has a delightfully high replay value.  For one, there are several different starting player boards each with a unique building and special ability.  Second, there are tons of different buildings to use as actions and to purchase.  You won't come close to using them all in one session and each game will present lots of different options and fun synergies.  If you discover any wonky combos or overpowered abilities, well, then customize the next game as you see fit.

This one hums along fairly well with quick resolving actions.  You can hit a few hiccups along the way.  Really, Id expect as much considering all the options available.  That can increase as the game develops and even more buildings come out to replace those bought.  Indeed, theres a fun ramp up as the game progresses with increasingly ever more to do.  But as the end game is triggered by the purchase of a fourth building, it all sort of grinds to halt just as you're getting oiled up.  However, play finishes in an hour or less and it feels satisfyingly right given its style and nature.

Harbour shines best as a 2-3 player game for casual gamers, especially one bridging the gap to players more experienced in the hobby.  It has some depth and requires players to assess a wide range of options.  So its not a filler or micro game.  The bull and bear market will likely frustrate serious-seeking only Euro gamers.  Its also not a gateway game because, again, that market.  It can be difficult to grasp for novice gamers and some of the iconography to denote building actions is unintuitive.  Finally, fair warning if you're thinking about treading into a 4-player session: they're rather chaotic and the difficulties of playing the market are increased tenfold.

The theme is certainly insignificant, but helps give the design some flavor.  Overall, Harbour is a quaint and humorous homage to standard fantasy tropes and the cartoony artwork is wonderful.  The cards are of a nice stock and quality.  The tokens are stickered wooden cubes.  The rule book is adequate.  Most attractive of all, the price point is extremely reasonable.

Harbour is a solid step up for newer or casual gamers.  Ive heard it described as a filler and/or a micro game, but it really offers more meat and depth than Id associate with those categories.  And Im not sure Id recommend it as a gateway game simply because the market mechanic requires some familiarity, plus it and the icons are not very intuitive.  And don't play with 4  its way uncontrollable.  However, once youve got a couple of games under your sailors hat, this design hits a sweet spot between casual play and medium complexity.  Resource management games aren't generally exciting exercises.  Yet Harbours quick pace, variety, and quirky market put a little zip into the genre.

Pros:
Good next step game
Moves at a nice pace, never slow
Variability in starting buildings
Surprisingly good replay value for its style/weight
Range of options expands and builds, but

Cons:
Feels like it can end just as its ramping up
No player aids
Tough to plan ahead because market cycles
Iconography and market are not immediately intuitive
Small amount of interaction more frustrating than fun",3.0
"There are some fantastic characters added in this expansion, as well as more than a few that are head-scracters, to say the least. Overall not a bad first expansion, it just seems that the 'good' characters were hold-backs from the base game and the others were half-hearted attempts to fill out 8 cards. I don't know how the choices were made on what to include in the base game and what were earmarked for expansion(s) but after purchasing the base game and this expansion, it just feels like the hero cards were gerrymandered a bit so that you're always gonna get a mix of 'REALLY USEFUL' and 'WTF' in every set of heroes. But hey, for $5, what was I expecting?

My recommendation: if you play with a large group, or play frequently enough that the extra heroes would freshen your game, go for it ... otherwise it may not add much to your DR experience.

The only real decisions that are left to the players is whether or not to shift up or down but really there's not a lot of decisions to make there.  Most players will be left shifting in the exact same way on each turn and all that's left then is luck of the roll.

This game does accommodate a good number of players though and looks good with a lot of content and some really solid pieces.

Buy it for the controller, which is worth $20.",3.0
"obviously a cheap setup, the controller lasted one day before it would connect anymore, cable was no good. when I attempted to solder another cable on, the solder pads melted off of the board and then I gave up on it. the simulator itself is great, lots of models and landscapes can be acquired online, I got a PPM usb device for my professional transmitters because it doesn't fly right with anything else I have, waiting for that to arrived, I'm bummed about the transmitter lasting only one day, especially with NO abuse to it whatsoever, hardly even used it.",3.0
I did not like it. I returned it.,3.0
Limited use! Windows XP only! I knew that going in. Just didn't antisapte blue screen coming so soon. Oh well! (couldn't repair computer).,3.0
"The software that comes with the package is on a small disc and did not work well. I found other sims on the net that worked better, but I have not been able to find one that has a tricopter in it. This is what I really wanted. I hope this help.

Can't get the software to work on my system which is listed on the box.,3.0
"You basically get a ""Controller"" for your money. I couldn't get anything to work from just the disk. I had to find a missing ""DLL"" file on the internet to even try using the system. After that, none of the helicopter simulations would work so I contacted the company. They provided a link to another simulation that I could download for free. It worked, but only after ""calibrating"" the controller. That was a feat in itself considering the terrible instructions. I think that you could do the same thing if you had a 2 stick game controller of any type that hooks to your computer. This unit didn't cost much so I suppose it's OK for practicing. The simulations are pretty realistic and could save you some crash repairs on a real plane or helicopter.",3.0
"It seems to work ""OK"" - does what it is supposed to do, minimally.  It looks and has the ""feel"" of something of very low quality.
I think if I had paid about $5-6 for it . instead of $15, I'd give it a higher rating.  My advice - look for something of higher quality.
Unfortunately, there isn't much choice out there.",3.0
Software is horrible but there are several free ones on the web to use. The controller is nice however I still crash my planes in real life so I am not so sure it has helped my much.,3.0
"The software worked on my computer; it's running Windows 7 64-bit. I don't really like it that much, so I'm using the Clearview SE simulator that I found free online. I never found any uses for the 5th and 6th channel which are the knobs which is a bummer. The software that I was using didn't even pick up on the 6th channel as I believe it's broken (I bought this as new). I kind of wish they made it closer to the Spectrum controllers, but I guess cheap is cheap I suppose. It did help me prepare myself for flying 4 channel airplanes, but nothing comes close to the real thing. It gave me inspiration and the confidence to go ahead and buy the micro Trojan and micro Mustang along with the DX6i remote on eBay.

If you want to start flying four channel planes, I recommend starting here first. After here, decide if you want to buy a luxury simulator or use that same amount of money to buy a RTF plane... Your choice I suppose.",3.0
"The controller works. I have it running on Windows 7 with the ClearView simulator (which is not free).
It did not work on windows 7 with the FMS software that came with it. That software is old. It came with FMS alpha 7. alpha 8.5 is available online.
It has 2 switches on top. The right switch didn't work on mine.
The cable is 3 feet long, which is short for a joystick.
Looking at the case, you might think there are trim adjustments, but they are just plastic decorations.
Documentation is in English, but includes illegible low resolution screen shots in Chinese.
The sticks are centering, except the left vertical, which is used for throttle.",3.0
"Mine arrived with both of the toggle switches on the top edge non-functional. I'm an electronics guy so this wasn't a big deal, I opened it up and found to my surprise that both switches themselves were in fact defective and replaced them with some similar switches I had in my junk box. It used to be most people interested in R/C models knew how to use a soldering iron but I don't know if that's the case anymore and for a brand new unit to have two defective switches out of the box surprised me. Aside from that, the build quality is about what I'd expect for the price, and on par with the transmitters included with inexpensive R/C toys. Good enough to do the job and it should hold up fine if you don't abuse it.

Anyone considering this should know that it's intended as an educational tool to train prospective R/C pilots so don't expect top notch graphics and sound like the latest PC games. That said, the included freeware FMS software is very old and crude by today's standards but it will do the job in a pinch. If you have a reasonably modern PC with Windows 7 or later, there are other (non-free) software packages that are much better.

Once everything is up and running, this is a great tool and will pay for itself very quickly compared to the money you would spend crashing models. Experienced R/C pilots make it look easy but it's really not! Stick at it for a few weeks with the simulator and you'll get the hang of it and be ready to take a real R/C plane or heli out for a spin.",3.0
but the program won't work on my pc / it is to old. not bad not good but it works,3.0
"Considering it's been a long time since I used a r/c tr I thought I should try this first before getting back into the fun. If your not very comfortable with program set up This might not be a good choice. Absolutely no instructions. The good people who posted reviews here are valuable sources to help you set it up so its usable. Thanks everyone.
Once it's set up its fair enough for the price. I used to have Great planes but the disks were stolen long ago. It's a lot more expensive and it shows. The free soft ware on the disk would not load. I down loaded from the Internet and after a few flights it stops. I think it's 35.00 to buy the software.",3.0
"I tested this out with Realflight G2 on a windows 7 PC.  The device drivers installed automatically.
It took A LOT of tweaking the program settings, calibrating, adjusting servo rates (in program) etc etc to get it to work right.

If you are up for this using whatever RC flight program you had in mind then it's a great cheap controller.
BTW the controller has 2 channels for the sticks.  You have to find which one your program wants to see on all controls.
Otherwise your ailerons might be your throttle, your rudder your elevator, etc etc ... and it might need reversed in settings.

There are no working manual trims.  All those are just plastic case molding.",3.0
Flying planes was pretty easy. Had trouble setting up helicopter controls. Had to use an Esky control I had lying around.,3.0
"There are 6 channels (2 are on/off switches) on the box.  The trims are non-functional and broke with light pressure (does not affect operation of ""transmitter"".  I was able to configure the device to use MS Flight Simulator X and was able to ""fly"" the planes and helicopter.  I was not able to run the included software on Win7.

The transmitter works as a training aide (worth 4 stars), but the software did not, so down 1 star.  There are others that will probably work better than this unit.  For the price, and temporary intended use, it works for me.",3.0
"I bought this one from a US supplier and it arrved quickly. It does work but is very quirky. It doesn't have trim adjustment tabs, just fixed plastic knobs. Works OK for kids but not really a very good simulator. It works well with Clearview SE software forget the disk software that comes with it.
I ordered another different one from a chinese supplier and am still waiting on it 3 weeks later.",3.0
"Remember you are buying the controller not the software. The software is free !.

I think I got a good price on the controller.",3.0
"I recieved this FS from E-Sky. It is somewhat easy to install on your PC. It is a non-GUI type install and you have to figure out how to properly install it on the PC. Once you do, setting up the controls is confusing. I had to do a YOUTUBE on how to set it up. After all that, it's OK.",3.0
"Bought this just a week ago and have used it twice. First it will work with windows 7, after you go online and get help. You Tube has alot of info available. The fact that there are very few aircraft, dosn't look realistic at all makes it less fun. I recommend spending more, to get more.",3.0
"If you are buying a flight simulator this is not your product. What they are selling is just a remote control emulator for an RC simulator. What they provide is a disk with FMS which is a freeware RC flight simulator that is old, sucks and doesn't run in Vista or Windows 7, you can make it run editing the windows registry (not recommended unless you know what you are doing), after doing all the windows hacking i ended up with a hideous old simulator. I ended up downloading ClerView another simulator ($39), which i like and the RC remote emulator work fine with this program.
Hope it helps",3.0
"I have this on my XP system and it will not work with Vista nor can I find any downloads or updates to make it work. Be forewarned. Other than that, it did teach me to fly RC Planes! I loved it so much I went and bought the Real Flight Simulator. I really love that unit.",3.0

 Well let me end on a good note,the simulated radio worked fine with just plug & play. I purchased the sim software from another company(Clea-Vie,these two words are missing a letter each.),it's beautiful.

"I was dumb and didn't read closely to see the obvious signs of it being a bootleg. It's smaller than the actual product and looks noticeably different. Also, the box got messed up during shipping. It arrived in a flimsy package but I think the post office did that so I don't blame the sender. I wound up giving it to my friend who doesn't mind bootlegs and bought the real one. Three stars because it's okay for what it is and I should have payed more attention when reading the description.",3.0
"Unlike the Sebastian Bootleg that Amazon also sells the quality in this one is a bit off. For example on the neck you can really see that it is a bootleg because it has a line running through the middle and the color in the neck is way off. The figure itself is adorable, the only thing that bugs me is the neck. Other than that part if you set it in a way that you cant really see it it look completely alright. Same price as the Sebastian bootleg but the Sebastian bootleg is better quality, still this one for the price it does not disappoint. Recommend only if you really do not ind owning a bootleg, for me this was fine because the price is alright and I can just hide the neck, but if you are extremely picky then this is not for you. The box it came with was in bad shape, it was torn and squished, it took about a week to get to my house from China.",3.0
"To be honest, this is very well made even though it'd a bootleg. I examined the figure and the box it came in closely and it's TOO obvious that this is a bootleg. For anyone who doesn't mind bootlegs, I recommend this.

"Sorry to say that this product did not meet ""My"" expectation! I saw the scale and thought of ""Code 3"". There were decal blistering and tears, white film on the inside of the windshield (such as from super glue vapor) and finger prints.

The packaging was good but diecast models being as they are! I did not make contact with Seller for it is not worth the effort vs cost. So in simple terms, a lower quality product and nothing to do with the seller. So for you modelers whom like fire trucks this might be a good buy for the seller's ad claims if you buy several at one time the shipping drops and the price becomes very reasonable, but that's only through the seller and not Amazon prime.

"Kids always want these but they are so fragile.  My son played with it a few times before breaking it.  I assumed that it wouldn't last long for his age, so I purchased this cheaper one.  It is hard to control though, it hits the ceiling inside.  It is for inside use, but unless you have really high ceilings it doesn't leave you much room to fly.
And then taking it outside you have issues with trees, wind and rooftops.  You take your chances.",3.0
"This thing really only hovers and holds position well. Forward/backward is terribly slow and inefficient - it goes forward and back by tilting (achieved by the tail blades). But the copter would constantly try to offset that tilt (because of gyro balancing), so you tilt, it goes forward for a bit. Then you release the forward, and it would tilt back and fly right back.

This thing does not fly in any wind.

This thing has to take off on a perfectly even surface. (If you try to take off a quad on a severely uneven surface, the sides that are lower would spin stronger until a perfect balance is achieved then it takes off. With this quad, it would just fly off center meaning flying sideways instead of straight up)

Cannot fly outdoors. When I saw those Cheerson and Eachine and Wltoys mini quads for under $20 that can fly amazing outdoors against wind and with a good distance, I thought this heli would as well. Not the case. Short range, extremely prone to disconnect. Slightest wind pushes it away.

So, this heli is only good for flying in doors, at very close distance to the transmitter (like, in one room), and can really only hover up and down, and yaw left to right. Not the most fun.

Battery even though can last 6+ minutes, feels somehow shorter than my Hubsan X4 that flies for 5 minutes. Because the Hubsan could run 100 circles around a room before battery dies out, where the S107 would barely make one lap.",3.0
"Problems and Issues please read before purchase. Otherwise seems to be a good charger!

The unit is dead and does not charge 2C or 3C LiPo Batteries. Errors out all the time. As I mentioned in the e-mail I sent to the sellers (will see how they respond and update here) I currently use three different LiPo batteries and use three different chargers that came with the RC equipment I purchased. All the batteries are good and all the chargers charge and balance the batteries properly. No matter what I do when the unit does a Batter Check it reports Connection Break and does nothing.

I have disconnected an reconnected the Break Out box for the LiPo batteries, tried AC and DC, different batteries have different voltages and charge rates but no matter what I get Connection Break errors. Yes I have read the manual (very bad English) several times and the error section does not tell you to do or try anything on Connection Break errors.

Nothing worse than getting a new D.O.A. Toy!!

I fired a letter (e-mail) off to the sellers asking what I should do now. Will update as thing progress. We'll see what happens.

Update 1 Star to 3 Star:  I received a phone call the next day and was told the output on the batteries need to be connected. This was NOT documented and actually only documented for Balance Charging but it is ALWAYS required. So now it works great for most of my batteries but not all my batteries as was the intent. The small tiny LiPo batteries 180mah 200mah for small computers, planes and boast use the Input connector as the Output connecter so there is no way to connect these.

The issue was with remote as the left stick controlling altitude was very loose and lacked any precision controlled. The issue was resolved though some basic repair and worked wonderfully afterwards.

It has been a lot higher before with no issues. The drone battery was fresh off the charger. It just went up, banked left and kept going. Perhaps a blade flew off like others have mentioned.

"Got this for my husband because he begged me and he has flown it once, maybe twice in 6 months.  This is definitely NOT a good toy if you have small kids in the house or animals that might attack it.  It takes a long time to charge and the battery does not last long.  I can't remember exactly what interferes with it but several times the helicopter stopped responding when other items were on in the house.  I think a few of the kids' toys were the culprit as well as a television remote.

On the positive side, it is not a very expensive gift and even with its downfalls would get you at least a hug from the recipient.  It is very entertaining to watch someone trying to learn how to fly it.  Make sure there are no breakable things around and you could get at least a few laughs out of the experience!",3.0
Overall it was easy to fly. Fast to charge and fun to play with. We have 4. One however burned out and smoke came out of it and well we don't have it any more. But for 20bucks. You can not beat the price! Careful though wind and it do not work well. Great for indoors! So I would buy kids 2 of them each!,3.0

"Super duper fun!  I bought this for my 9 year old son, and the whole family (husband especially) has enjoyed playing with it.

PROS:  Fun to fly.  Once you get the hang of the steering, you can do all sorts of neat tricks.  It's mesmerizing and exciting to watch. The metal body is more sturdy that its plastic counterparts.  Definitely the best for its price.

CONS:  Rotor blades break very easily.  Buy an extra set of blades at the same time so you have them on hand.  The blades on ours started hitting each other, so we ordered new parts and took the thing apart, but it doesn't come with instructions on how to put it back together!  I couldn't find anything helpful on their website, and the youtube videos were often unclear.  After a LOT of trial and error, I think we got it.  But it still doesn't seem to fly as high or for as long.  If you disassemble yours, take pictures at every step, and hey, post them on the world wide web for the benefit of all mankind!

Also, it flies for 5-8 minutes, but takes 40 minutes to charge.  Attention Syma: wouldn't it be great to have a removable battery, so you could buy several of them, switch them out quickly, and keep on flying!?!  I'm really on to something there.",3.0
"After only a month of use the battery would no longer carry a charge.  When it was working it only did so for about 20 minutes at a time.  We had to purchase a new battery and then use a saudering iron to replace it in the helicopter.  However, the copter has survived several crashes.  Very  susceptible to very light breezes, such as that created by younger children waving their arms.",3.0
"And it does! The flash lights and fluid controls really entertains my cat. I'm was hoping my cat would jump and attack this thing, but he hasn't yet.

This thing is pretty cool.

Pros: 1. It's small (Basically fit in the palm of my hand).
  2. Fairly easy to control
  3. Charges fairly fast ( 40min)

Cons. 1. Low Fly time ( around 10-15 min of fly time)
  2. The Range from Control is about 30ft
  3. My dog hate it

All the being said, I am happy with this product. It's going to be fun to have my friends over and fly/ram this thing in to their face. (It won't hurt, this thing is too light. This thing has no power behind it).

Long delivery time. This bad boy is from China.

I bought this truck for my son and its nice.  It comes fully functional with everything you need and it's 4 wheel drive.  Not bad for the money.  However it is not a super durable vehicle.  The front bumper fails quickly (snaps off frame) leaving the front steering exposed to collisions.  Then everything else breaks due to no protection.  Getting parts was a huge challenge at first - but after some research I found out this truck is also a Redcat model.  This company is much easier to track down to get parts.  I'm upgrading most everything to metal.  Kind of a laugh since I could have just started out buying the car in pieces and putting it together.  I've already had to replace the cheap remote that came with mine.  Next it'll be the motor and ESC upgrade.  I may get a motor with a lower turn count (like a T20 or T15) to speed it up a bit.,3.0
Battery no good!!!!!!!,3.0
"Not very good, everything is cheap, the shock and the shock tower have bent in the first 3 weeks since pitches, real disappointed.",3.0
Love this but very flimsy and piece broke 1st day but still usable,3.0
The cage should be more durable for the performance of this toy.  It can do many cool things; however the cage can not hold up to the motivation.  It should be more durable.,3.0
"Worked great for awhile but product was relatively cheap and did not hold up to hours of play.  You get what you pay for, I guess",3.0

"Pros:
Seems to hold up with a few indoor crashes as you get used to the controller.
Bubbles and colored strobe lights are great fun!

Con:
Very sensitive controls
Battery charges do not last that long",3.0
"This helicopter is easy to fly even for first timers like me.  The charge would last for about 15 -20 minutes which is pretty good for something this size.

My problem came about a month and a half after I got it.  The gear for the lower blade came out of alignment so it would not fly.  I was able to get it back in but with a week it came out again and would not go back in this time.",3.0
"If not play with bubble just only helicopter, just for fun , reliable and not expensive. I recommand S107S. I got 16 cops and different model.",3.0
"It works great and has awesome power!! It will burn out on any smooth surface, but it has a charging problem, Im not sure if its the battery or the charger but it was awesome while it lasted!",3.0
"This Quadopter is a lot of fun, but after it gets ""warm"" it becomes very hard to control.  The fine adjustments on the controller don't seem to make much difference and the manual is not very helpful.  For the money its ok.",3.0
"This is an 'ok' helicopter. My main beef is that it doesn't have an on/off switch on the actual helicopter. You have to disconnect the battery every time and recharge. It's hard to pull the connectors apart and you feel like you're going to break the thing every time you charge. The seem to have very specific rules about how long you can charge the battery too which is annoying to keep track of. It flys for about 15 minutes max per charge and is somewhat difficult for an amature to adjust the trim.

Overall it's fun though once you get the hand of it and it does come with an extra battery for double the flying fun once you get it charged.",3.0
Good toy,3.0
"pretty fun, but already broke the front shock tower twice (in two weeks). Parts are not readily available. Still it's a fun car, but in retrospect I would pony up the add'l 100 bucks for the 2wd Traxxas slash.",3.0
"Man i loved it.  It hovers like a dream.  I haven't had the chance to go take it out and do 3d yet (attempt 3d) but i will soon.  I hovered it in my very small living room with no problems.  The devo 7e is actually nice as well, though im sure the directions are poor.  Right out of box, with no trimming, and no adjusting of any kind, this bird hived so smoothly and so still that i wondered, for a moment, if it was better than the Blade Nano Cpx.  We shall see...

Update..... Get the nano cpx over this heli if you plan on doing anything besides normal flight. If you crash, you will strip servos...nearly every time. Ive crashed my nano 50 times and have never bought a new servo...never. I changed my stars from 5 to 3. It does hover VERY smoothly and flies scale flight like a dream. But 3D...meh.  Stripping servos is the MAIN problem.",3.0
"The car has magnificent traction and crawling capabilities, but it is too slow for my likes.  I ended up returning the car.",3.0
"The vehicle seemed well built, but was very slow, too slow.",3.0
"I bought two, beginner user. I set up a pretty decent course of pallets, planks, hills. It was a tough course, my son's worked fine. Mine, I stripped out three front end differentials gears., So I glued the knuckle axel, then I broke two. I used mine a lot more. These are great for novice use, just not for extreme crawler use. too much torque will strip the gear box. Also, I broke my servo on day two. LIke I said, I had a decent course and hard obstacles.
I am not sure who even writes these reviews. It's a good crawler but if u really want to crawl the front end will strip. Just take it easy.",3.0
entry level but great for the price and can up grade with axial parts,3.0
Wheel base too narrow for how tall the truck is time over too much. Also way to much torque twist.,3.0
Plastic parts that's the only thing negative I can say so far . Castor broke a few trips out .,3.0
"Met my expectations, after reading the reviews on line I would agree that it does need the stronger shocks and tires with more grip. The only real issue is the servo going out after the first day of use. Based on the reviews I read this part is normally okay. I have contacted the seller to see what I need to do to address this issue. I will repost if I get the issue addressed.",3.0
"I returned mine so I could move up to a better truck. The Maxstone has great potential, and crazy powerful right out of the box. But low end components make it unreliable - especially the front diff and the transmitter",3.0
"this crawler is well priced but the price is simply too good to be true. the gear differentials sound like they are packed with sand when this thing drives. the center driveshafts are held on with set screws that strip if you put any kind of pressure on them. the main problem with the driveshafts being held on with set screws though is that the driveshafts come off if you put too much pressure on them. the plastic is also very brittle on this truck, the weak stock servo was able to snap the servo horn right in half while turning on flat cement this truck is somewhat capable, but is quite skinny so that defiantly holds it back. the aluminum on this truck is very low quality and is hollowed out a lot. my axial ridgecrest is so much better than this in every way and i would really recommend it over this.",3.0
"2013:
the servo worked three or four times, after that it overheated for no reason so it seems it had some electronic short circuit. I contacted the seller and they sent me another servo with no charge. The battery runs for almost 25 minutes but charge time is 7 hours so I bought a tenergy charger it charges a 3800mah battery in a couple of hours and it should give me 50 minutes of fun.

the front dog bone came unassembled but I had the tool to tighten it so no problem with that. If you want spare parts look for hsp which is practically the same as exceed.

2017 update: Here is the list of the upgrades I've done:
- servo savox 1256 on the front axle, and a generic one on the rear, so it runs 4 wheel steering (4ws), and a few extra parts for the rear steering. (best upgrade for this rc)
- ESC wp1060 from hobbywing (optional)
- 18003 aluminum caster mounts (front only, recommended for high torque servos)
- 18009 aluminum main gears (both, absolutely necessary))
- aluminum wheel hex (soon, recommended)
- removed bumpers for more clearance (optional)
- 18021 wheel weights (all wheels), helps traction even with cheap stock tires (recommended)

Here is the list of the parts broken:
- 18002 rear gear box (front only, probable related to high torque from servo)
- 18006 caster mounts (front only, got stuck between rocks, so the high torque from the servo broke one of the casters)
- 18009 main gears (it's cheap plastic)
- 18016 wheel hex (just one)
- 18025 front and rear bumpers (not used)
- 18090 motor (failed and was replaced by seller)
- stock servo (failed and was replaced by seller)
- 18029 ESC (blown away on a fog-of-war battle)",3.0

It had an oval sewn into it's head denoting where the horn should be, but there's nothing there. It also can't stand up on its own, but that could be to do the fact that it's top heavy and it's left legs seemed more stuffed than the right legs. Even so, I find it adorable and will keep it.",3.0

I thought it was really nice for a digital coloring book but I had to send it back because my niece didn't have a tablet yet to use it.,3.0
"My son was really looking forward to try this, but we encountered quite a few problems. The app needs work, it takes a couple of taps to get it to open and when you tap a selection it takes a few more taps to get it going. The lag on this app makes it difficult to accomplished what it's intended for. Once we got the QR scanner to work, it did so without a problem, but the page we scan got the chocolate chip cookie logo stuck in the middle of the app. We had to restarted the app for it to disappear and rescan the page we wanted again. The stylus tip inverted itself, which decrease the accuracy, this made it very difficult to color within the lines. When we have some form of handle and started coloring the app froze and my son got so frustrated he delete it the app and grab his crayons to color in the book. I like the concept, but the app has some problems that need to be address to make it a successful product.

*Please note that I was sent this product complementary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.",3.0
"I was really looking forward to this product for my son. It comes with a coloring book and a stylus that looks like a cute chunky crayon. My son was thrilled when he opened it. I told him that he could use the ""crayon"" with the free app that comes with it and he couldn't wait. I searched all over the app store only to finally discover that it was not compatible with his tablet, nor on my other tablet. I was able to get it on my phone though. I tried to use the QR scanner to scan the coloring book page onto my phone so that  he could color, but the QR scanner function would not work with the book whatsoever.
He did like playing with the app alone though. However,  I don't really like the idea of him playing games on my phone often, especially since I have a fear of him dropping it. He does use the coloring book like a normal coloring book and he uses the stylus pen with his other coloring games on his tablet. I'm happy that although he couldn't use the app on his tablet, at least he can still use the coloring book and stylus crayon in other ways.

Disclaimer: I received this magical coloring book plus stylus crayon, complimentary, in exchange for an honest review. All of the opinions expressed here are solely my own. No other compensation was received.",3.0
I have not been able to use this on my tablet without it force closing. But my kids did love the coloring book and they used the stylus for a bit on the website when it was working. I could not get it to take pictures on my phone either. Kept force closing. I have a Samsung galaxy 3 tablet and motorola moto phone.,3.0
"I was really excited about the idea behind this product. My son loves coloring and loves technology, so I was sure combining the two would be awesome. While I still really love the concept, I encountered quite a few problems while using this.

The coloring book by itself is pretty nice and I love that it is 100% recycled paper. I like that the stylus is crayon shaped, so it is easy for my son to hold and use. I did discover that the tip of the stylus flattens quite a bit when used, which decreases the accuracy of the stylus. While my son is too young to care about that, an older child who is picky about coloring inside the lines might have a few issues with the stylus.

There is a companion app you can use with the coloring book, and I had a few problems with that too. If I was just coloring the pages in the app, it worked fine. However, you are supposed to be able to start coloring in the book, scan the page, and then finish coloring in the app. I couldn't get that feature to work at all in the iPad version of the app. I got it to scan the page in the iPhone version, but then it would shrink the picture and turn it sideways, making it impossible to color.

The product website has a video that says there is also a Scan Lulu app that just does that job of scanning the colored page in, but as far as I can tell, that app doesn't actually exist.

Overall, I like the concept, but the execution has some problems. As it stand now, I can only give this product 3 stars. However, it could easily be a five star product if the issues are addressed.

I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.",3.0
"My son enjoyed playing on paintinglulu.com. Sadly we could not access the app for this coloring book because we use windows devices. I also tried it on a kindle that my mom brought with her while they were visiting us. This would have been a fabulous product if we had an iphone or androoid phone. If you have one of those devices you kid will love this!

"Very useful tool as a therapist to teach children CBT concepts. I was very disappointed, however, that there is the word 'DAMMIT' located on two sides of the box.  I sent an email to the only address I found on the instructions, and have not received a reply. As this game is approved for children as young as six, I find it very inappropriate language.

My problem with these toys is that you can't even get half of them to stay on the stand.

The paint job is horrible. They painted over all details.

Real miku: They made her skirt all the same color, when it's supposed to be black with turquoise  at the bottom. They even painted over the triangles on her shirt. And her leg stalkings are supposed to have turquoise in it too.

I don't have a problem with Kaito or Len but they are sloppily painted.

Haku looks fine but they need to take more time on painting.

Luka's hair looks white. her headband is all gold when it is supposed to be black and gold. The gold in her outfit looks green and they completely painted over details.

Akita Neru's tie has a black spot in it cause they failed to paint slowly enough for the details there. Her skirt is all yellow and you can tell they painted over details.

"when it comes to a nitro paying $135 shouldn't get you much. Upon visional inspection out of the box, I noticed the body didn't fit correctly. The right rear tire rubbed the body. I trimmed the body so it no longer rubbed. the tires dot not have foam in them, so ill be running to the hobby shop to buy tire foam and glue. The shocks are some what disappointing! I did a 4 inch drop, and it bottomed out. I installed the largest spring spacers, and dropped in 4 inches again. It bottomed out, but had a spring to it. I think ill also pick up some good shock oil from the hobby store. Tomorrow Ill fire it up, break it in, and up date my review in the evening. The price makes it easier to accept minor set backs. I am still very satisfied thus far!

 Day 2 broke the engine in! Drove through grass for a while, It bogged down quite a bit, but was fast still and fun. It seems a bit unstable at tight cornering, and loose terrain. The seventh tank in I went to the street to see what its made of. It is fast! The foamless tires actually were not as bad as I thought. The rear squats so bad that it makes steering difficult. I was cautions driving, but was aggressive. By the eighth and ninth tank I bent 2 drive shafts (rh front and lh rear at almost 90 degrees), and the lh front shock, and the rear shock mount. I was able to straighten the axles, the shock, and the shock mount to get me back in action. I dumped the shock oil and refilled with new 30 wt oil, which helped me with the squatting. At the end I noticed that my clutch bell is blue (burnt). I will inspect the clutch tomorrow, and probably replace with a better one.

In conclusion This is a low budget nitro buggy. Things are going to break, and modifications need to be preformed for normal driving. It is fairly rugged considering it didn't leave me broke down with an unrepairable break. I don't think this is for a beginner without mechanical capabilities. I do think this is a good nitro for someone to learn before they buy a good one. The price makes it expendable for practice.",3.0

I do not like Story Reader 3.  The books have a wire binder that does not fit the reader properly and some of the pages do not work.  It is very frustration.

"I gave this to my niece for her 3rd birthday. In the two months since, it has become her favorite book. She has experienced none of the problems that the My First version seems to have and her parents have asked me to get her more books for Xmas.

Problems with buying more books:

* when I buy the Sesame Street 3-pack, I'll be buying a second copy of Elmo's Colorful Adventure, which came with the Reader. (This might be a benefit for kids who are rough on their books.) Why couldn't one or the other include Elmo's Jamboree, which is only sold as a single title?

* many of them have odd groupings - Spongebob is not, nor has ever been, part of Nick Jr, has little to no educational value, and IMHO has no business being in with Dora the Explorer and Blue's Clues. Why not Diego or Kai-lan?

* According to the manufacturer's website there are 60+ books made for the Story Reader but very few seem to be available for purchase. PIKids does have a site through which you can buy them, except it can't retrieve its own XML data. >_< (In other words, the website doesn't work.)

On the plus side, the microphone is great fun for any little performer, even without the book. But one can find lots of toy mics for sale.

"I picked up this somewhat newly designed version at a thrift store recently. Battleship has long been a favorite game of mine but mine and my husband's enjoyment was spoiled quite a bit by the unnecessary new design. Why mess with a classic? They have replaced the very simple pegs with clumsy ill-fitting ones that fall out at the slightest bump. They have rounded the edges of the case, thereby eliminating the helpful score keeping holes at the top edge of the game that allows you and your opponent to keep track of who is ahead. I do not see the point of any of these 'updates'. Very annoying. If you can find an old version at a yard sale or on eBay I would recommend skipping this. My husband and I, both adults, had a difficult time with the new design. I can't imagine young children playing this without some frustration.",3.0
This particular version of the game is best used up to a table than on a lap because the pegs and ships poke through the bottom so if it gets bumped then they fall out.,3.0
great toy for 8 years old.  The battle over the sea make kids excited.  But I expect more logic training from the game and I didn't find much.,3.0
I had this item as a kid and thought my kids would enjoy it.  They do but not as much as I thought.  Good game for a rainy day.,3.0
"I don't know of anyone who *hasn't* played ""Battleship"" at some point in their life. I'm 36 now but I remember well the iconic Battleship commercials that would play on Saturday morning TV featuring two buck-toothed youths squinting deviously over the backs of their respective blue and red gameboards at each other and one stating ""You sunk my battleship!"" (it seemed odd he should sound so gleeful about it, considering he just lost a ship). We had the regular version and the Electronic Battleship which I used to play with my mom at the tender age of 6.

Battleship is one of those timeless games that has left an indelible mark on boardgamers everywhere. It doesn't rely on dice or cards, making it a nice break from games like ""Sorry"" or ""Monopoly"". What it does have are dozens of little red and white plastic pegs, 10 grey plastic ships of varying types and sizes, and two folding plastic gameboards. The premise is very simple. You place your fleet comprised of 5 ships (Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Destroyer, Submarine, and what I assume to be a PT Boat) onto a perforated plastic grid (each ship has pegs on the bottom which allow it to be placed on the board). The plastic grid is numbered in rows on the horizontal plane and lettered A, B, C, etc. on the vertical. On the up-folded section is an identical grid which is used to track shots one fires at the enemy fleet. The game begins with one player announcing coordinates (B-4, D-8, etc) in an attempt to narrow down where their opponents vessels may be. The defending player reports ""Hit"" if the opponents scores one, and ""Miss"" if they hit empty ocean. If you land a hit on an opponent's ship you use a red peg to mark the location on your map, and white if you miss. In this way you can track out where the opponents ships out using deduction.

The dynamic is simple, fast-paced, and fun, and perhaps that what makes the game as popular as it is. This is a game that is perfect for kids 12 and under, and after a few games you'll start to see a few, budding Admiral ""Bull"" Halsey's growing on the vine. As a teaching tool, if you're looking for that kind of thing in a kid's game, ""Battleship"" somewhat limited. There's no doubt that it will develop your little tyke's deduction centers in the brain. It's also a pretty good introduction into the world of coordinates and how to use them.

I would say that each individual red or white peg costs about $10.00, or did at the time that I was a child. How did I arrive at this value? That was the cost of the replacement belt for my Mom's vacuum cleaner, which sucked up dozens of my little plastic artillery shells, along with my old GI Joe rifles and clear plastic legos (my Mom's bane). This is not helped by the fact that all the pegs come in one clear baggie, which makes sorting something of a chore. The gameboards themselves are compartmentalized so you can store the pegs in it once you've sorted them.

The wife and I have begun to collect boardgames like ""Battleship"" in preparation for the children we plan on having someday. We played a couple of matches and found that the game is sorely lacking in the same ""fun factor"" it gave us as children, so if you're looking for some deep, realistic nautical wargame for adults, look elsewhere. For this reason I wanted to give the game an overall score of 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon doesn't allow that I'll have to give it 3 even.

This game will most certainly provide a staple of your average family game night and will provide a lot of fun time with the kids.",3.0
"Based on nostalgia for my own childhood, we got this for our soon-to-be 6 year-old for Christmas.  I wasn't sure if my memory wasn't serving me properly or not, but other reviews here seem to confirm what I thought: the current version is very flimsy and cheaply-made compared to the older versions from years ago.  The pegs easily fall out of their holes. The letters and numbers are hard to see as they are the same color as the board. That said, my son really enjoyed his first time playing, although he needed help from an adult navigating the grid.  I do believe if the letters and numbers had better visibility he would grasp this sooner.
I recommend finding an older version of this game on eBay or somewhere.",3.0
"Okay, I used to love this game.  Played it when I was a kid, when we had to draw a new game out on paper each time we played.  It was instant nostalgia on plastic game boards, and lots of memories from many many moons ago.  And, guess what ~ I still love it.  No one else does, or at least the ones who play with me.  I have no mercy.

The game doesn't look real sturdy, but will outlast me, probably.  I had a bit of a problem getting the play pieces mounted on the play board, but with a little determination, and some surgical trimming with my pocket knife, we got a game underway.  The game didn't last long as I sunk my opponents ships one after the other.  Nothing like a sore loser in a war game.  They want revenge!!

One thing in particular that I didn't like: The game has red pegs and white pegs to denote hits and misses on the enemy's ships.  All of these pegs come packed in a SINGLE CELLOPHANE BAG.  What a pain, having to separate those little things before you can fire your first shot.  Come on, guys (whoever makes this thing), use two cellophane bags.  I promise, you won't go broke, and you'll do wonders for your image (and my language).

It's a fun game, but apparently frustrating for those who lose.  I don't get the feeling I'll be playing this much, but it'll still make a nice gift - and I'll include two bags of separated colored pegs!",3.0
"I have to agree with several prior comments concerning the marking pins, they are a poor fit and a simple bump can cause the pins to jump off the board - can we expect a seven year old or even an adult to not bump the board ocasionally?  Also, I had to file down the ships pins so they would fit into the boards holes - I don't recall having these problems when I was a kid.  Too often the game companies rely on history to sell a game, then deliver an inferior produt.",3.0
"I don't like this. It's just finding other people's ships. I mean, it's just like the game of memory!!! That game stinks. I don't like this. (Sorry if you like this game a lot)",3.0
"I have been wanting this game for a long time.  I like the idea but my only problem is the game responses.  It is hard to understand when a ship has been hit.  You only can tell if it takes longer or says more words.  What they say I have no idea but it isn't like You made a hit, or not.  You can only play this game when no one else is speaking in the room.",3.0
"I remember playing this as a kid and it was fun then, but I don't think all in all it's got the classic pure gaming kind of thing going for it.
Too much of it is blind luck, unless you consider the ability to outguess your opponents ability to place his ships in some confusing fashion a skill.  Not at all like Risk or Stratego, this isn't really a battle game at all, it's just a random guessing game.
Still, it has some enjoyment factor with the younger set and it's a good child/adult game in that it doesn't take much skill to play and the luck factor can give a kid the victory.
There is some logic in how you place your ships and some logic in how to attack, so I do give the game an average rating, it can be fun to play.",3.0
"Battleship is  a really fun game if you think outside the box and hide your battleship on the carpet instead of on the board. However, this strategy carries a significant risk of physical violence from fellow game players(such as siblings) when they discover your ruse.",3.0
"Mancala is a great game to play anywhere, so I was excited to find a travel mancala set to take to the beach. The board itself is well built, solid with a good hinge spring to keep it shut.
My main complaint with the set was the stones, which are painted micro-pebbles of varying sizes. Although the irregular shapes contribute to the faux-authenticity of the game, they are extremely hard to handle, pick out of the small board holes, and distribute without dropping into the wrong hole. There is also a strong possibility of having your carefully held fingerful of stones fall away completely, scattering across the floor and initiating a completely new kind of game!
My second problem with the set is the instructions. There are several variations on Mancala, and this one is obscure and hard to understand. No other options are presented for the players to use.
Skip this one, set aside a little extra room, and take a full sized board with real stones.",3.0
A bit flimsy. Plastic handle could be issue quickly,3.0
The closure isn't easy for my kids to use. Its a cute box and we keep lego in it for in the car. But the clip to close it comes open and bends easily. Not overly impressed with that but it is overall a cute tin.,3.0
So far it works but looks cheaply made.,3.0
"Received the tool set today and was checking it out before wrapping it up for my daughters birthday.  Like the previous reviewer, my 4 year old daughter is also a huge Handy Manny fan and is constantly digging through my toolbox.

The tools included in the play set are sturdy and nicely made (with the exception of the level).  However, the case which holds the tools will be lucky to last a week.  Upon initial inspection, the paper thin plastic that holds the tools in place was already detached from the outer casing and a few spots will be ripped open soon.

Three stars overall because my daughter will love playing with the tools.",3.0

However the pop-rivets on the latch broke the first week he had it.

tin is flimsy and latch doesn't meet up have to push it side ways to get it to meet up so it will close. Thought it would be more stout like the old lunch boxes. But it is cute use it for crayons and markers.,3.0

"were expecting . 1st off let me say this , it's made in China . It's smaller than your average lunch box and has no lil' drink bottle inside  either . Also the latch is plastic and although it's holding i've got my doubts as to it's longevity for my grandson . The box itself is however tin and although i like that it's metal , it's unbelievable thing metal and poorly hinged with simple folded over tangs or flaps as i'd call em that link it to the other and that's for sure not all that secure . As for the pro's or positives to this lil' box , it's Curious George and all kids love or loved his cute lil' monkey shennanigans at some point and time . The artwork is pretty well done and seemingly durable thus far . The price of course was a plus and sadly i'm realizing that we've got what we've paid for ...",3.0

I ordered this game for my grandson. It arrived in a timely manner. The cards were not as sturdy and of the same quality as the original game that my children had. I guess that's the fault of the toy manufacturer and not the supplier. So hopefully this set will last for a while.,3.0
"I bought this because I played it as a kid with my cousins and I remembered it being a very fun game....The only problem was the instructions were terrible. I didn't remember how to play and me and my sister spent about half an hour trying to figure it out.

"bought this for my son to have at his house to play..I also have the Deluxe Edition and thought it was the same one.
The tray is a cheap looking piece of plastic. It does serve it's purpose, but not made as nice as the one in my set.

"I'll begin my review by saying that I love Yahtzee. I never grow tired of it and I enjoy the excitement of trying to roll a good hand. It's fun and addictive. But I have several issues with this current Deluxe version.

First of all, the physical components of the Deluxe version of this game are a big disappointment. They no longer resemble the picture on the Amazon screen. For example, the dice are a hideous shade of dark pink, not white, red or cream colored. When I first took them out of the box and looked at them, the first thought I had was something along the lines of, ""What in the world...."" I continued to examine them and couldn't really believe what I was seeing. The dice were flat-out ugly. The indentations on the dice were a weird shade of red, which makes them difficult to ""read"" on a dark-pink background. The second disappointment was the rolling tray. It doesn't look like the picture on the screen. It's a very thin, very flexible gauge of plastic, somewhat paperlike, completely covered in a cheap black felt. It's so light and flimsy, that when you roll the dice in it, the entire rolling tray sometimes moves across the table. The two black scoring pencils would have been a nice touch had they both been embossed with the word ""Yahtzee"" on them like we see in some of the photos. But these were just plain black pencils. The dice cup has a padded felt liner formed inside of it, but the liner seems to be coming detached at two points near the lip of the cup because the glue is breaking down. Probably the best aspects of this game are the directions, which are clear and well-written, and the enclosed scoring pads.

The Deluxe version just seems to be very poorly made with cheap components. I did NOT have high expectations for this game, and I didn't expect it to be of the quality of Yahtzee games of 25 years ago. But I am still disappointed. At $16.99, it just isn't worth it. Next time I'll go with the regular version at $7.99 and use the top of a shoebox as a rolling tray. It worked great when we were kids and it works great now.",3.0
"I have always enjoyed playing Yahtzee and wanted to get a nice version of the game.  I decided on the Deluxe version because I liked the idea of having a tray to use to roll the dice in and from the picture it looked like it would be a good quality product.  Boy was I wrong!  The game is of course the classic game, so I won't knock the game itself.  But the tray that this comes with is very flimsy.  I had expected it to be a solid plastic tray but it is not.  The rest of the game is fine, but because I had paid twice as much for this deluxe version, I thought I would be getting a better quality product than I did.",3.0
"I did receive this in a timely manner, but I thought I was getting a card tray with the card game. The original versions which I had bought many of years ago always had a card tray included. I was a little disappointed. The game itself is lots of fun and timeless.",3.0
It's advanced for 3yo. Long term I'm sure we'll put it to better use but if you want a cash register for play grocery shopping I would stick with FP. Change is lightweight and spills easy since the drawer opens quick and with force. Paper money is suited for older hands that won't crumple it.,3.0
"The quality is okay. I don't know how long it would hold up with kids under 12yo.... The plastic top is the only solid thing... then 4 plastic pins hold the colored cardboard underneath the plastic top. The popper is also probably not going to holdup for kids for too long. I remember my original game being somewhat larger and the plastic part held on a sturdy platform. The game is the same setup (generally) though I probably could have found the same-ish for less.
I don't expect it to last forever and didn't buy it for small kids, so I'm happy.
Although between this and UNO, which I also recently purchased, I think my family is too competitive for playing games together.",3.0
Cheap version... A colored cardboard at the bottom does not come attach to the game,3.0
Had a great time teaching this game to our grandsons who are 3 and 6 yrs old. But disappointed with the need to assemble the bottom by using a paper on the underside that was included and then attaching 4 small rubber discs to hold it in place. A bit cheaper than I remember when we had one when we were young.,3.0
Plastic bubble in the middle was cracked upon arrival.,3.0
"The drawer opens with a lot of force and all the coins come out. Otherwise, it' a sturdy play register.",3.0
It's a shame how cheaply these games are made now. I expect the dice popper to crack before it's a year old as well as the game board. The game board is too light weight and the thin plastic pegs easily fall out of the spaces.,3.0

A really frustrating feature. Also poor is that the calculator screen is not backlit. It has the old school black numbers on green/gray background typical of solar calculators, and at the angle of the screen, it is barely possible to read at times. This would be a much more powerful ""learning resource"" with illuminated numbers.",3.0

I called customer service, and they sent me out a replacement very promptly which I was happy about.  The replacement had the pieces, however, the number 1 on the die was red, while the rest of the numbers was black.  I could have called back for another replacement, but at this point, I just really wanted to play the game, so I just lived with it.",3.0

"It is a great idea. Mostly very well executed. However, the biggest problem is indeed a real problem. Unless I have a lamp that can sit in front of the register the solar panel does not get enough light to power the calculator. Not even with floor to ceiling windows in a bright room does this work. But if you put a lamp in front the register might tip over the lamp. The drawer does open forcefully as other reviewers have noted, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Not having a working calculator is problematic. However, my daughter loves it.",3.0
it's ok and it is quite challenging. but I don't like the flimsy plastic cars - it is too light and doesn't stay put on their spot.,3.0
"Not happy with this version, but I got on sale for about $6. So I will keep it.",3.0
"Good product, nothing special tho. You have to catch the door or when they open all the money will fly out of them, it has 3 spaces for paper bills but it come with 4 different type. Overall build decent but again nothing special",3.0
"I WOULD love it, but for two things. I bought it to help teach my kids about money, thinking the separate spots for all the cash would help them out (as opposed to our old play register, that just had one big drawer to mish-mash all the money together).
Well it does have separate spots for everything, except for the $20 bills. Oh, I get it, they wouldn't fit. But I would easily sacrifice the realistic size of the money for another compartment for the $20's! I mean, really, what exactly is the draw in realistically sized play money (aside from coins) anyway?
The second issue is that when you push the button to open it, the thing comes SLAMMING open, which almost always causes the coins to jump around and out of the register or into the other compartments, defeating the purpose of having separate compartments.

Other than that, I love the beep when you put the ""card"" into the ""card reader"". I love the beep for each of the buttons, and it makes a satisfying ""CHING!"" when you open the drawer. Oh, and I love that it has a button to open the drawer. Our last register was just a normal drawer you pulled out. Not at all satisfying!

I replaced the silly pad of paper (which wouldn't stay in place, obviously) with a pad of sticky notes so it would stop falling off. Yeah, their ""receipts"" are sticky, but they don't care. They actually like it.",3.0

Introduced my kids to an old favorite game of mine as a kid. We love this game. But the quality of the material used to make it is poor.,3.0
"""Mindtrap"" is a simple game where players ask each other lateral thinking puzzles. At its best, the game is a blast to play, with tantalizing puzzles that force players to ask multiple questions to get to the answer, and even then the answer continues to fascinate. For example: ""The maker doesn't want it, the buyer doesn't use it, and the user doesn't see it. What is it?"" The solution to this puzzle is rather subtle and very difficult to get without a great deal of thinking, but it makes a lot of sense and you won't feel duped if you don't get it.
Too often, however, the puzzles stoop to the same level as corny kids' jokes in which the answer depends entirely on how the puzzle is worded. For example--and I am NOT making this up--one of the puzzles said: ""Why can't you take a picture of a man with a wooden leg in Okmulgee, Oklahoma?""...and the answer was, ""Because you need to use a camera.""
Other times, the puzzles have painfully obvious answers that just stare at you in the face while your brain hop-skips over them. Often the answers to these puzzles are ""the water was frozen"", ""it was daylight outside"", or ""the container was empty"". These are not as insipid as the aforementioned puns, but they are hardly satisfying.
Then there are the really hard puzzles in which you think and think and think--only to find an absurd answer that you'd never get in a thousand years. For example: ""You're alone in a room where the walls, ceiling and floor are made of solid concrete. There's a small hole in the ground with a ping-pong ball securely lodged into it. You only have with you a wooden ruler, a string, a pocket mirror, and a magnet. How would you get the ping-pong ball out?""...And the answer is, ""The only way to get the ball out is to urinate into the hole, making the ball float.""
Players are bound to have some great moments with ""Mindtrap"" when it comes to the really good questions. These are also the times when they'll use their best critical thinking, and therefore they are the game's best educational moments as well. But, as you can see, the game isn't always fun and challenging, and there are many times where it doesn't demand its players to think critically. This is my reason for the 3-star educational and fun ratings. Also, the game contains nothing more than 500 question cards and a paper board map, which are hardly worth the game's price.
My advice? Just buy any book of lateral thinking puzzles instead. You'll get lots of insightful puzzles with realistic answers at a fraction of the price.
(Incidentally, the answer to the ""maker, buyer, user"" question is ""A coffin"".)",3.0
"grabbing questions pretty liberally from the small paperbacks of 'lateral thinking puzzles' this box of goodies puts a question and answer on each card and provides a roll of the die (marked with 1-3 dots) to move along a simple path to achieve victory.
I've played it a number of times now and feel it's not difficult enough to be a challenge.  I think there's only been one puzzle that has had me beat and that goes for my partner as well.
If you enjoy these kinds of puzzles then this is OK - I bought it on special as I don't think it had sold too well.  At full price I'd have keenly felt the price whenever I played.",3.0
"I love the game. I played it as a child so many years ago. Now I've taught my 8-year-old and she loves it. The plastic pieces and box it comes in though are cheap crap. I ended up dumping all the pieces into small zipper-seal baggies because the onboard storage solution just sucks. It doesn't contain anything properly and the pieces are all falling out loosely into the box. Which, by the way, has a plastic window in it. So you can't really stack this with the rest of your games. But hey, if you need Mastermind to scratch that itch, this is what you get. A necessary evil, one could say.",3.0

"I love this game - it brings back a lot of memories playing at my grandparents' house in the 80s, and I was happy to find it here.  I purchased this, and must say, I was a little disappointed.  My main issue is that the storage compartment doesn't close when all the pegs are in there.  I'm having to store the pegs separately in a ziploc bag.  Also, during game play, the pegs do seem to fall from the holes pretty easily, if they are accidently knocked.  However, that aside, the gameplay is awesome and it's been fun getting reacquainted with this blast from the past!  My young family members really enjoy playing as well.",3.0
Love the game. Not the quality of the old version. All the pieces go everywhere and the flap to hide your code is weird!,3.0
"I expected higher quality for this toy as I had one when I was young and now I bought it for my son. The pins do not fit firmly and the board itself is platic with paper top that can be teared apart. The one I had in 1979 was stiff, little larger, the board top is factory colored with no papers to put.

But after all it is the same toy that I had during my old years and I mean to enhance it a bit by having the pins fit firmly and the board top to be painted in the background below the transparent  face. Thank you for your understanding and care",3.0
Disappointing that the cardboard bottom isn't up to par as the old sturdy version. The bubble is hard to pop for little children (watched them play it & they had to use their body weight while pressing down with both hands).

The pieces are not as high of quality and they took out black and white and have pink and purple instead. The holding tray to put the pegs was a nice idea, but it's not big enough for all the pegs and if you put the big pegs and the little pegs in, you have to sort them each and every time you want to play the game. Overall I'm disappointed that the quality isn't nearly as good. If I could get new pegs for the old board I would.",3.0
Still a great game but this board isn't as nice as the one from when we were kids,3.0
You can put your figure on a field only if you have six on a dice. It can take 10-15 minutes which is really annoying.,3.0
"(This review is written from the perspective of someone familiar with playing the original version from the 70s/80s.)
I was sooooo excited to rediscover this game from my childhood and share it with my 5 year old. We LOVE the fun new colors, and what really got me EXCITED was the prospect of having #1) a 'cover' for the code that couldn't accidentally get kicked off the board, essentially ruining the game by letting the guesser see the code (and having someone dissolve into tears!) and #2) the compartment that you can put all the pegs in was an AMAZING feature to me, making the game, I guessed, easily transportable - and just super convenient to have everything stored together.

My only problem is not with the actual game - it's the same old concept and we love it (my five year old loves to make the code and is very good at giving me accurate clues most of the time - he's not yet adept at figuring out the strategy behind being an effective code guesser, though.). The problems are with the very 2 reasons I listed above that made me so excited for this new version. #1) the code cover I thought would be attached is not, and although it probably won't come off with a mild jostle, it might, and it's pretty hard to fit in to the place it's supposed to be to cover the code. #2) The compartment to store the pegs in almost drove me to harm someone or myself. It WILL NOT CLOSE without a serious wrangling of pushing the pegs away from the sides where it slides into the compartment and closes. I realize this might not seem like a big deal but I assure you, after spending 10 minutes trying to close the damn thing you'll understand - and live for the rest if your life like I will wondering how this ever could have been approved by whoever at this game company was responsible for designing it.",3.0
"The only reason I gave three stars is because the game itself is brilliant. Just as advertised, it is easy to learn and play but hard to win; however, the quality of this product is sub-par at best. The holes for the pins are not drilled to the correct size, the compartment for storing the pins is not large enough, and (while I have not used them all) lacks sufficient pins. The price is nothing expensive, but for something that costs probably less than $1 to mass produce, the quality could be much better. I wouldn't discourage buying this product, but know what you are getting.",3.0
Kids love it,3.0
"Clearly made as cheaply as possible.  The pegs fit, but aren't always perfect.  Overall, you're much better served to find an older version, of if you know anyone that has a wood shop, they could make you one much nicer.",3.0
I thought that I was going to be getting  a new  game but when I received  it the box was all crushed and the bubble in the middle is cracked. I was going to give this as a Christmas present but after seeing the condition of it I think that I may not.,3.0
"This is a cool game to play.  Beef up the board/case and it's a five star.  Like many things these days, it's made as cheap as consumers will tolerate.",3.0
The game is a lot of fun and great to play.  It's base is thinner cardboard than a pizza box.,3.0
The tray that holds the pieces isn't big enough. I had to store them in a separate container. Also the piece the blocks the masterminds puzzle is flimsy and didn't stay on well.,3.0
"Our children have enjoyed the game itself, but this is a poorly designed version.  First of all I should've noticed before I purchased, that the pegs are not the classic colors, but the board design itself is not well thought out. The way the storage compartment hinges leaves a gap for the score pegs and playing pegs to get mixed into each others storage area.  Plus the spot where you put your pattern to be guessed is difficult to put pieces in and out of and the cover comes off fairly easily.",3.0
"it works. all the parts are there and the popper pops. but this is made as cheap as possible. the colorful bottom to the game is a piece of paper that is only affixed by pushing the paper into four holes. i can see this not lasting long. but, it is the game we wanted. again, i remember it a little more sturdy than this.",3.0
I love this game as an adult and my kids like it as we'll. I'm just surprised it hasn't been updated from the flimsy and cheap version I've known since childhood. Still a classic,3.0
"The body is clear plastic, seems flimsy but it's durable enough.  The base background is just colored cardboard you need to slip in to assemble.  It will suffice, although I was expecting a better quality, as they made in the past.  The value is inferior for the cost.",3.0
"I grew up playing this game and I liked it as a kid. Thought we would get it too for our kids. The board and pieces are much cheaper quality than before. I guess you expect that to a degree, but it was still very disappointing. It's not like the game was made of super high quality parts before, but they still found a way to make them cheaper apparently. Overall, it works fine and kids like it, but I would've liked to see it made better.",3.0
"I love, love this game! But the peg holder on the side of the game board is not functional. It doesn't stay closed and isn't large enough to fit all the pegs! I prefer the vintage style of the game board, it has better colors and it's less bulky than this one.",3.0
"Great game, but cheaply made. There are a thousand little pegs that don't all fit in the compartment so it's practically useless.",3.0
The pieces are hard to fit in. The container does not close properly. We have this game in the travel version and wanted a larger version so that the pieces can be manipulated better. But to our dismay they aren't any easier to handle.,3.0
"This is the same game of Trouble I remember playing as a kid.  It's great for my daughter because it helps her with counting skills and basic game-playing such as dice-rolling, sportsmanship, following the rules, and strategy.  One thing I noticed, though, is that the game board is essentially a piece of paper covered by a plastic top.  The paper is clipped to the underneath of the plastic.  This doesn't seem nearly as durable as the Trouble of my youth.  Hopefully it will hold up through my daughters' childhood.",3.0
ok,3.0
Was a gift no comment here,3.0
"If you are going to purchase this toy please be aware that it is not really washable.  I clean all toys before I give them to my daughter as they invariably end up in her mouth.  When I tried to wash this rattle (with a soapy washcloth) the insides immediately became waterlogged and there is then no way to dry the toy other than to shake it as much as possible (messy) then leave it in the sun to dry (takes ages and leaves water marks).
In terms of play value, my daughter seems to like the toy but does keep smacking herself in the head with it!",3.0
"The game is the same as I remember from my youth... but the quality of the board has certainly suffered. I'm surprised at how flimsy the game board is. Sure, it's heavy plastic on top, but the ""color"" cardboard underneath is held on only by 4 rubber ""feet."" I can see already that this contemporary TROUBLE game board will not outlast the way my 4 year old will play with it.",3.0
"I remember liking ""Trouble"" when I was a kid, now that I'm an adult, it is really boring.  I played this with my kids recently, and the game started out ""fun"", but eventually started to drag on.  There isn't much strategy needed, and doesn't require much thought to play.  Pop bubble, move out a piece if you can, or see if you can land on your opponents piece.  I started to skip good moves just to try and make the game move along faster!  We eventually all decided to end the game and move on with life.",3.0
"The game just isn't that much fun for anyone over 6.  All you do is pop the dice and move your pieces.  I used it to enforce counting for my kids, but it bored me to tears.  It has the same concept as ""Sorry,"" but that one is just more fun with the same counting benefits.  As for the popper not working, ours was always fine and my 4-year-old can push it just fine.",3.0
"We like this game, despite my daughter's screams when she is send back again and my son's refusal to play the game for a couple of days after he has lost. It teaches essential skills of winning and losing, setbacks and gain. It's just good natured fun and at the end we all have a laugh.
What we don't like is the quality: the box is thin, the 'pop-o-matic' has a small crack after 2 plays (it works fine, just doesn't look good), piece of carton with rubber feet covered with plastic as the playing board, unattractive game pieces. Can they please go back and look at how this game was made a 30 years ago when I was a child??",3.0
"This is not the Trouble you might remember from childhood.  ""Chinky"" is the word that comes to mind - the bottom is a piece of flimsy cardboard, similar to what is used in cereal boxes.  Very disappointing!  I'd rather spend a bit more and get a quality product than get this garbage.  What a shame.",3.0
Same fun game just really cheap quality. Thin flimsy plastic board with a paper insert for the boar colors. I suppose the real version would cost a lot more.,3.0
"While this game is a classic and forever will be, the construction of the board, pegs and storage leave much to be desired.  The small pegs get stuck in the storage area. And both the small and slightly bigger pegs get all mixed up.",3.0
"This game doesn't really have a high educational value, unless you are teaching your child how to count from 1 to 6. It's just a simple game, with simple rules, that is fun for all ages.",3.0
"Love the game, but from the box to the contents, this is a cheaply made replica of the original.  You shouldn't pay more than $4.99 for this version.",3.0
"Like most of the other reviewers said... this game is made poorly.  All it is is a piece of flimsy plastic with a cutout cardboard tucked underneath it which is ""secured"" into place by 4 white pegs (which fall off for that matter).  They could have made it a lot better.",3.0
"Trouble is basically the same game as Sorry! or for that matter Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders.  In any of these games, the game can take an exceptionally long time if you or your pieces keep getting sent back to the beginning.  In any of these games, a cheating or difficult child can make a long game feel intolerable. By the time my 4 year old hits the zone when he can play this game without cheating or otherwise driving us crazy...my 7 year old will be 8 or 9, and will she still be interested?  Perhaps.

Anyway, the point of this review is a warning -- if games in this category (go backwards/forwards based mostly on luck) are not working for your child yet, i.e. and the cheating or not getting it and resulting acting up is driving you nuts, don't buy this one.  You might think maybe it will be better, based on your fond memories.  Its not better.  Its the same basic mechanic, and takes a good while to play.",3.0
"My two boys received this game as a gift a few days ago, and I was rather happy about that because I was thinking of buying this game for them myself.

Well, it proved to be too much of a logical leap from the simple board games my young boys have played to date to this beginning level strategy game.  Your milage may vary on this point, but two aspects of this game that didn't help were:

First, the ""Pop-o-matic"" takes considerable force to operate.  My five year old had to put his full 50lb body weight onto it just to get it to work, and it was difficult for my old son to operate too.

Second, the ""have to roll a six to get to start"" rule is stupid.  You just wait forever to get to even start to play.  We changed the rule so you can start with either a six or a one, and that helped a little bit.

Sadly, my kids lost interest after about 10 minutes.  So, another unloved game in the game pile.",3.0
Not made as well as it was in the 1980's.  The grandkids still have fun with it but it could be made better,3.0
"I actually bought this myself but I did not now any better (1st time mom).  This toy is dangerous if you leave it alone with your baby.  If you purchase it, always keep one hand on it to prevent your baby from hitting himself.  I don't know about you but I don't like seeing my baby get hurt!",3.0
"The information for this rattle suggests it is for age 3 months and on. My baby is quite large for her age, but this rattle is still a bit heavy for her at 3 months. Its also a bit bulky. Its pyramid like shape extends out about 5 inches each of its sides. Not the best for traveling with.
I think this rattle is more appropriate for 5 or 6 month old babies and up... not 3.",3.0
"It's a rattle, a teether, and sometimes my son puts his foot through it and shakes it with his leg. My active, highly curious son still likes this rattle at 8 months.  The pyramid shape keeps him entertained and he seems to like watching the little balls move around in it.",3.0
Bought this for our 7 yr old grand daughter. She was happily surprised when she got it because she's been asking for one but this one is nothing more than a calculator.  The card beeps. This did not keep her attention long at all. Now our 4 yr grand daughter is a different story. She loved it! Hope this helps.,3.0
low quality.,3.0
"I used to love this game growing up so I got it for my daughter for Christmas. The game itself is great, one person creates a code, the other tries to crack it. That's the same as it was. What's not the same however, is the quality - shocker! It's very flimsy, cheap plastic and the little don't stay in the holes very well. Also, there is a red compartment that is supposed to keep track of the pieces, but it doesn't latch or anything so it is pretty much worthless. My daughter loved the game though, so it was a decent enough purchase, it just could've been manufactured so much better.",3.0
A more fun version of rubric's cube type games.  Older elementary school kids really like it.,3.0
"I like many other adults rember this game from when I was a child.  My wife and I purchased it as a Christmas gift for our kids. My kids love the game, and have they have lots of fun playing it.  Educationally they learn to count and strategize as part of the game(which piece to move, what pieces are at risk).

The construction of the game seems quite flimsy compared to the game I had as a young boy.  The kids have to really push down on the bubble to get the die to jump.

Another interesting note, this isn't a complaint, just an observation.  With four players the game takes a little longer to play, all four of us were knocking opposing players back to home every few turns.  This didn't seem to bother the kids too much, they enjoyed forcing their siblings pieces home, but it happened so often that I commented to my wife that the game might take all day...

Overall the game is fun and the kids enjoy playing it. Sometimes a player can get stuck waiting for a six (we allow 1 and 6 to speed up the game), and there are some games where everyone keeps getting their game pieces sent home, in games like that my kids begin to stop sending other players pieces home.  The quality of the product itself is rather cheap, and the little ones have to push the bubble with both hands to get it to pop but I wouldn't let that stop me from purchasing this game.",3.0
"My 8 yr old loves playing this game as it is simple but fun.  As others have said, waiting to get a 6 to start can get really frustrating.  The popper is definitely tough to push, even for my 8 yr old and sometimes for me.  You feel like it if you push too hard it might just crack.

Since the game does not cost much and is even cheaper if you get it during the B1G1F promos, it still is a big disappointment as a parent.  I'd like to have a sturdier box that actually had a lid instead of a flimsy one that only opens on the side.  The playing board is a single piece of clear plastic that you place the thin cardboard colored piece under and it is held in place by the 4 rubber feet.  As another reviewer said, I'd rather pay more money and have a better quality game and box.

Nonetheless, my son likes to play it as it doesn't require a lot of thinking.  It has some educational value in helping younger kids learn to count.  However, we tend to like Sorry more than Trouble as it has a little more variety and you don't get stuck for too long waiting to play.",3.0
"This rattle keeps my son entertained, but it's hard plastic and when he starts swinging it, sometimes he hits himself in the head or face and he doesn't like that! It is hard to find soft or plush rattles with handles that can be used as teethers. So, I just keep an eye on him when he's playing with this one so that he doesn't accidentally get hurt.",3.0
"My (6 year old) daughter received this classic for Christmas and we played the game that evening. Suffice it to say, the instuctions are the same and the fun of the game is the same as when I received it as a gift MANY years ago, however the durability has gone down hill big time. I cannot believe how cheap it is now, from the cheesy cardboard used with the graphics under the board, to the cheaper feeling plastic used for the pegs. The popomatic dice keeper even feels cheap and 1/2 the time my daughter pops it, it remains on the same number on the dice. Aren't there any companies out there that take pride in their products anymore? It seems not. I can't wait to open the Connect Four game - hopefully it won't fall apart before we play it.",3.0
"I'm a 27 year old mother of 3.  I remember loving this game when I was a kid. I was so dissapointed when I opened this game. I couldn't believe how cheesey it is.  You can barely 'POP' the dice.  And when my kids POP the bubble all the game pieces fly around. Plus the bottom of the game has a pop in piece of cardboard.  Shouldn't the bottom be covered with hard plastic??

I also wish there was something to hold all the pieces because my kids (like many others) abuse the box and all of the pieces fall out and get lost.

****Can't the board game makers start making harder cases or Tins so we all don't have a stack of smashed boxes and missing pieces.

The game itself is fun...but I ended up throwing it away because pieces got lost way to fast.",3.0
"Love the game, but there are 2 major flaws:
1. My son has some color blindness. This has never caused an issue playing games, but he can't decipher the color differences on a few of these odd colors of pegs. This creates errors or him having to ask a question showing what is right & wrong.
2. The storage compartment is lousy. It doesn't latch & often won't even fully close. We accidentally spilled a bunch of the smaller pegs putting the game away in the closet. It's now held shut by a heavy rubber band.

The game itself is fun, and is good with thinking & strategy. Had I know the issues above, we would have preferred the old version.",3.0
I loved this game when I was younger and ordered it for my children. But... this game is so cheaply made now! A thin cardboard bottom has the graphics (comes seperated not integrated) and rips VERY easily. The popper is of a thin bent metal tension design that doesn't pop reliably. Very frustrating! We ended up buying a vintage game on [auction site] and love it!,3.0
This item is very cheap plastic.,3.0
"Unfortunately the colors on the pegs are strange.  They are off shades.  You would hope for Red, Green, Yellow, White, Orange.... but that is not what you get.  you get these strange off shades.  Just stick to the normal colors Pressman Toys.",3.0
This version is pretty cheaply made and not as sturdy or well-made as the one I had as a kid.,3.0
7 year old grandson played with this one time. Didn't care for it. He was bored. I feel it was over priced for a plastic one person game. Not happy.,3.0

Excellent game just poorly designed case.,3.0
"This is an awesome game. I have no complaints about the game itself. My girls, ages 4 to 8, all love it (though it's really best for at least age 6). However, the quality of the game is cheap. Within about a week, the cap that holds the pieces in place with the game broke right off. It has a very small plastic piece that allows the cap to open and shut. Also, even when the cap worked properly, it barely held all the pieces and most of the time the little pegs fell out. The plastic is light and cheaply made - would gladly pay $5-10 more for a higher quality game as this is the kind of game you hang on to or even pass down.",3.0
"Still the same awesome game I played as a kid! Great service, great delivery, great product. Little red & white pegs can be tricky to get out at times.",3.0
"I had played this game with friends in high school, and I wanted my kid sister to experience the same game I had come to enjoy. I ordered this from Amazon after seeing how much it's been updated.

This is the tried and true Mastermind, but this version isn't the best. The pegs are round, making them hard to grab for larger fingers, and the shield is too short, making it difficult to place the pegs in where you want. My kid sister, who was 7 at the time, even had a hard time.

Also, while the traditional Mastermind had four pegs, we found that we flew through games too quickly. I ended up replacing this with Ultimate Mastermind, and I heartily recommend that one over the standard release.",3.0
"The game Mastermind is still as much fun as it was when it came out in the 1970s, but the redesign is crummy.  Assuming you can get past the rather jarring colors -- I much preferred the primary colors of the original -- the game board is overly large and clunky and yet the ""built-in storage tray"" is not actually large enough to accommodate the pegs and close when not in use (!?!).  This game, while still better than the kids' version, is definitely a downgrade from the original.",3.0
"I have owned versions of this game in the past, and recently bought this model. Unfortunately, the pin storage bins are not well separated, and you cannot simply close the lid and expect the pins not to fall out. The shield that block's the player's view of the target configuration is also very loose and easily tips to accidentally prematurely reveal the solution.

Mastermind is a great game. This is, however, not one of the best models I've ever owned or enjoyed.",3.0
There are electronic apps of this same game and I kind of regret getting this game because it would be just as well to let my kids play this on an app instead.  We brought it in the car and it was tough to keep the pieces in place....,3.0
"This game is as fun and challenging as I remembered it.  However, I'm not sure it was the same level of junk back in the, well, you know, a while ago.  The ""lid"" on the ""compartment"" for the little pieces broke off on the first opening.  It turns out it was connected by two millimeter sized pegs.  Literally.  So, enjoy the game (my 8 year old nephew was immediately taken) but don't count on quality.",3.0
"Mastermind is just as fun as ever.  They are using new colors, but whatever.  Now it looks like tropical Skittles if you like that; it doesn't change the game.

However, they have these little compartments along one side meant to hold the various pegs. The compartments are really poorly designed. The pegs get in the edges and keep you from shutting the compartments and the pegs are hard to get at.  Bleh, they managed to break a good thing.",3.0
The game itself is a great game. The red/white pegs to say what you got right are very small and slightly difficult to put in. The code that you put in is sometimes hard to get in behind the blocker. Despite those two things the game is a lot of fun and definitely worth getting.,3.0
"The box arrived crushed, however the game inside was unscathed. This is a fun game for 2 people, but the packaging wasn't so great.",3.0
"I grew up with this game.  I love being able to figure out the algorithms and trick my opponents. With these thoughts in mind I purchased a set for my high school English classroom.  I was disappointed in the new design.  While the colors are nice the pieces seem more flimsy.  Also the storage area is not big enough.  To keep the small pieces and large pieces separate is practically impossible, so you are constantly trying to fish for small pieces among the large pieces. This game is great and it is different than what my students are use to, but the design is disappointing.",3.0
"The game play is very fun, but I wish I had spent a little more on a better product.  The pieces are difficult to get in and out of the board and there are too many to actually store in the bin.",3.0
"Great game for kids and adults! But when I was a child, my dad had one that was harder and better in materials. But for the same replica and same fun... it's worth every penny. My child loves it now as much as I did at her age. Great game!",3.0
"My little ones like this.  It doesn't have much replay value as once they know where all the ""riddle"" items are they won't change...:)  I thought the riddles were going to be that.  I wanted critical thinking.  They are just mainly telling the kids to find things on the cards instead of making them think about what really they are looking for...not sure if that makes sense...:)  It is good for the memory game though.",3.0
"For a young child this may hold more intrigue, but as an adult, once you have done all the riddle cards (solitaire or in a group game) you tend to remember where everything is, taking away the fun challenge. With new riddles I could enjoy this game daily.
The memory game (all cards face down) is a challenge every time.
Not the greatest game out there, but worth the price for occasional fun.
A card game like Spot It is a somewhat similar concept and more fun to us on a regular basis.",3.0
"I remember playing this game when I was young so I had to get it for my kids.
This particular model is made of fairly cheap plastic.
The built-in storage container is a nice idea but this one doesn't close well. I can't imagine picking up 100s of pieces off the floor.
The game is great but this model is not worth the price. I would have got a better model at a local store if I waited a bit longer.",3.0
My kids love the game when they play it at my mother's house but that one is a durable set. This one is a cheap imitation and the part that hides the pawns fell off almost right away.,3.0
Not what I expected -- just a whole bunch of cards and lots of instructions for play.  I would still recommend it as someone else may have different opinion.,3.0
"This is a decent little board game based on the I Spy books that my five-year-old has loved for months. We've played a couple of times and the game is similar to the books in that you're looking for specific small/well disguised items surrounded by many other things. Neither of my sons have asked to play it again, so it's been sitting on the shelf for a week or so, but I'm sure they'll pick it up soon and ask to play. All in all this is a good game if you're really into the I Spy thing, but it doesn't ignite any fireworks or make you want to play again and again.",3.0
"This is a fun game and easier if used as just a card matching game. It is difficult when using the clues. The picture cards are very ""busy"" and I had a hard time finding some items to match my clues. My 3 year old is much too young for this game. My 5 1/2 year old has a hard time trying to find all of the matches for her clues. It takes a long time to play and at her age it's not one of her favorite games. It's better for older children.",3.0
"This is a really fun game, although I wouldn't start it on kids under age 8 without some adult help.  I love to play Mastermind, and my (older) son and I have great fun with it.  This version, however, is terrible.  They've given us a storage component that is divided into two pieces, but if you put all the pegs in one compartment, the door won't close.  The smaller of the two compartments is supposed to be for the smaller pegs, but there is no way to keep them divided - they are all over each other in seconds.  AND you don't really get enough of the smaller pegs.  Those that we do have include some that are broken.

If you buy this anyway, I recommend placing all the larger pegs in one plastic bag, and all the smaller pegs in another small plastic bag, then shoving them into the box.  The box is, oddly, taken up by a large piece of cardboard for no apparent reason - thereby deleting half the storage space for the game.  I won't buy from this company again - but I sure do have fun with the game.  I'm off to buy replacement parts - if I can find them - so that we'll have enough smaller pegs....",3.0
"Mastermind is a great strategy game; my wife and I really enjoy playing it.  Unfortunately, this particular model of the game is made very cheaply.  The base was a very thin plastic that was warped upon arrival, but not unusable.  The flimsy covers for the code and pegs feel like they will break very easily.  The section to store all the pegs isn't even big enough to fit all the pegs in.  Also, we aren't huge fans of the peg colors.  These pegs are neon pink, neon orange, white, purple, yellow, and neon green.  Not very easy on the eyes.

Aside from the nitpicking on this being a very cheaply made product, the game is still very functional and we will enjoy the hours of use we can get out of it.  It's a good purchase if you're just looking to get a good game to play between two friends or family members.",3.0
"Good game.  Bad game board.

The game board is cheap.  The colored pegs are smooth and round and difficult to hold.  The marker pegs are tiny and the spaces to put them are too close together.  It's hard for a grown man (father or grandfather) to fit his fingers under the shield to hide the code.  There is a compartment to hold both types of pegs, but it's too small to hold all the pegs!  So I have two little plastic bags taped to the bottom of the board.

All that's just operational annoyance.  But they actually changed the game from the one I played years ago - it's no longer possible to place the tiny marker pegs in order corresponding to the colored pegs, which was a good option for younger kids or those just learning the game; marker pegs are in a little square next to the row of colored pegs, rather than in a row as in the original game.

The box it comes in is more than twice as large as the game board requires and made of very thin material, so it's headed straight for recycling when you receive the game.

I purchased this for our granddaughter's birthday, but it's so chincey that I feel bad giving it as a gift.  I wish Amazon.com offered a more useful game board that cost two or five or even ten dollars more.",3.0
"I just purchased this game for my kids as I remember loving it as a kid myself. The newer version is so flimsy, I don't enjoy playing it as much. The game itself is wonderful. I love that it helps my kids build their thinking skills. Love the game, hate the aweful quality of the new version and wish they had just kept the game as it was 30 years ago.",3.0
"My kids learned to play the original Mastermind at their Nana's house at Christmas, so I went online and bought this for them. It is the same idea: six colors of pegs, four holes, and you try to crack the code that the code maker has made. But I have to say that this is quite possibly the worst-designed game board I have ever used. Many of the small pegs literally do not fit into the holes that they are supposed to be placed in. They are also so small that they are very hard to work with, especially for my six-year-old, who will delay the game trying her best to get the darn pegs in the holes for each turn. The larger pegs come in different colors than the original, and the orange and pink are close enough to each other that in the shadow of the cover it is hard to tell which color you have used. It is also hard to reach under that little cover to place the pegs in the holes. The storage area on the side isn't large enough to hold all of the pegs, rendering it useless, and the divider inside it isn't big or complete enough to keep the different sizes of pegs separated when you carry the board. I'm planning to go to eBay and buy an original version so that we don't have to mess with this one any more. It's too bad that they took something that worked perfectly well and remade it so poorly.",3.0
"I had this game when I was a kid and liked it.  I still do.  I like the kind of thinking it takes, and I like to see how my opponent is thinking.

So I got one to play with my kids, and noticed some things about the Pressman version that make the game less enjoyable than the Invicta version I had back in the day:

- The colors in the new version are terrible.  The plastic shield that hides the code from the code breaker puts the code into a dim light that makes it hard for me to distinguish the colors and compare them to the codebreaker's colors that are in better light (I am not colorblind, and my son had the same problem).  The old colors were bold, mostly primary, and visually distinctive: red, yellow, blue, green, white, and black.  The new colors are namby pamby and easy to confuse: pink/magenta, turquoise/teal, fluorescent orange, purple, yellow, and white.  I have to keep reminding myself that what I see in the code as ""green"" or ""blue"" is the same as the codebreaker's ""turquoise"", my ""red"" is his ""pink"", my ""purple"" is the same as his ""purple"", ""yellow"" is not ""white"", etc.  This is a logic game, not a color-recognition game.

- The shield keeps coming off and is a nuisance to reattach.  The old shield just set down on top and was held in place by gravity.  Simple.

A few other things:

- The box is really large.  The old game came in a right-sized box.  I think the idea is to just recycle the box since the board has storage space for the pegs, but I didn't like playing from the storage space for some reason.

- There are some numbered holes down the side of the board that seem intended to be used for keeping score, but they're not mentioned in the instructions and none of the pegs fit in them anyway.

My advice: get this game, it's a good one, but try to find a used Invicta version somewhere.",3.0
My son plays this game and loves the strategy involved.  For the quality of the playing pieces/board I think it is highly overpriced!,3.0
Change flies out every time the drawer is opened which is a pain.,3.0
"I bought this as an introduction to strategy games for my six-year-old year son.  As others have said, this is different than the Stratego of the 1980's.  The old pieces were etched with the soldier's profile and number; the new pieces have stickers.  I no longer have the old version to compare it to, but the new pieces seem cheaply made.  The board is okay and has decent artwork.  The biggest difference is that all the numbers have been reversed.  My first thought was why do I have so many Marshalls?  How am I going to clear the enemy bombs with only two 8's?

The changes in numbers and the build quality do not make this an unplayable game by any means.  If I'd never played Stratego before I wouldn't have noticed the numbering difference (my son certainly didn't care).  So that change is just nostalgia kicking in and I won't knock the game down for that.  I will knock it for the build quality.  Stratego, for me, is a four-star game, but due to the quality of the pieces in this edition three stars seems fair.

My now eight year-old-son and I have moved on to more complex Eurogames, but we still play a round of Stratego every once in a while.  For about a year, this was our go-to game and we enjoyed many hours of gameplay.",3.0
I felt like I had bought the game at a rummage sale. I expected better quality. Game appear quite used.,3.0
"This game is fun. It is not Amazing. It is a one play game most of the time, as in, you will play it once and then put it away till next time. It is not fun enough or big enough to play two or three times in a row For Most People.

I was thinking about purchasing it and then I saw the price! Not sure what makes this a nearly 75 dollar game, but there is no way I would pay that!",3.0
"Stratego is overrated. Stratego has some genuine ""cool"" factors to it. The notion of designing your own initial setup is very appealing; like a football coach. The concealed values are a cool aspect, and the power/ability variations of the pieces is always enjoyable.

Yet as a strategy game it is a failure.
There are two fundamental flaws with Stratego (in my opinion):

[Flaw 1]
He who attacks probably loses that game. Yet if both players are smart, they both delay and wait for the other to attack: this leads to unwise attacking just to avoid stalling the game.

Perhaps the game could be fixed by temporarily giving enhanced powers of mobility to those of your pieces that are in the opponent's territory. Maybe they could move diagonally, and maybe even strike opponent pieces diagonally. Or maybe they take on globe mobility where they could move from the extreme left edge of the board ""one square"" to the right edge of board (as if the board wrapped around like a globe).
Or maybe when a piece survives an attack within its home territory, it must remain exposed sideways until it can re-conceal again as it goes on the attack and enters the opponent's territory.

[Flaw 2]
The strongest piece is too powerful. Stratego would be better if weaker pieces could gang up on stronger pieces, somehow.

Once you attack and lose a highly valuable piece, overcoming that material/power deficit is even harder than in chess. Yet the game can drag on a loooong time before your advantaged opponent finally captures your flag.

---- ----

Stratego is mostly a kids game. A father will play with his son, but rarely do two men play Stratego. I enjoyed Stragego when I was 14 years old.
Kids love the cool aspects, and do not yet perceive the weaknesses and lackings in the game. Most adults who play abstract strategy board games soon perceive the problems with Stratego.

Consider buying Khet, or Quoridor, or even Twixt (if you can find a copy).",3.0
We love the game. The board came apart after about 3 or 4 uses. The game pieces are stickers on plastic. I know everything is made in China but does it have to be poorly made?,3.0
This register does not come with coin deposit which I know kids love.,3.0
"I'm not sure why they decided to change this board game. It was great the way it was all the way back in 1961. Because I was use to playing the game with the rank of the soldiers going in the opposite numerical direction, this game wasn't as appealing to me. I decided to just find the old version on ebay and purchased that. Other than that, the game is great! If you never played the old version of this, you will definately enjoy this version. Hours of fun!",3.0
Im normally a fan of all learning resource products and this was the first one to disappoint me. When you push the buttons it sounds like a tiny mouse squeak. And when you open the drawer it come flying out.  I think it would be nice to have enough dollar slots to seperate all denominations of the included bills.  My kids love it- but I expected a bit more for the price.,3.0

"My 8 year old daughter loves this cash register and uses it daily. It's both educational and fun! However, there is an issue that I feel other parents should be aware of and that is the fact that the cash drawer opens too fast or with too much force. This along with jagged corners can be unsafe and potentially cause harm. As evidenced by the scratch that my daughter received on her right inner forearm during her first day of play with this item. When the drawer opened the top right corner of the drawer caught her inner arm. After applying some Barbie band-aids and shedding a few tears she is very aware of this issue and keeps her arms out of the way when the drawer opens. Although she loves it and wants to continue to play with it I'm definitely going to make sure it's put away when my preschool aged nieces/nephews visit.",3.0
"Works great but after 2 days of using, a couple numbers would register a different number when pressed. The product was exchanged fast through the company but it is still frustrating.",3.0

"I like the idea of this toy, but it feels very fragile. I think if might daughter played with it more it might be an issues... but she's not really interested in it so it has held up. I don't think I would see it lasting in a daycare setting or something like that.",3.0
It does not make any beeping noises. I have replaced batteries to no avail. Id like to return and get another one please.,3.0
Wish I had got the one with the coin insert and the scale. My kids like it though!,3.0
"The cash register is great for our 3 years old as we are teaching him the concepts of basic addition and subtraction in a fun way. The cash drawer does pop open pretty aggressively which causes all the little plastic coins to scatter everywhere which is amusing to my son. He also loves punching the numbers on the working calculator. We did order the Red/Blue cash register as shown but ended up receiving a bright pink one instead. I don't really care that my son will be playing with a ""pink"" cash register but honestly it's just ugly but not worth the hassle of returning and getting a new one.",3.0
"For the price I paid (right at $35-around Christmas) I don't think it's worth the money.  It's basically a large calculator that beeps when you 'swipe' the card.  Also the little notepad is cute, but once it runs out there is just an empty spot.  My biggest issue is the drawer slams when it opens causing all the toy change to fly everywhere.  This happens every. single. time. The toy money itself is fantastic and realistic but, when the drawer opens it flies all over the place.  My daughter still enjoys playing with it (six months later).  But, she has asked me numerous times to fix the drawer.  And I have no idea how you would even do that.  Bottom line: cute, toy money is awesome, drawer is super annoying.",3.0
Great product for toddlers but a little over priced.,3.0
"I bought this as a end of school year gift for my daughter.  She's 6, which means she's full of pretend play and learning math.  The register itself is great which is why I don't have the heart (or patience) to return it because it's missing the notepad and credit card.  I'm sure it's just more things that would get lost in the long run, however, it'd have been nice if those items were included in the box in the first place.",3.0
"Whenever we would be at a friends house and they had a toy cash register, my daughter was head over heels. So I finally decided to get her her own. She likes the credit card slot and the money. The only bad thing is that when you open the drawer, it is quite forceful, so if you have this near the edge of a table, it can literally fly off.",3.0
"This register seems to be good quality, however I don't like that there aren't enough slots for the different types of bills.  You have to double up on two different types of bills in order to fit them in and that can be confusing to a child.  Also, they make another version with a scanner and it actually tells you how much a product is and then has the kids do the math on the calculator.  I think it's worth the extra investment.  My oldest is five, so this might just be more fitting for an older child who already understands more about money and arithmetic.",3.0
"We were sent the wrong color. It's pink not red and blue like the picture. I could return it, but we got it on one of those 'super deal of the day' so our kids will just have a pink cash register!",3.0

"This is technically a very nice little cash register with a built in solar-powered calculator. The concept of money, customer service and math are all utilized and it's a great product for those purposes. Love the product for that reason.

2 big complaints:

1. The solar-powered calculator is extremely annoying overall. My daughter can only see the digits on the calculator if she's got it under a light or in the window. It will totally stop working otherwise and she gets upset. There is a battery in the unit but no idea what it's for since it won't work when it's not in direct line of a light source.

2. The cash drawer flies open every time, causing the money to fly out everywhere. And it would be nice if the unit could make some kind of noise when you swipe the credit card. But whatever.

Overall, good product, but could use some tweaks.",3.0
"Child opened Christmas morning to find the drawer would not open by pushing ""open"" button.

"I bought this for my 9 year old. His dream is to own a restaurant when he gets older and he loves to play restaurant at home. This adds to the fun and I'm trying to show him I support his dream. In addition, this helps him to learn how to manage money because he has a few bills in his wallet and has to spend them to pay for the food when we play. He's also learning how quick money goes when it's spent and how to count it to make sure he's not ripped off by getting the wrong change back or the other way around. This register has So many benefits. I gave 3 stars though because it doesn't come with alot of coins nor bills. Plus, it only works in a really really bright light or our blinds and curtains have to be open for in order for the calculator to work. I've owned solar power calculators before and they work just fine in our house lighting. I'm not sure why this register doesn't.",3.0

"This play cash register is everything it professes to be......... And it worked perfectly, right out of the box.  Unfortunately, though we've only had it a couple weeks, the solar calculator no longer holds it's charge.  We can only operate the register by shining a desk lamp on the solar panel during use. We've even set it out in the sun for hours, to charge up the solar battery.  It looked as though the problem would be solved.  However, as soon as it was dark,we brought the register in, and the calculator function was ""dead"".  When we focused the desk lamp light directly on the solar panel again, it operated perfectly.  When we turned the light off, the calculator function also went ""out"".

I tried to do an internet research to see if the solar battery can be replaced, but thus far have not had any success in finding a method to do so.  Any ideas would be appreciated.",3.0
My daughter has lost interest in it very quickly.  No special functions so I must make up a grocery game with my daughter to use it.  I price items and she must give me change for buying them.  To bad they didn't include stickers that could be used to make change to teach math.,3.0
"I have hosted several of these in the past. This one is not the best in the series, by far.

It was still a lot of fun, but not as much fun as others.",3.0
"I bought this cash register for my 4-year old, but with the intention of having my 7-years use it as well.  They love to play ""store"" together, and I thought a working cash register would be fun.  We've only had it for a week and everything seems to be working fine so far.  The only complaint I have--and it's a big one--is that the calculator does not have a ""currency"" mode.  My 7-year olds are learning to calculate sums and change, and it's confusing that this calculator is not set to the standard 0.00.  If the sum is 3.50, it displays as 3.5.  If you multiply something to calculate tax (as my kids are doing), it comes out to 3 decimal places such as 5.855.  I guess it creates an opportunity for me to teach them more about decimals, but it would have been nice if the display were actually like a real cash register instead of just a cheap calculator with no option to change settings.",3.0

When I received it, it occurred to me that it comes with 4 different bills, 1,5,10, & 20 yet there are only 3 slots.  This is very confusing to my preschooler who is learning money denominations.  Also, the register noise sounds more like a bird squeak than a realistic register noise.  I still give it 3 stars because it withstands my kids pounding on it everyday and the numbers are still very pronounced and the buttons still work.",3.0
"This is a rather simple product, which is generally not bad, but it is also fragile, which IS bad. Its dealing with little kids hands, which requires in my opinion some more sturdyness. The calculator broke after a very short time for no particular reason.

I thought I was buying the newer version of this game with the CD but instead I got the cassette, which is a little harder to play nowadays. Also the name tags are not sticky, just a sheet of hard paper, so I had to find my own. The invitations did not come with costume suggestions, only in the Host Guide.",3.0
This game was alright. It was really fun to see all of my friends dressed up and i very much liked the theme. The problem was that the box smelled horribly on the inside that i felt sick while i was writing the invitations. i also expected the game to be different. i expected it to be more of a mingling game but we kind of sat around in a circle group and did it. the plot also gets confusing and has a sort of bad ending.,3.0

"This is potentially a great learning toy that can grow with a child for a long time.  Unfortunately a few things keep it from reaching it's potential.  First of all, it only beeped when pushing a button for a couple of days before it stopped working.  I replaced the battery with a new, $5 battery, and it still doesn't work.
Secondly, it's great that the calculator is solar powered, but it really needs to have a battery, and perhaps a back light.  This thing only works well in direct, BRIGHT light.  The money that you save not buying a $1 AA battery once a year is more than offset by having to have all of the lights up bright in your house to be able to play with this toy.

Positives:  Great for teaching math and money skills.  I love that the drawer can accommodate real-sized money.

I just wish that it would work without having to keep it pointed at the sun, and that the beeping feature would hold up more than one weekend.

Less into the slapping and yelling games of chance.  We've owned Hiss, Zeus on the Loose, Sleeping Queens, Slamwich, and a few other Gamewright games.  They are now going into the rummage sale box.  I just think these are good for the younger kids who are not yet ready for longer strategy games like backgammon or chess, or even life or monopoly.  We've just moved on.",3.0

The redesigned version is hard to follow for 3-4 year olds who don't recognize written numbers up to 100 and have a hard time following the arrows for which way to go.  So do mom and dad!  A path rather than a grid would be much easier. The main problem is the moving pieces...they keep on moving every time the board is slightly bumped - which happens all the time with children. In other words, they tip over WAY too often, thus losing your place on the board. The designers need to do some major changes.  It still is a good game for teaching children that sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and for counting how many spaces to move.",3.0
"This game is enjoyable, however, a bit frustrating for a 3-4 year old, whom may not know their bigger numbers.  My child often did not know at which direction to go because of the big numbers.  For 3-4 year old, Candyland is better, and for any older, Chutes & Ladders would be preferable.",3.0

My complaint is the quality of the cards. After a few rounds of the game, several of the cards began to ""dog ear,"" on the corners making the cards a little cumbersome in your hand. I don't know why they could not simply include high quality cards. A regular deck of cards is much higher quality. Like I said above, the game is CARDS AND A BELL! Can't you spend a few more cents and give quality cards with the game? The game is all about exchanging cards to other players, sliding them across the table, etc. at a fast pace. Does it not make sense to include cards that can hold up to that type of play?

My concern is that I will probably only get a dozen or two full games out of it before many of the cards are too damaged to use. Put, Pit is fun and a great group game...therefore 3 stars. This game is a Grade A idea with Grade D quality.",3.0
disappointed with how the characters look on this game. I miss the old days...,3.0
As par for the course the quality of this game is not what it once was. The graphics are no longer as pleasing and the quality of the game pieces and board is so poor compared to when I was young. All this said though my 3 year old enjoys playing the game so I'm glad I bought it.,3.0
Great classic game but the new design are way too cartoony and yucky. Why not go back to the classic look?,3.0
"This is the same game as i grew up with, but like many other things as well the quality is no where near the same as it was in my childhood.",3.0
"It seems they decided to try and cut cost with this one and it's quite noticeable. The old set we played with our friends before they moved away had different colors for the commodities which makes it a lot easier. With this set we kept having false-positive wins because all of the cards are the same color and players kept confusing commodities. Also, the cards themselves are lower quality. This game involves a lot of frantic passing of cards and it's pretty clear that this set isn't durable enough to last very long.",3.0
"not the same quality made as when I was a kid, but then nothing is",3.0
"As far as an easy, no strategy, purely based on luck game goes, this one is alright. Simply said you draw a card and move to that color on the board. First one to reach the end wins and that is it. Great for young kids and fun enough to keep their attention for some time.

My issue with it in they have gotten rid of Lord Liquorice who was a slightly (and i mean slightly) scary character removing the villain of from the game. Although this does not effect the game play at all, I find it ridiculous that the makers did this.",3.0
"Great game, but not as good as when I was a child back then the board and the spaces were bigger, there were cards to draw (the turn table is quite cheap). I prefered the grafics of when I was a kid.",3.0
"It's a neat toy, but my toddler has very little interest. He'll just open and close it over and over again. I mainly use it as a calculator. My son tried to eat the coins. So the only thing that's in it are the bills.",3.0
"I bought this for a gift. However, it came in a brown box....like a refurbished product. Well, that was a bummer since kids like to tare the wrapping and immediately see whats inside.",3.0
Kids think it is boring,3.0
The bell is nice but I'm very disappointed that the cards aren't colorized. If that matters to you then don't order this version.,3.0
"The only thing I didn't like about the product is the material the cards are made out of. The paper used is pretty flimsy, comparable to cheap playing cards material. I wish they would use more durable material, like maybe the same stuff Bicycle playing cards are made of. Seeing as how this can be a very aggressive game with people shoving and grabbing the cards, having it made of durable material is a must. I opened the game at a friend's place; after just a few games, a lot of the cards were bent. I don't think my set will last too long before I'd have to replace it.",3.0
This game is pretty fun. It doesn't hold my 5 year olds attention for more than one game though.,3.0
"Iconic game, had when i was a child and wanted to share with my 4.5 year old. Unfortunately the squares are so close together or rather small that it's hard for her to count each separately and not be skipping around. Could just be her age, but i would not buy this version again. I picked it up because it was under $7 bucks and liked the deal, so it's still fun to play, just a little tough for this age.",3.0
Decent product but kids will break this within minutes.,3.0
ok,3.0
"This game has all the ease of the original Candyland, but instead of a simple board, it's now visual overload. There's no negative space and it's just awash with color. I would've rather got the original.",3.0
"These blocks are big and that was why I bought them. However, I didn't look at the picture carefully - had I done that I would have seen that these blocks have capital letters on all six sides. I was looking for blocks with capitals, small letters, numbers and maybe pictures on the sides. That being said, my daughter and I have a lot of fun stacking the blocks and knocking them down. They do have slightly sharp edges (I guess like all wooden blocks)and so if you step on them or if you have a child who is learning to walk and falls on them, that would really hurt!",3.0
"I like the clear, modern graphics on these blocks.  On the downside, the blocks are soft and have a few internal (not edge) cracks.  They won't be heirlooms, but they are perfectly adequate for banging around and stacking by my one-year-old.",3.0
"I am disappointed with this game.  In order to make it fun,
you need three or more players.  Also, it becomes quite
repetitious as there is only one way it can be played. Too
expensive for what you get.",3.0
"For the price I was thinking it would be a little more entertaining for my toddler. The buttons just make a little ""beep"" no exciting noises or anything. I would think this is more for older children (5-8) that want to practice math since it has a real calculator.",3.0
"The younger players tend to get bored and it's hard for them to count in a row, back and forth the whole way up the board.  We honestly haven't played it as much as any of our other games for this reason.  I have children who are 3 and 5.  The 5 year old is starting to understand going back and forth.  It was easier for me to move their pieces for them, which wasn't fun for them.",3.0
Came in good condition. My only complaint is that I was hoping for graphics that were ore vintage.,3.0
Candyland is a classic for good reason. The board is an appealing candy paradise. This game is a great introduction for children to the world of board games. they learn how to take turn and win (and lose!) graciously. The reason i gave this game only 3 stars is because it doesn't require much thinking skills other than color recognition. Players win by luck only and not by strategy.,3.0
"The game board is very visually cluttered compared to the version we played as kids. A number of the arrows are obscured by the chutes, which means that littler kids can't really anticipate where they are going next.",3.0
"I received these today.  They are smaller than I anticipated, but based on what I plan to use them for, it will be fine.",3.0
"Not the game I remember from the 80s, but it will do for my little boy. The board seems more compact than it used to be, and the squares are not as spread out. I guess some things can't always remain the same, even Candy Land.",3.0
"Wasn't really made well, breaks easy. Might want to re-think a fake cash register for a 4 year old for sure!",3.0
I like these blocks but the quality could be better.  The ink is smeared on a lot of the letters and the box was cracked on both the top and bottom were cracked when I received it.,3.0
"I didn't realize how small they'd be, which is on me for not reading the details better.",3.0
"This game is a blast.  fast action, lots of interaction amoung your friends... the discription of this particular game mentions ""casino style, or type"" of cards... i had imagined a stiffer more slick like it had some coating on it to make it last longer type of card.  That is not what came in this package.  There might be others out there with the stiffer type card that will last longer but the cards in my box were non coated and basically flimsy.  I would not recommend this set.  it is a great game and the cards will get handled fairly roughly as you pass them back and forth between the other 'traders' in the game... often pushing them at the other person as you grab for their cards... anyway... that is my review for this purchase... great game, this set the cards were lacking in my opinion.",3.0
"I bought this game last year an I really loved so I gave it to my parents and I bought other one this month. The product I received the second time is not the same, I would say it is lower quality now since the cards are not different in color any more so it is difficult to play and not as fun anymore",3.0
"The family has gotten hooked by card games.  We're playing mille bornes, Five Crowns, Uno, Loot, etc.  We bought Pit at the same time as the other games.  My 6 year old loves it the best as, like reviewers will tell, lots of yelling and trading cards.  For the rest of us, including a 10 year old, the novelity wore off in a few days.

Each game only takes a few minutes with 4 players.  The object is to keep trading cards until you have a complete set of 9.  It's not very hard to do and is mindless - just trade away the cards you don't need.  The yelling and the bell does make it as fun as this game can be.  But, for a longer, more involved game, with a hint of using your brain, there are far better choices than Pit.  We'll still play it for laughs, but it certainly won't get the play time of the others we play.",3.0
Only one face of the block is what I would call finished.  You can see that if you zoom in on the picture.,3.0
Blocks are smaller than expected,3.0
"They're okay. They're unevenly sized. Every block is a little different. In my mind, blocks should be uniform in size.",3.0
"Fun, fast playing game yet the cards could be improved by making each type a different color.

Suggested age is 7+ yet my 3-year-old grasps the concept well.  If only the cards were color coded.  It is a pain sorting a stack of cards with boring / similar images all printed in black and white.

Instead, we play Pit using colorful UNO cards (bright colors) and simply ignore the symbols.  All you really need are the game instructions which you can find on the company's website.",3.0
Bought for a 3 year old.  I don't think it was age appropriate and I haven't seen it played with at all.,3.0
"My kids loved this game, so I bought it for our grandson, but I didn't realize I could've gotten it cheaper at Walmart.",3.0
I  the board is overly busy. There are to many bright graphics and the squares on the path are to small for the game pieces. I find it to disturbing to play. You eyes needed a place too rest on the board. Ask any designer. Too much input just disturbs the brain.,3.0
"I like candy land, but the old version. Go with one from the 80s/90s.",3.0
I bought this for a 4 yr old who has enjoyed Candyland.  It requires skills that are more advanced.  It is difficult to play if counting skills (1-100) are not somewhat developed since you have to transfer the number on the spinner to the board when the spinner is 1-6.  The board itself is rather visually cluttered.  The spinner was a problem in that the cardboard was warped and the spinner kept getting stoppped.  We'll try it again in a few months but for now it is on the shelf.,3.0
Not clear enough about size or age appropriateness.,3.0
"My 3-year old granddaughter loved it.  Started playing with it immediately.  Her older brother discovered it was also a calculator, so he played with it too!",3.0
These are great... just be careful very pointy and sharp edges for infant.  Maybe better for a toddler. We are saving them for when our son gets  little bit older.,3.0
"I expected the blocks to be a little bigger, but other work really well!",3.0
"I ordered this game online during the holidays as I wanted to avoid the crowds in the stores. Next time, I will go to the store to buy this as I would have saved 5 dollars! Overall a classic game where beginning number counting/recognistion skills are taught in a fun way.",3.0
I got the classic game for my 5 month old daughter. I knew it was going to be a-while before she was able to play it but it was on sale and its a classic kids game.,3.0
"Found it for almost $4 cheaper at Walmart...be sure to shop around so you don't end up stuck with it like me. On top of that, this newly redone version is very flimsy, easy to rip and won't last very long, unlike our old board games made of real cardboard and actuall pieces, not just paper-like cardboard cutouts...I would expect this to be something sold at a discount store or the $1 store. They just don't make them like they used to.",3.0
I'd love to see chutes and ladders redone with more durable pieces and a more durable board. But...this game will always be in our home :),3.0
My kids like playing with the drawers and money.  The play money is easy to rip.  not a fantastic toy but it serves it's purpose as a cash register for toddlers,3.0
"Its chutes and ladders, it should be simple fun. You spin the spinner move your spaces, hit a ladder, go up, hit a chute, come down. There are a lot of fun pictures on the game board, however, it makes it hard to see the numbers, or the directional arrows.

As this game is supposed to be for the super young this becomes a big frustration. The standee pieces are cardboard which is fine but after playing a few games the bottoms or our characters are fraying.

They made it cheap to be affordable, so you get what you pay for here.",3.0
I bought this as a Christmas gift.  I have not tried it.  Delivery was very prompt.  The price was excellent.,3.0
Classic and great beginner game for toddlers and little ones.,3.0
"Shipping was fine, game was in fine condition. The kids had more fun assembling the spinner and game pieces than actually playing it. Maybe they'll enjoy it when they're older,  my oldest is 4.",3.0
"This is a fine counting game for young kids.  I have to echo what others have said though and say that it really should have more arrows on the path for kids to follow.  And the cardboard pieces are a serious design flaw.  I really don't mind the cheap pieces, it's not like this game is very expensive, but they don't fit in the box unless you take them apart first.  The cardboard will fray and you will be lucky if the game makes it to a second child.

The board is too busy as well.  Simple ladders and slides would be fine.  Instead, the designers seem to be attempting to teach lessons by having ""good"" deeds go forward and ""bad"" deeds go back.  But they don't make sense and some are not appropriate for the age the game is intended.  One of the ""good"" deeds shows a kid bandaging a dog's leg.  Who thinks a young kid should be touching an injured animal?  Another shows a kid mowing the lawn.  Should a 4-year-old be anywhere near a lawnmower?  Yes, I know these are just silly illustrations, but they're so unnecessary.  You might spend most of the game explaining the pictures instead of playing the game.",3.0
"I am not sure if there are different versions of this game, but my daughter got this for a gift, and while it is fun to play, it can be confusing at times. The board needs to have less pictures on, and more arrows pointing to which direction you are going. For little ones who like to play this, it is sometimes easy to forget which direction you are going and end up going the wrong way! (lol! I have done it myself).  The board seems a bit too ""busy"", and the numbers are very small, with only a small arrow at the beginning of each line.  The only other negative I have is that the game pieces are a cheap cardboard that must be put together before each play (otherwise if you don't take them apart they won't fit into the box ).  This means that the cardboard will eventually become frayed at the bottom where you stick the pieces into the plastic bases.  They really should be one solid plastic piece. So I give the game designers 0 stars, and the 3 stars are for game concept and overall fun factor.",3.0
This arrived not in a separate box but in the product package.  The package is all beat up and torn.  I am not sure if it will work and hopefully the little girl it is intended for will not be disappointed in the packaging.  If it does not work it will be sent back after Christmas!!  Looks like it would be a good learning tool and recommended for this purpose by school.,3.0
"This is close to the classic snakes & ladders we played as children, but it is not very durable. The playing pieces are little folded cardboard characters that fit into plastic stands. The spinner does not work well. We replaced ours with a die. (I keep extra dice on hand for games like that). My son (age 4) can count to 100, but sometimes he still gets confused as to which way to go and occasionally wants to ""climb"" a ladder when his spot crosses halfway instead of at the bottom.

Classic? Yes.

Durable? No.

Fun? Not very.

Candy land is much better and if you've got the cash, Balloon Lagoon is a blast.",3.0
Nice blocks. Just wish the description matched what we actually received. There are not any numbers or pictures on the blocks. But they are nice blocks,3.0
"The paint on the blocks is not that great. Just open it after it came in the mail and they look used and old. I am only going to use for photos and not let my daughter play with then, since they seem dirty and I can't clean them",3.0
"I bought it as a gift, but when opened i feel the quality is not what I expected but the kid loves it so no complains per se.",3.0
"You don't get the one in the pic, it's a girly version unlike the original.",3.0
"Please change the description to make it absolutely clear these blocks are letters only, not letters, numbers, symbols, and objects as described. The description on this site is deceptive & therefore the product is disappointing upon arrival. I expect better from Amazon based on my experience with them.",3.0
Actual size is smaller than picture.,3.0
Love to teach my little one letters & numbers. The only thing I don't like is the paint comes off when they chew on the blocks.,3.0
"Plastic slide lid was cracked when received.  Blocks are not as described.  They only have letters, no numbers or objects.  Smelly.",3.0
For the description to say large I thought they would be bigger . But they are nice  for my  new grandson .,3.0
"somewhat dissapointed by this learning toy

heres why....

add $1.25 + 1.75 =  $2....it leaves off the decimal points

that is not what you want when you are trying to teach someone about money/decimals and fractions/parts of a dollar...

the other negative, is when the cash draw flys open and the plastic coins fly out, all over the place

I had high hopes...

In contrast, even though it doesn't look as fun, is this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Texas-Instruments-TI-15-Scientific-Calculator-2-Line-s-11-Character-s-Battery-Solar-Powered/dp/B00ATZG3BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Texas Instruments TI-15 Scientific Calculator - 2 Line(s) - 11 Character(s) - Battery Solar Powered</a>&nbsp;for  kids !

"A decent toy, but our 3yo was too young despite that being the minimum suggested age. He had fun ripping up the paper money (sigh), and occasionally gets the coins stuck up behind the register tray requiring a parent to figure out how to extract them and open the jammed tray.  I'd suggest closer to 4-5 as a minimum age.",3.0
"I was very excited to get this item so I could spell out things for my photo-shoots...

I am very sad to say that the one and only time I went to use it, there is no letter ""Z""...

how do you have alphabet blocks with no letter Z?

I had to turn an N upside down and use it as the Z... It was ok but looked a little funny you could tell it was not a ""Z""

The second problem I had was the yellow is really hard to see. The yellow block letters with the yellow boarder wasn't the best choice of coloring. Maybe it should have been White or black.

Another problem I had was I had to use miss matched blockes and colors to spell out what I was trying to spell.. I wanted to use all blue letters but I couldn't, that would have been fine but I had to use some small letters and some block letters in the middle of the word... It just didn't look quite right...

The last problem I had was I wish the blocks were larger sized.. I was a little mislead when I ordered them I thought they were large blocks... they are not they are only about 1/2 inch tall...

one good thing I really like the compact box they came in with the lid that slides in so you don't lose your blocks.",3.0
"I think the blocks are very nice but they are not as described. The description say ""Complete alphabet, numbers 0-9 and stylized objects including animals, fruit, flowers and toys on big, sturdy 1.75-inch blocks"".  There are no numbers or stylized objects - just the alphabet. we bought them for both numbers and letters.",3.0
The tweezers were broken when we received this item.,3.0
The game is the classic version. But the quality is not great. The cards are printed very off center and some even have color where there shouldn't be color.,3.0
"I was just a little disappointed because the game was supposed to be new, but I ended up with a used version. The rubber band was missing (easily
replaced), the play money was in slightly rough condition, but still usable. The biggest problem is the two missing ""doctor"" cards. Guess I'll have to see if I can find replacements for them.",3.0
"Got this to go with a cash register, the bills were smaller than I expected.  But it serves the purpose.",3.0
"I bought these for my grandson and I guess the picture was a little deceiving, as I thought the blocks would of been bigger than the actually are.",3.0
"I did read other reviews of these blocks but needed them for an art project, not for a child. Besides the fact that some of the paint is chipping off the blocks without even using them the way a child would, the sides of some are very uneven and therefore when attempting to stack them, they fall over. I DID think the packaging was nice, and for the price, they're actually a pretty good deal.
Seems like alphabet blocks are a semi-thing of the past at this point in time. Perhaps blocks are difficult to find because computer learning has taken over. If you're looking for larger size blocks, as these are, these are about your only choice.",3.0
"I miss the old 1984 version. Not sure why they added so many more characters. I also hate that it's not Queen Frostine but ""Princess Frostine"" and they made her all ""sexy"" looking.",3.0
Bought this for a gift.  My grandaughter likes it!,3.0
A classic game that never goes out of fashion. Bought for my Grand-Daughter who enjoys it all the time. Good purchase !,3.0
"My daughter, she loves these blocks.  I have discovered that i hate these blocks.  I was in the process of picking them up and stepped back over one, and it put a hole the size of a dime in my foot.  So we've put them up till shes a bit older, I wish they were a bit bigger, but i can deal with the size, its the sharp edges that i dislike.  So we love these blocks, in the closet where big people won't step on them, at least for another year i think.  Oh, and my daughter got them for a first birthday present, and the size worked perfectly well with her.",3.0
just the right size for tiny little girl hands right now but awfully small to try to stack and build.,3.0
good for three & four year olds.,3.0
"My kids love this thing.  It's priced well and works...er, sort of.  I recommend it.  However, it does jam easily if your kids shake it or move it clumsily.  I believe the change gets stuck in the mechanism.

There are two fixes for this: super easy and fairly easy.

Super Easy Fix:
1. shake the register to try to dislodge whatever is jamming the tray.
2. if this doesn't work move to ""fairly easy fix"" below.

Fairly Easy Fix:
The fix took about 5 minutes.  You'll need a small Phillips head screwdriver.
1. At base Remove 4 visible screws.
2. Here's the only ""trick"" -  At base remove round rubber cover over the 4 corner stub supports.  These rubber covers you'll have to pull off and probably ruin (they are a cheap adhesive rubber).  It makes no difference.  Under this cover are four more screws.  Remove these.
3. Carefully separate top from base and remove change.  (There are a few wires attaching the two sides, so don't pull too hard.  These wires are for the calculator mechanism which my kids don't really use anyway.)
4. If spring comes off of tray replace.  There is a tab you have to slip the rounded end of the spring over.
5. Reassemble.

If you don't know the difference between a Phillips head screwdriver and a flat head screwdriver, the ""fairly easy"" fix may take you 15 minutes.",3.0
"I am giving this three stars because it has at least one typo. I pulled out a block with a picture of an elephant which was labeled ""elerhant."" I checked the others in the row and they were identical. I only bought these to use for a photo shoot so it's not a big deal to me, but I think parents and others buying this should be aware. Educational toys should not have errors.",3.0
"My daughter loved playing with these blocks. They're good to stack, or put in and out of the box. My only issue is that they are very sharp if you happen to step on one and sliced my foot open. But just sitting down playing with them was totally fine.",3.0
"These are a LOT smaller than I thought they would be. They are only about 1 inch by 1 inch. My son likes them, but quickly gets bored. Because they are so small, they are not very easy for a baby to stack and play with. The upside is that they are small enough that he can easily grab and hold them.",3.0
"While I really enjoy the fact that these blocks are old-school, non-battery operated treasures for my 12-month old, my set came with typos! ""Elephant"" is spelled incorrectly on every block that features the word. It's spelled ""ELERHANT."" It's not a deal breaker, but it was disappointing to discover. I would have returned them if they weren't so inexpensive. I'll just take the glass-half-full approach and use it as a teachable moment when my daughter is older :-) Also, they smell super-""painty"" and ""woody."" I can't deny the fact that I don't really allow my little one to put them in her mouth because I don't want her ingesting any of the paint that she'd be able to scape off with her teeth.",3.0
"These blocks were overall everything that was stated in the listing.  I maybe should have looked at the finer print because the blocks were much smaller than I was expecting.  I would not recommend these for any kids younger than 3 yrs, as my 22 month old daughter is still at an age where she could hurt herself or someone else with the blocks.  The corners are sort of on the sharper, pointier side, and I would rather they were not quite that sharp.  The price is not bad but I do know you can find some better choices at some of the chain stores for about the same price, $10, give or take a few dollars.",3.0
"I bought this toy for my 17 month old cousin. She only likes the animal figures, and she like throwing them. I was expecting them to be bigger since I wanted them so my little cousin could stack them on top of each other, but they're too small. I wouldn't recommend it too much.",3.0
I thought it was supposed to buzz as well as vibrate when you hit the side. But it just has a weird vibration and isn't as sensitive as it should be (as I remember).,3.0
The instructions  included in our game skip a sequence so we had to go on line to find the proper way to play this game.  It is fun but this game has been around for many years and they should have the instructions figured out by now.,3.0
Didn't like the packaging.  Box too big and not enough packing to keep it from moving all over the box.  Haven't opened it yet - gift for grandson who I haven't given it to yet,3.0
"While I appreciate the fact that this cash register takes cash and credit cards, I think it's missing a major feature. There are a lot (A LOT!) of people out there on Food Stamps and other assistance. This item needs to account for that by having a feature on it that scans EBT and SNAP cards and alerts the customer of her remaining balance and whether or not her purchases qualify (like no cigs, dog food, deli items, etc. for instance). Every time I'm in the store, I have the food stamp users in front of me, so I think this toy needs to run the full spectrum of possible checker scenarios in order to be considered ""realistic and educational"".",3.0
"I received the one pictured her - with the ""Brain Freeze"" item.  I liked it, however the buzzer in mine doesn't work.  So although I really dig the fact that this is as ""old school"" cool and fun as I remember from my childhood, I wish my buzzer worked.  It'd be more ""proof"" to my little kids when they touch the sides, and have to ""let the specialist take over""!

All-in-all, it is a fun game, requires 2x AA batteries, and is a true ""blast from your past"" game.",3.0
"I remember loving this when I was a kid. Got it for my daughter and have played a couple of times with the family, but quite frankly, it is BORING. And the board is a lot smaller and weirder than I remember. But you know kids, they love even the thought of candy, so it's popular with them. But SO boring. Don't buy it as a family game - get it for your kids to play with each other if you must.",3.0
"This is the version with the cards, like the game was originally made with. The only issues I have are that the updated game board makes the game longer than so the littlest players lose interest before the end and the smaller squares are a bit difficult for the younger crowd to actually aim and get their piece on. If I could find an old game board somewhere, I would use it until the kid is a bit older with better fine motor skills.",3.0
This is an old game & my 5 year old grandson doesn't  like it,3.0
"I was hoping for the classic candy land game, (like what I remember when I was a kid) but this is okay otherwise.",3.0
"It is pretty boring for an adult, and does not interest a four year old.  Maybe when he is five?",3.0
"This game is nothing like the one I had when I was younger. The board, cards, and pieces are made cheap, the characters are all different than before and are just plain average looking, nothing exciting here.",3.0
"My grand daughter wanted this so I got it for her, she loves it but have a hard time in getting her grand mother to play.",3.0
"My 3 yo couldn't find a square to move her piece since the board was so busy.  Cards were thrown everywhere.  We gave it away.  She's now 4 and she gets it.  It is rated for too young of a child.

Try the newer ed9ition with the spinner.",3.0
"The commercial makes it look so exciting, and kids WILL have fun with this game. However, be prepared to have an adult to supervise, the construction of the trap, and direct gameplay (which can be frustratingly long for younger children). Sadly, this game won't stand up to too much punishment, many small and often vital pieces are easily broken rendering the whole game useless. Having been around for so long it's getting pretty stale as well, and offers zip in the way of education - except taking turns, and fair play. Not for younger kids, and probably OK for the 7-10 range, but they probably want a computer ! It's probably time the makers of this game visited the year 2000",3.0
Great grand children enjoyed the gift.,3.0
"I was a little disappointed with the cheap construction of this toy.  Plastic seems a bit thin.  Not sure how long it will last in our house.
The drawer opens very roughly and the coins often spill out.  The drawer sticks too so my daughter gets a little frustrated.

Also, it is not entirely solar powered.  Just the calculator is.  The beeping noises require a battery.",3.0
"Bought this for my son's 4th bday.  He likes to play with one at school that looks more like an old time stand up register. Basically this one is a large solar calculator with a cash drawer.  We thought he'd go nuts over it, but its clearly ""that gift"" that isn't getting played with. Maybe he will in the future.",3.0
The pieces are not aligned with the board properly,3.0
"I choose this item for my 5 yr. old grandson who lives in Arizona.  I thought it would be the old fashion markers of ""Bears"".  I was disappointed that it was not,  but he wasn't because he does not know any different.",3.0
"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this toy!  There are just a few issues:
1.)  Agree with other reviewers, the drawer opens with too much force and all the coins go flying.
2.)  The ""off"" button turns the toy on and the ""on"" button turns it off...so much for educating the kids on words and actions.

I considered returning it due to the switched buttons, but I don't think we could be without the toy now that my son has it!  He loves to have us ""go shopping"" and buy stuff from him!

Great toy-one of his favorites so far (ranks right up there with Thomas.)",3.0
The game box was damaged.,3.0
Complicated rules for younger kids! My grandson just plays with the trap! He likes setting it up and taking it down and trapping the mice!,3.0
"I was so excited to buy Candy Land for my 3 year old daughter as her first board game. The dynamics of the game haven't changed but the board design actually makes game play annoying.
The squares are now bubblish and small, and there are A TON OF THEM. Because the path loops close together it's easy for her to forget which way she was moving. EVERY SINGLE AREA of the board is covered in sweets, which just leaves you dizzy and confused. It's like a Where's Waldo to find the pathway.
Despite that, it's still Candy Land and my daughter caught on quickly. Definitely purchase it, but honestly if you find an original Candy Land lying around make sure to nab the board.",3.0
"Pieces do not work or fit together properly, which is the main point of the game play.... very disappointing for my children!! They don't make it like when I was a child!!",3.0
"My 4yr old son wanted this cash register for Christmas.  We purchased it on Amazon and were really looking forward to giving it to him.  When he opened it on Christmas morning not one of the number buttons worked.  We contacted Amazon and they quickly sent us a new one.  Unfortunatly, on the new one the drawer is VERY hard to close (unlike the first one which was easy).  Despite the problems he loves his cash register and plays with it every day.  I just wonder how well it will stand up.",3.0
The fun of this game is to assemble and observe how it works the system to catch mice. play with the dice and the Board is very boring.,3.0
Fun game to play at least once or twice but doesn't lend it self to much repeat play with older kids.  However It is fun to play with the mouse trap pieces for a few times.  Instructions are as complicated as the mouse trap but generally straight forward.  Although game is for 2-4 people we successfully played it with 5 by adding an extra piece.  Game is definitely  more fun when players  that have mixed level of mechanical ability.  Game relies on  functional assembly of the trap and  malfunctions add some excitement to game play.  It is not a game to just hand over to small kids as there are many small parts.  It is better to have an older game runner (adult or teen) that can interpret the rules and instructions when playing with younger children.,3.0
"I recently purchased this toy for my three and five year old children.  It worked well the first day.  On the second day my five year old told me the numbers were not working and the screen remained on 0.  I arranged for an exchange through Amazon and am awaiting the replacement.  Today I noticed another reviewer had a similar problem, so it would appear this may be a manufacturing issue.  I will keep tabs on this toy's performance to be sure the replacement works.  It is a shame, because it is a terrific, fun, and educational toy for children in this age group.",3.0
"I've had my eye on this educational toy for some time and finally purchased it for my children as a Christmas gift.  It has had just three months of use and already three of the buttons don't work, including the ""equals"" button.  Without those buttons the toy is useless for educational purposes, and it is frustrating for my five year old who wants to add sums and such.  There have been so many good reviews for this product that I must conclude that I just got a dud, but it is no less disappointing.",3.0
"Loved Candyland as a kid, and was so glad to be able to buy it for my own daughter.  Unfortunately, I really do not like the graphics they use now compared to the original.  Otherwise, the game is still classic fun and enjoyable for the kids.",3.0
"This is a very good cash register and it is durable but I noticed after a time that the money smelled like poop, I think it has something to do with the electronics in the register, I've tried putting dryer sheets in the drawer but than it just smelled like downey poops, I've cleaned it too but nothing seems to work. And no my son didn't do anything to cause this odor. Finally I threw the money away and bought him the McDonald register which came with food, a headset, and McDonalds visor, he plays with this much more than the old one and it works just as good. I also purchased a jar of money that I think Amazon sells, it's cash, change and a check book w/ pen, very cute.",3.0
gifted to grandchild. the boot movement doesn't work smoothly.,3.0
"Cute, but a LOT of set-up required and too many pieces for use in my special ed classroom.",3.0
Cheap plastic pieces break easily.,3.0
"I don't understand why companies try to fix things that aren't broken.  Now the board is so ""busy"" it's annoying to look at, and it's not even cute.  There is a vintage version sold in a tin out there that I found after I purchased this one.  So this one is going to Granny's house!!!",3.0
I got this as a gift for my 4 & 6 year old sons. They were not very interested.,3.0
"I remembered this game from childhood, but I remember it being much more exciting than this game really is. Most of the game is ""building"" the trap, which is rolling a dice and adding a piece, which is quite mundane. Some of the pieces came out of the box bent, as if they had been jammed into the box.  If certain pieces aren't perfectly straight, the trap will not really trip, completely defeating the game. Also, it would be nice if there were at least one extra ball, because of course after one day my children promptly lost one, and the game won't work without it. I don't want to count that aginst the game since it's not the game's fault the pieces are lost. Nevertheless, the game takes a long time to reach its climax and my children (and I) lost attention before we ever even got to the famed cheese wheel. I'm kind of bummed we spent money on this, but not bummed enough to return it... so... three stars.",3.0
"This board, along with our copy of Chutes and Ladders, is really difficult to play. Our son is a typical 4 year old but he has a hard time staying focused when we play this game. There is way too much stimulus from the bright pictures that fill up the entire board. The spaces are too close together and the gingerbread men don't fit. I hope I can find an older version of the game because while I love the concept of Candyland, this one is just too hard for us to play.",3.0
"It's a fine game, nice quality. The set up is torture for parent's. don't buy this game. Don't do it. Turn off your computer and go to sleep. Just stop it....",3.0
"If you can afford to keep re-buying this because of all the little pieces that go missing, go for it! Every little girl loves this game :)",3.0
"I wish I could find any of the earlier, less cluttered, better-designed, Candyland boards.  In fact, I ordered 2 from Amazon that clearly displayed earlier versions and in both cases the seller sent me the latest one. You can't trust the product picture or seller's description as ""collectable"" on this site.",3.0
"Classic version but a lot less noise than I remember (not necessary a bad thing)

Pieces are much the same as I remember form 35 years or more ago. But small differences are not necessarily improvements.",3.0
"My 4 year old begged for Operation for Christmas and I wanted the classic version, didn't like the look and items in the newer versions. However it's way too difficult for her, hard for even the adults and she is disappointed. May have to get a character version after all with larger object openings.",3.0
"I got this game to teach my daughter how to play games. She didn't see any incentive to keep playing the game when you just move and then someone else moves, then again and again and again. She was totally bored and wanted to play with something else. It's pretty atypical of her too, because she loves matching games and the like....",3.0
"I played this game as I kid and so I bought it for my kid. Played once and wondered ""why did I want this?"" It's not a bad game, just, well, pretty much a one-off or nothing-better-to-do game. My son, who plays his games repeatedly, hasn't asked to play this again, and he's six. The actual parts went together sort of well, but were really touchy, and one part didn't work at all the way it was supposed to. It didn't matter how it was set up or fiddled with: it just didn't work right.

Maybe if you make up your own rules or something to add to it, it would be more fun, but really, I kind of wish I hadn't bothered to get it. Nostalgia bites sometimes.",3.0
"I loved it when I was a child, but my 5 years old doesn't like it too much.he played with it just twice and that's it. Maybe he is too little for this game.",3.0
"This product is tons of fun!  The only problem is some children aren't that fun.  My kid, the one I bought this friend generator for, isn't responding at all.  Everytime I set up a play date for Steve and his friends, he ends up forcing at least one of the losers to eat the candyland pieces.  There is a limited amount of cardboard, thankfully, so these things will all end once the neighborhood toddler population has consumed the playing field.  If your kid is normal, I'd buy this.",3.0
I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter.  She got impatient having to wait to build the trap but once we got it all done she had a ball just playing with it as a toy instead of a game.,3.0
A fun family game classic but...it is sometimes a little difficult to assemble and keep assembled properly. It is overall a fun game to play with the kids and one that my husband and I enjoy just as much as the kids do!,3.0
"The game shown in the picture is not the game you get. The graphics have been totally redone. Maybe I just don't like change, but I was very disappointed when I opened the box and set it up. Will toy manufacturers ever understand that when parents purchase a classic like this, that they themselves played as kids, they want it too look similar to what they played with as kids? Even my 9 year old was disappointed when, after sitting down to play with his 3 year old sister, he realized that there was no Peppermint Forest, no Rainbow Trail, no Gramma Nut, no Jolly or Plumpy, and the fairy princess Frostine has been replaced by Moxie Girl wannabee. The new graphics are garish and distract from the classic simplicity of the game. There is really not a bare space on the board.

That said, my 3 year old enjoys it and it is helping me teach her to take turns, be a polite winner and a graceful loser.",3.0
"The good of the Candyland game is that it's simple and my daughter has played since she was two.  The bad part is that it doesn't teach anything other than the very basics of board games.  There is absolutely no skill used.  Once you shuffle the cards the game is decided.  You pick cards one by one and move accordingly.  The kids cannot learn any real strategy at all.

If your child is over 3 or 4 and has the basic understanding of what a game is, then I'd say skip Candyland.  There is little point to a game that is decided at the first card.  But for the very young it's worth having around so they can learn what game boards look like, pieces, cards, and feel the joy of winning...and losing.  But I'm very glad to see my daughter grow past this game.  Very.",3.0
"This game is a lot of fun; however..... it is a pain to set up.  My children are 5 and 8 and they cannot set it up.  It actually takes us (adults) a little while to get it right.  So, needless to say, if it does not stay set up then it is not played with. Keeping it set up is a difficult task because it gets bumped while they are playing in the bedroom.  I gave it a lower rating because, for us, it was a complete waste of money.  I actually trashed it last week.",3.0
"Though I don't like the new style of candy land, mainly because I don't like change, the kids love it.  Our 4yo has been able to learn his colors from it and it helps with counting as well.  It may be a little long for a 4yo though but if you help them along they will do fun.  Of course all that candy really keeps them mesmerized.",3.0
I don't remember this being made so cheaply. Works though.,3.0
"the good:
My four year old loves this game so much that he'll play it by himself. It's very easy to understand, and the winner is decided by completely random luck. The board, markers, and cards are durable and cute. The instructions include a variation where players draw 2 cards at a time, and must decide which card to play (teaches kids to consider 2 options and choose the more advantageous one).

the bad:
It's boring for adults, as it requires no skill. My family also likes Guess Who?, which can be played by non-reading younger kids but requires some thinking to win. Memory is another game for non-readers which can be enjoyed by players of all ages.",3.0
"The game is more fun when I was a child.  The contraption is still cool and the best part of the game.  You just want to see the contraption go over and over again.  The game itself is dull until the end where it becomes a fun bit of russian roullette.  If you are playing this with a young child, just supervise while they put it together and take it apart.  I already had to buy a spare part off ebay 2 weeks into owning this game,",3.0
I bought this for my 8 year old.  Took us adults 3 hours to get it together... and then wasn't as fun as I remembered from when I was a kid,3.0
We purchased this for adults as a childhood remembrance.  Very disappointing as far as playing the game.  Difficult for younger kids to grasp the game concept so they just play with the parts.,3.0
"It is ok, very, very hard to get the whole thing to work right,",3.0
Challenging to keep together,3.0
"Like all games nowadays, flimsy plastic.  But it works",3.0
There are a few problems with getting all the parts to stand up correctly.  I had this game myself years ago.  Too bad they haven't improved on the quality.,3.0
"This classic game was played by myself and my brothers as our first experience with board game playing and it is also my son's first experience with playing board games as well.  We began playing Candyland when he was 2 years old and knew his colors well enough.  It teaches colors and matching, obviously, but it allows for the parent to teach valuable concepts like taking turns, not being a sore loser, playing by the rules, and other good social skills involved in game play with others.  That said, I was so disappointed with the quality of the game itself.  The board is OK (although I wish the spaces were large enough to accomadate the gingerbread men pawns that are supposed to fit on the spaces).  But the cards are very flimsy.  All of our cards are bent up and some are torn.  All are dirty.  I realize that the price of this game is quite inexpensive and is still a good value for the price.  But I wish they had an alternative Candyland game that cost more and was more durable to withstand play for all my child's toddler and preschool years.  An ideal game would have a larger board with larger spaces and sturdy (maybe chipboard) cards that are laminated.  A plastic ""draw-discard"" container would also be nice to contain all of the cards during play to get children use to that concept of card play.  I would gladly pay more for a more durable version of this wonderful game",3.0
Fun game to play but the set up is complicated that my 6 year old won't play be himself.,3.0
Product as advertised.  It is ok but look for the newer models that the kids will enjoy more.,3.0
"Meh - someone told me their kids loved this...it's a pain to set up, complicated (too much so for my kids), and flimsy. I would have passed...maybe better for 10+",3.0

"Part of the fun when I was the kids was the ""shocking"" buzzer.  It has been replaced with a kinder, gentler buzzer.  My kids don't the that fun and get easily frustrated cause they cant get out the body parts.  It was much funner when not getting the body part out meant you got that ""shocking"" buzzer sound.",3.0
"Operation has been around for generations. First made by Milton Bradley Company, it was later being manufactured by Hasbro, Inc. as were many other toys originally designed by Milton Bradley Company. If you don't believe me about it being around for generations, well it first arrived in toy stores in the mid 1950's and has been going strong ever since. There's just something about this strange little board game that appeals to most children.

The ""board"" is an electronic device that resembles a patient on an operating table. This is all run on batteries. The patient has open spaces in his body to show ""body parts"" - ok so it's not really body parts, but more like a spoof on the body parts.

The object of the game is to be paid for removing ""ailments"" from the patient and when all the ""ailments"" or body parts are removed, then the doctor with the most money wins. Sounds simple, right? It can be difficult to remove these considering you're given a pair of tweezers and you have to take out the body part without touching the sides of the area containing the body part. If you do, you'll set off a buzzer that has a very obnoxious sound and the patient's red nose lights up. I'm not sure what the nose is about, but it is fun to watch his nose light up like Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer!

Just how do the players determine what ""ailment"" to remove? You have to draw a card and it will tell you which one gets to be taken out. You have ""specialist"" cards that have you remove things like the Adams apple, ankle bone, bread basket (that actually looks like a slice of bread), spare ribs, writers cramps, charlie horse, water on the knee, wish bone, funny bone, butterflies in the stomach (yes, these too look like butterflies), wrenched ankle (can you guess what this looks like?), and broken heart (complete with a crack in the heart).

Some of the body parts are easy to remove (the bread basket and broken heart), but others are much more difficult (there is even one part that has a rubber band that holds the pieces together).

Although this game is fun to play and takes a tad bit of skill, there are several negative aspects to it. This is definitely trying for very young children and if they keep trying to remove body parts, the buzzer can be annoying and frustrating. Constant encouragement is needed until they can master the use of the tweezers. The biggest problem I've encountered is the loss of body parts. Since these pieces are small, they are easily lost. Once enough body parts are lost, the game is useless and you either have to try and find replacement pieces or throw the game away.

I'd recommend Operation for children under eight years old and can be a fun addition to family game night. Younger children may become too frustrated when trying to play, especially with older children playing too. One thing that seemed to work for us was to keep the playing pieces in a Ziplock baggie so they couldn't get lost easily.

So, don your scrubs and get ready to play doctor - you'll have a great time as long as the buzzer remains silent!",3.0
"Another game that I find it amazing that is made available in this hi-tech age we live in. As a kid, I thought this game was okay. Purpose is to remove these tiny plastic parts from the operating board. Comes with twelve parts that's to be 'professionally' removed with a pair of tweezers. Don't lose the parts and this game should last awhile. Anyone else remember the TV ad for this game way back when as the girl in pigtails reads off the instructions on the card, ""Take out wrenched ankle...""? That commercial may have done more damage than Milton Bradley knows. Requires two size AA batteries.",3.0
"This toy is frustrating. We got it for our boy and it's nearly impossible. The ""tweezers"" it comes with make it totally impossible to pick up certain pieces. They need a little bit of rubber grip on the end or something. On top of that the pieces slip into oblivion within thier designated area making it impossible to dig them out. This gives me flahsbacks to when I used to play the game when I was a child. I remember the same problems. This leads me to believe that MB needs to update this toy slightly. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. Just in need of a little refurbishing. Btw, my kid still loves it and plays with it....it's just that the real playing of the game is pointless due to it's glitches.",3.0
"This scared me to death when it buzzed! DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE HEART ATTACK EASILY!!!!! WARNING!!!!!

Get earplugs before playing! Horrible for children under 5! When I was 5, I cried when I played it! It buzzes way to much and is way to hard. And be very carful! The pieces get stuck under the slots. I am 10 now and I still get scared when I play it!",3.0
Still a super pain the rear to put and keep together.,3.0
This seemed to lose its allure pretty quickly with the kids.,3.0
Love the game. Did say that the box was beaten up but didn't say some of the pieces were broken!!!,3.0
"I understand it's a cheap game, but geez, very cheaply made! I don't remember games and toys breaking quite so easily when I was a kid.",3.0
"We originally purchased this toy for our young daughter.  We thought she'd have a good time and improve her manual dexterity.  What we didn't forsee was that the games buzzer would scare the bejesus out of her every time it went off.  It very quickly proved too stressful for her to use.  She'd go to tears just worrying about the buzzer. (She has since gone on through college with a Mathmatics degree and a Masters Degree and is happily married in case you were thinking she is some sort of simpleton.)
Anyway, it might be fun for 10 year olds, but I'd think twice about anything much younger.",3.0
The quality is not what it use to be. I have to help the kids each time they play. Prices don't fit right. It is too hard for the kids to put together. I'd not recommend unless you want to play mouse trap every time the kids play. However the kids love it and we have fun,3.0
"I always wanted this game when I was growing up, so I was excited when I saw it at a yard sale recently.  I paid $1 for it.  I was surprised when I saw it was $20 on here.  I'm glad I didn't spend that much, because, although my daughter loves the game, it is a pain in the neck to get everything set up just right only to have it not work all the way through.  That hand thing doesn't work at all.  We were missing a rubber band for the stop sign kicker, so I had to find one that would work.  (No, too tight; no, too big; etc.)  The diving man doesn't always do a 10-rating back flip and the cage comes down at the slightest jiggle.  So, disappointing for me, but, like I said, my 4-year-old daughter loves it.  She tried to put it together herself, but needed help from me.  She is happily playing with it now and hopefully learning mechanics and cause/effect.  She has the red mouse in the bucket.  Not sure what's up with that!",3.0
"I remember playing this game as a child and it is lots of fun,but, because of the cheap plastic parts it doesn't even work properly. The mouse trap is so flimsy ! Look for a vintage game !",3.0

I would make sure your smaller kids are supervised when using this as the tweezers are sharp and the game pieces are small.",3.0
"Fun to put together the mouse trap but the game part is kind of confusing. Better to just get a marble run kit, but I was lured by the nostalgia of mousetrap.",3.0
Takes more time to assembly each time you want to play with it than anticipated; however the grand kids love it.,3.0
"Amazing, but in a sealed box, new game, the 52 cheese pieces were omitted...no sign of them.  So the 5 grandkids were pretty disappointed, but they settled on a standard deck of cards ;-)

Called Hasbro and they promise to mail the pieces.  We will see.  Not sure customer service rep understood what was missing.",3.0
"So, we set this all up and tried to get the whole contraption to do what it's supposed to do.  I don't know what is going on, but things are not working very well.  Some of the parts are not connecting the way they should.  Yes, I followed the directions, everything is where it's supposed to be.  When we do get it to work my kids just love watching the man jump into the bucket.  That is their favorite part!",3.0
Recipients are trying to play the game and have discovered there is no lamp stand. How can I get the lamp stand if it was not included?,3.0
"This game is a lot of fun, but certainly requires adult assistance for younger players. The pieces can be difficult to fit into the board or setup for little hands.",3.0
I had this game as a kid.  My kids love it but the pieces are really flimsy and easy to break.,3.0
"I don't remember mousetrap being so laborious when I was a kid! I'm sure it's the same game now as it was 20 years ago, but parents be warned: you will be sitting through hours of complicated board setup (which require reading skills). My son loves it, but I have to admit I try to avoid it unless I am absolutely finished with all of my other daily duties and can afford to commit the time it takes to complete the game.",3.0
Setting it up was little hard. The plastic hand part does not seem to be doing it's job correctly. I would not buy this game.,3.0
"Game came quick and new in plastic. We finally opened it and played. Mousetrap is a lot of work with a 4 year old, but worth that moment of truth where the trap falls on the mouse. We were finally there and.....what happened!! One of the plastic attachments necessary to make the trap fall was broken. :(  O well, we were able to replace it with a part from our old mousetrap game so we didn't have to go through the hassle of returning through the mail. I'm sure this isn't a routine thing, at least i hope it isn't. we just happened to get one with a broken part. Other than that its the same old game of mousetrap we have been playing for years!",3.0
What can i say about this cool game.  First im gonna say im 31 yrs old and still play this game.  I live alone and set it up and just enjoy tinkering with it.  Its awesome.  When family does come to the house we play this game for hours on end.  Much better then tv.  It teaches kids simple mechanics of how turning a simple hand crank can have a chain reaction of things.  The hardest part of the game is actually getting the cage to fall down the plastic pole without getting hung up.,3.0
had this game as a kid. never got it to work right today got it to work three times in s roe,3.0
"I TOTALLY agree with everyone that says the plastic parts are flimsy!
I HATE the cardboard cheese pieces! WHY couldn't they have made them out of plastic?????
Also GOOFY illustrations on the board! HATE the new graphics!
I am going to contact Hasbro and ask them WHY can't they make a reproduction edtion of Mousetrap because they have reproductions of Monopoly,Clue and other games so why not this one?????
I will also tell them what POOR quality this game is and how frustrating it is for an adult to have to put together to make the cheap plastic try & work...and DON'T even think a child could do it! My son asks for help EVERY time we play this game because he CAN'T make pieces stay together to work(such as turning the handle on the gears even bends!)
Our lamp-post is broken and even super glue will NOT hold it!
I remember the older version in the 60's & 70's...MUCH BETTER QUALITY!
I am fixing to see if I can find a older version that isn't junk...
SO dissappointing to see a child who actually loves the concept of the game but gets frustrated and sad when it takes forever to assemble then doesn't work half the time!",3.0
"This game has been fun for our 7 year-old.  She has enjoyed building it and playing the game.

I'm dissapointed as a parent with the quality.  Toys in general just don't seem to be made like they used to.  The sections slid around once they were attached to the gameboard which made the end of the game pretty dissapointing because the trap wouldn't always fall.  But the kids do like it and it was a fun trip down memory lane for my wife and I.",3.0
They sure don't make things as durable as they used to!  We owned this game as kids and bought it for our son last Christmas.  The game hasn't changed much but it's construction has.  The parts are cheap and don't fit into the board well and as you're playing it can take a couple of tries to make everything work in sync.,3.0
"We love all types of board games...but I avoid this one in the game closet at our house. I wish it were easier to get the game started; and likewise to break it down completely and put it away. I think I'm either going to ""hide"" it or re-gift it. haha. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the kids DO enjoy playing once it is set up. But since they are 4 & 7, they need a little help putting it together. It has to be set up *just* right or the whole game is off. Not my favorite. :o",3.0
"The idea of this game is good....take turns building the mouse trap and trap a mouse at the end. But, despite the # of years this game has been around, I think it needs to be overhauled! The pieces must link together securely for the ball to follow a path that will eventually capture a mouse. But I had to use some sticky mount to get the pieces to fit into the holes on the board and stay put. My kids had fun after I put it together and just rolled the ball through the contraption.",3.0
"Several other reviewers have commented that Mousetrap is all about the contraption: I agree.  The contraption has a certain charm, if you can tolerate the frustration of occasions when it just won't work.  But playing it as a game holds little interest; instead, I,  with some help from the kids, put the contraption together, and then the kids try triggering it off (lots!) of times -- then we're done.  Whether you really like Mousetrap, or despise it, will probably depend on whether the Rube Goldberg aspect of the Mousetrap charms you or leaves you cold, and whether you enjoy putting all the pieces together (and then the suspense of whether or not you can actually get it working that day).

For a similar-in-spirit contraption incorporated into a much better playing game, take a look at the Ratatouille Kitchen Quake game,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DISNEY-PIXAR-RATATOUILLE-KITCHEN-QUAKE-GAME/dp/B000NIGS9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DISNEY PIXAR RATATOUILLE KITCHEN QUAKE GAME</a>.

Mousetrap (M) vs. Ratatouille (R)

Contraption theme
M:  Nostalgic (for those of us who grew up with it); wild Rube Goldberg variety of parts.
R: Limited to kitchen utensils, to fit in well with Ratatouille movie.

Contraption number of individual parts:
M: about 25
R: about 15
Note that the contraptions have the same sort of underlying structure; the difference is that in Mousetrap things like ""bases"" are constructed from lots of separate parts, where the analogous piece in Ratatouille would have an integral base.  So the overall contraption in Ratatouille doesn't really seem less complex or interesting -- but the construction has fewer pieces/is simpler.

Stage when construction of contraption occurs:
M: During the game (if you actually play the game, which we almost never do, but instead merely build and play with the contraption).
R: As part of game setup, before the game itself.

Reliable operation of contraption:
M: This can be frustrating...
R: Fewer pieces, which fit into plastic mounts in the game board, seems to give better reliability.  To retain the ""charm"" of uncertainty of operation, Ratatouille actually has two initial trigger buttons: a reliable button used when triggering ingredient launches, and an unreliable button used when triggering the contraption to (possibly) whack opponent pawns off their current position on the playing board.

Playing pawn interaction with contraption:
M: Only at end-stage of game, when mice pawns get ""caught"" by the falling cage which is the last piece of the contraption.
R: Recurs throughout the game -- Remy pawns climb onto the contraption at two different points of the game path, putting them in danger of getting dislodged (and having to move backwards to penalty spaces) if the contraption gets triggered, and at various other game board positions Remy pawns are in danger of getting whacked out of position by contraption moving parts if the contraption gets triggered by an opponent.  And attempted triggering of the contraption (this is the unreliable button) happens a lot, both when any player passes Chef Skinner board squares, or when a player's attempt to collect an ingredient instead turns up Chef Skinner.  Also, Remy pawns collect and actually carry (between the little pawn paws, on top of the pawn head) ingredient disks which eventually are placed in the spoon launcher part of the contraption (and one hopes launched into the soup pot when the contraption is triggered).  (This increased interaction is one of my favorite improvements in Ratatouille over Mousetrap; as a kid, it was unsatisfactory to me that the Mousetrap mice pawns didn't have more of a role to play in contraption operation.)

Collection of cheese (M) vs. ingredients (R) aspect:
M: Not interesting.
R: Kind of fun: there's a ""memory game"" aspect to the collection of the ingredients.

End-game:
M: Once players get to the final loop, they're stuck there going around and around -- boring.
R: There's a ""launching ring"" to get a chance to launch your current ingredient, but then you set off around the whole board path again -- wheee!  First player to collect two ingredients and get them both launched into the soup pot wins.

What's fun:
M: Building the contraption (if such building is to your taste); operating the contraption (if it's not too frustrating).
R: Setting up the contraption (though this is somewhat simplified from Mousetrap); operating the contraption; playing the game.",3.0
"A major headache for adults, but my 5 year old daughter loves it!  My daughter got this game for Christmas and wants to play it again and again.  The pieces are very cheap plastic and I doubt it will stand up to very  many more games.  I'll continue to play it for the sake of my daughter, but I won't be disapointed when it's no longer useable.",3.0
"In this high-tech age, I am truly amazed a game like Mouse Trap is even still made anymore. Don't get me wrong - for I liked this game very much as a kid - well over thirty years ago. I recently purchased this game and I (found out) the hard way that most kids over the age of eight years old - likely wouldn't have much interest in it. The recommended age is over three. So that would narrow it down to ages 3 to 7. If you're an adult with some time on your hands, you could possibly find this -classic- game somewhat entertaining for a short time - while you're waiting to do something else. Only downside of Mouse Trap is that there are too many required pieces that can (easily) end up misplaced or broken. Overall, it's an okay game.",3.0
"The game is OK...The object of game is to trap the opponents mouse. But here is the catch...you have to go around the board and bulid the trap first. The pieces, although very colorful..are not color coded...so this can be a bit confusing. For each piece of the trap that you build...you get a piece of cheese...throughout play you can steal cheese from your opponent, or pay pieces of cheese to set your opponent up to get trapped! Cute game...they say to get rid of all bags that the game pieces come in...there are a lot...but my advice is to replace those bags with Ziplocks and do it quickly!! Must have patience when playing this game...especially when putting it together!!!!",3.0
"As a child, I thought this game was SO fun:  probably because, my brother and I would just build the trap (or try to) and just play with the pieces like a toy.  I don't think we ever played the game for real.  My son received this game- unsolicited - for his fifth birthday.  He was elated, and I was too, at first.  This game -for an adult- is Torture!  Very slow moving, very repetitive, very boring and LONG.  Your children will probably think it is so fun- but be forewarned- you will not.  Unfortunately, young children will need your involvement to play- so you won't be getting off easily.  Hopefully, you'll be as lucky as I was.  You'll play it a few times, and a piece will break, rendering the game useless because it doesn't all fit together properly anymore!  ahhh, what a shame....",3.0
"I bought this game to play at family holidays. It just wasn't that fun to my family. Some of the proverbs were dumb and meaningless.  I also bought ""Wits and Wagers"" game at the same time. It was a riot! The whole family loved this game. I recommend Wits and Wagers over Wise and Otherwise.",3.0
"At a recent family gathering, I played my first game of ""Wise and Otherwise.""  I was told that it was similar to Balderdash, an accurate assessment.  Rather than making up creative definitions for unknown words as in Balderdash, Wise and Otherwise requires players to complete unfamiliar expressions from many different cultures around the world.  The first part of the expression is given on the card, and each player writes down their best guess as to how it might end.  Then, like Balderdash, players listen to all of the possible endings (including the correct one from the back of the card) and try to pick the right one.  Points are awarded for guessing correctly and also for each made-up answer that is selected by another player as the right one.

I prefer this game over Balderdash because it didn't seem as tiresome.  After just a few rounds of Balderdash, I'm tired of making up fake definitions.  But finishing expressions was actually a lot of fun, and because each expression lends itself to different possibilities, my creative juices didn't run dry so quickly.  I was also impressed that everyone (including a few elementary-aged kids) seemed to be able to offer reasonable responses, and the final score was quite competitive between all players.

Having acknowledged some strengths of the game, I just wasn't very engaged in the game, for reasons still somewhat unclear to me.  One thing that was disappointing to me was that some of the expressions made absolutely no sense.  I kept wondering about the origin and context of the expressions, but such information is not provided.  I really like to learn interesting information when I play games, and I felt like the lack of explanation left me unsatisfied.

I enjoyed the game and won't protest if an opportunity arises to play again sometime.  But the next time we're trying to decide what game to play, I'll probably suggest something else.",3.0
"hello people.

well, I played this game at the Caspian Sea in between tanning and eating hot dogs. It's great for multi-racial groups. I played with a half black/half mexican person, a chinese person, a texan, a jew, and an australian! and me, a north carolinian! buy this today!",3.0
"While the game itself is a great one, I bought it for one amount not knowing that when I finally got it the cost had doubled.  I thought when I ordered more than one item at a time, I was saving shipping costs but that certainly didn't work in this case.  I could have gone to the store, bought the game and paid less!",3.0
"Fun game, not the family favorite, but still fun.",3.0
Have no idea how to play this game - the directions don't make sense to us.,3.0
"I bought this thinking that it would help my developmentally delayed granddaughter with some basic skills as the game had won different awards.  We played it with her sister and grandmother.  While everyone was able to perform the functions, no one found it particularly fun or interesting.  I had also ordered Sleeping Queens not expecting much from it and we found it fun helpful for memory function and strategy.",3.0
My 4th graders didn't like it.,3.0
So so but purchased as daughter going through a cat phase. Game won awards but playing it is simply okay. We are a big board game family and are perhaps a bit jaded. Packaged neatly though.,3.0
Not very durable,3.0
good,3.0
This is missing some of the connective pieces but still works.,3.0
a little on the flimsy side,3.0
"This is a ""no peek"" game in which you try to lower the point value of your hand.  You originally get to look at two of your cards.  There are also some ""power"" card additions so you can ""peek"", ""swap"" or ""draw two""  You end the game when you ""think"" you have the lowest hand and then points are counted.  I played with grandchildren.  The six year old played two hands and then was disinterested.  The ten and twelve year olds only played the first hand.  They said they like Uno better.",3.0
My granddaughter hasn't played with it as much as she thought she would when she requested it at Christmas.,3.0
MY GRAND CHILDREN EXPLAINED TO ME THERE WERE TOO MANY PEACES AND THE INSTRUCTION WERE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND.  THEIR MOTHER HAD TO READ AND EXPLAIN EACH TIME THEY PLACED.,3.0
It broke in two days.  Bummer.,3.0
"Not a bad little toy, but there are others for less money out there, for sure.  This one has some pieces that broke after just a week of playing with it.  Although I know the kids can be a little rough on things, I expected it to last a bit longer than it did.",3.0
"I played it with my six year old grandson and found it a bit complicated about looking or not looking at your cards, etc.",3.0
This game was great until my daughter figured out how to see the numbers on the cards without using the filter which spoiled all the fun of the game.,3.0
Broke within 5 mins,3.0
"Rat-a-tat Cat is a cute game involving simple math computation, memory and simple strategy. My 5 1/2 year old grandson learned it quickly. I am disappointed by the poor quality of the cards. They are thin and tend to curl. I wonder if older editions came with better quality cards.",3.0
Weak glow effect.  Unimpressive.,3.0
Thought this would be made of more durable plastic then it was.  Prices were snapped off near hinges and not fixable.,3.0
"We are a pretty avid game playing family and were excited to try this game.  The description sounded right up our alley, but in reality, the game is pretty boring with only 4 people.  Our boys (8 and 6) seem to enjoy it much more than my husband and I; it seems to drag on for a bit.  I will say that we pulled it out when we had some friends over and playing with 7 made it much more difficult to achieve a low score, remember where cards were, etc. and thus provided a much better playing experience.",3.0
"this is exactly what I expected it to be in terms of a toy, however, it felt very light and I was afraid to let the kids play with it too much.  We have had it for a few weeks now, and it is still intact.  It definitely puts off a great glow.",3.0
"It's fun to play with, but the little plastic joint pieces keep popping off.  This was after the first use.  Kind of frustrating, and as a result, my daughter doesn't really want to play with it anymore.",3.0
"Fun game. Directions could be clearer about a couple of things:  1) Can players look at outside cards again or just once?  2) Once ""rat a tat cat"" is called, how do you score players if they are still holding a power card?  Also, when explaining how to use the ""scanner"" directions should indicate that the player should place them on the bridge of their nose for best viewing. With kids, the strong impulse is to look at other people's cards and to try to read the ""word"" without using the scanner so they understand their own hand better. This could all be spelled out in a more explicit way with kid-friendly guidance. I had fun with my family but had to really reinforce some things that were not spelled out in the directions.",3.0
The people we gave this game to like it better than Mummy Rummy but not as well as Loot.  Loot is hard to compete with in their opinion.,3.0
Good quality sturdy and a bit smaller then expected. Great colors.,3.0

"Does not open and collapse in the air like other Hoberman Spheres. Also, a piece broke off the first day.",3.0

If dropped can easily break. Cheap plastic.,3.0
It will serve its purpose for what I need which is to demonstrate a breathing technique in kids yoga but the one I received looks nothing like the one in the picture and seems to be a cheaper substitute. If I ever buy another one I will buy directly through the Hoberman company so I know exactly what I'll be recovering.,3.0
Its a little pricey for what it is seems like it will break easy. But happy with shipment it arrived on time and is as described.,3.0
"Five stars for entertainment and a great idea and concept.

I give it three stars for durability. After just a few months, it started to pop apart and break when the kids would toss it and grab it as kids do. I don't think I would call it rough play, but normal boys playing with a toy. Unless played on carpet alone, the edges started to get worn, and the plastic scraped.

A fun toy for sure, keeping interest over time, but not as durable as we would like.",3.0
Product was okay.,3.0
"This is a super cool toy that my kids love. I was a little disappointed how quickly some of the joints broke, but it still works, and I guess that's just to be expected with kids.",3.0

meets expectations and delivered on-time,3.0
"I thought it would be a little more sturdy.  This is one of those toys that is better to actually hold in their hand at a toy store before making a decision to buy than purchase online in my opinion.  Nothing against Amazon; it's just hard to tell the quality/construction from a photo.  My 4 year old has not broken it yet however, probably because it's only been played with a few times.

Some kids/adults might like this but it lost it's allure pretty quick and will most likely be in the next garage sale.  It sure looks neat though and is fun to open a close for a few minutes, just the thing to put on your desk next to your Newton's Cradle.",3.0
"Hard to know how to rte this product.  My little great-grandson absolutely loved it, but on Easter after he found it, he and his big sister started to use it as a ball to hit with a plastic bat.  They played for over an hour before a piece flew off.  Of course, he begged me to order another and I did.  It came yesterday--promptly.  I'm not sure what kind of advice to give him, but I also received a plastic bat and ball set--hopefully this will work for him.  He'll be 6 in June, and he is very, very active--a soccer player, etc.  His sister will be nine in June.  They play so well together, and they did a lot of Easter bonding with your product.  Surely, we'll have better luck with this one--at least knowingt what not to do!",3.0
"I use it a lot with the high school students I work with.  The red pieces have fallen off a number of times.  Also, some of the red pieces look like swastikas.",3.0
I thought I was going to receive the purple and green color in the picture but the item I received was multi-color. I needed it for Christmas so I didn't bother returning it but I was disappointed.,3.0
Some of the plastic pieces broke within a couple days.  Still usable.  Kids love it.,3.0
Doesn't open and close as smoothly as I thought.,3.0
"Really cool, but quite a bit ""looser"" than I assumed.  In other words, I thought it would be harder to collapse, and would stay formed if held, but it immediately collapses when touched. However, my sons are still enjoying it.",3.0
"These are very fragile and things started popping off after a few days, still works but not worth the price IMO.",3.0
I bought this to help teach slow deep breathing techniques to children.  I should have gotten the larger size as this was too small to be very effective in large groups.  It would work well with small groups and with individuals.,3.0
I have seen this product in person and I ordered it for my grandson who is 5yrs old. We tried to toss it and it actually is awkward and hurts when you catch it. I was disappointed as he does care to play with it now. The shipping and arrival was fine.,3.0
My children have had a couple of these before and have always loved them.  This one is no exception except that it does not close up as easily as it seems like it should.,3.0
"This is great fun I think I have more fun then my granddaughter, wish it would glow better. But I like it alot going to get one for my house",3.0
"Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. I actually bought two of them. My only issue is that some of the blue connectors came off after only a couple uses. Also, some of the arms of the ball became disconnected from each other. This was an easy fix as I just snapped those back into place. The blue connectors however, are unable to be reatteched leaving a couple arms free and not connected. Even with this happening, the Hoberman Sphere works just fine. My 1 1/2 yr old, 4 yr old, and 7 year old love these things. Recommend!",3.0
It works but when my four year old started playing with it had jammed up in about 10 minutes.  It's really for older folks.,3.0

"My daughter got this for Christmas and it has already broke. It was really fun when it worked, but the blue pieces on the ends started popping off. Was fun while it lasted.",3.0
"""Santa"" bought this for my 6 year old son for Christmas last year. It was his favorite toy! He found how it worked facinating for his young mind and the design and concept is inspiring as well as educational. It has very smooth motion as it expands and collapes..it glows brighter in the dark then I even imagined...and it breaks so very easily, with hardly any effort at all. My son didn't smash it, didn't drop it, didn't hit it...nothing. We had it for 2 days before suddenly, as he and I were playing with it, one of the little tiny plastic links that folds in and out as it explands just suddenly snagged or twisted wrong for no reason with another part and before we could even stop and see what had happened, the flimsy plastic piece just snapped right off. Just like that. The toy still worked, and I tried to glue it anyway, but the plastic is that funky kind that doesn't go well with crazy glue and the pieces are so small that I was afraid it would accidently glue the whole joint together..so we left it like that so he could still play with it. It just was a little stiff in that spot since it lost some support. The next day, as he played with it with his father this time, it happened again in another spot. Then again. And again. After 4 days total it was entirely unusable and I had to toss it out. I was so upset as was my son. It wasn't a lot of money to buy, but this was his favorite toy and to see it last less then a week (when handled very carefully too!) was just so disappointing. So please, DO NOT BUY THIS. Save your child the disappointment and find a better quality one made with metal or harder plastic from someone else. I sure with I had. :(",3.0
The mini sphere is not as good as the full size sphere. When fully expanded it seems to lock itself and you need special effort to make it small again...,3.0
"The Hoberman Sphere is a really cool toy.  My eight-year-old son loves it.  The problem is that it's too fragile for him.  If you have a child who is very careful with his toys or if you are buying this for yourself, then that may not be a problem. However, I would not recommend the Hoberman for typical kids who play normally with their toys.  The little plastic joints are thin and don't bend sufficiently when bounced or collided with heavier objects.  We got the Hoberman for Christmas and it broke apart in less than a week.  It still expands and contracts, but now has an entire section missing and really isn't safe to use.  There are little sharp pieces where the plastic has broken, so it scratches and pinches.  We won't be keeping it.  Again, I would say this is okay to purchase if you are keeping it on a shelf in your office and messing with it yourself, but it's not going to last if you give it to your kid.",3.0
I bought this for my 5-year old daughter. She really enjoyed using it and actually enjoyed the challenge of having to figure out the answers in the shortest time possible. The different levels of difficulty are useful so she can keep using it over the years.,3.0
Not recommend. Screen is too small and no backlights! Too many step before my kid can start doing the flascard. I wish it can be simpler,3.0
"I was so excited to get this for our son. He loves riding in it to no surprise, it really is a great toy, but the quality is going down. Older models I've seen at yard sales are better quality than this new one. Door won't stay shut properly and stickers come off after a few months even if used indoors only. I should have bought a used one someplace, I totally wasted money on shipping and now I am stuck with a car with no stickers. I am very disappointed, but yes, this toy is a great fun for all kids I know.",3.0
"My son lost interest right away, for what you pay its just not worth it.",3.0
"We bought this for our almost 2 year old. He loves it, which is why I was hoping it would be more durable. My husband had to drill some of the parts to make them fit together and the door will NOT stay on no matter what we do. It's fallen off probably no less than 30 times and he just got it this morning. The workmanship could be better, but other than that, it is a fun toy.",3.0
"My grandaughter wanted a ""go car"", she's 23 months old.  Amazon had the best price, and the delivery was great!  She loves it, and wants to go outside constantly to ""go car"".",3.0
The children like it because it's electronic. :) the old way of a timing them on a page of written speed drills still beats this tho.,3.0
"The car is great fun and my twenty month old daughter is very excited about it.  She calls the little storage bin a ""car seat"" and puts her baby dolls there and is having a great time being ""Mommy"" and driving her babies to see Grampa.  As a toy, I give it 5 stars.

But, it was a major pain to assemble. The instructions were clear, but many of the holes had extra plastic which had to be scraped out.  Some were not drilled out at all.  The roof did not go on at all (half the neighborhood tried) and then suddenly went on.  It seems fairly sturdy now and we're looking forward to having lots of fun.  But, I'm wary of buying more Little Tikes items in the future.",3.0
My son was bored with this... he would not use it.. Wish I could find something he'd use!,3.0
"My son received this toy as a hand-me-down and it's in great shape (hence the 5 stars for durability). The problem is that at 18 months (or younger) my son can't make it move forward with his feet, only backward which is frustrating for him. I have tried to push him around in it but his legs are too long and get all tangled up underneath the car which was frustrating for us both. He's pushed it around from behind but would rather ride in it.  He loves it and wants to play with it but I've hidden it in the far reaches of the garage until he's a little older.  Perhaps manufacturer's age should be 2 years and up instead of 18 mos.",3.0
"My son removes gas tank cap and puts items to the inside of the body of this. There is no way other than to drill a large whole into the bottom side to get items out. All the neighbors have the same problem also. If left outside the car fades and collects water in the back open ""trunk"" area. If the water is not emptied before use; my son's backside gets wet. I suggest drilling a small drainage hole in the trunk. My son is of average height for a 3 year old and is just about too tall for this.",3.0
"Yesterday was one of my children's third birthday, and my wife and I gave one of these fantastic cars to our child. Even unassembled, we could not bring our kid back to the party. He stayed there pretending he was driving, even without tires!!!

However, today during the assembly, with my kids all over me and trying to release the car, I faced the problem when installing the driving wheel. It has a plastic piece that is supposed to keep the wheel on the dash, but it does not. I am planning on buying a bolt and nut to keep it in place and forget about thIe whole thing, but I just wanted to share this. My kid obviously is happy with the car, but he has to be replacing the wheel everytime he gets excited and pulls it out.

I tried to contact littletikes via their web page, but there is not an option for defective design. They definitely need to revise this assembly and provide a better way to keep the wheel where it belongs.",3.0
"We have been using our MathShark for approximately two weeks now.
 I reviewed the directions and tried to pop in two new AA batteries. That is where the problems started.
The battery case does not slide off - it has a flat, wide screw that holds it in place, although the battery door was also warped and looked like it might not hold the batteries in place. The screw was put in at the factory in a crooked angle, so it took trying three different screwdrivers before we could remove it to get to the battery compartment. The batteries popped in without incident, and we had the same fun getting the cover back on, with the weird angled screw.

Once that was done, we turned it on to take it for a spin. It is pretty intuitive, and honestly, the directions would almost not be needed by most people. A light flashes green if you get the right answer and red if it is wrong. You can turn off the sound effects, which is pretty much preferable at our house. It feels fairly well balanced in our adult hands, and the kids didn't seem to have much trouble with it either.

The first thing I did not like was the screen. It is TINY compared to the size of the toy. The display fonts are extremely primitive! With so many to choose from now, this reminded me of the very early-on calculators or hand held games from the 1970's. They were hard to read many times. What made it worse is that this screen is not backlit. It is part of what makes it harder to read - a gray screen with either dark gray or light black letters and numbers. The contrast was not enough. And I don't know of any kid who doesn't like lying in bed and playing games! You sure can't do this one in a dark room, because all you'll see would be the red or green light.

Our model also had a problem with the number zero. Once in a while, a great deal of pushing, like you are trying to push the number button out the bottom of the machine would result in a zero, but otherwise, it just didn't respond. So every answer that has a zero in it (and of course, there are many) will be counted as wrong. Your answers are also timed, so don't waste time with buttons that don't work, because it will just increase your game time and your frustration.

There are some good things - I promise! The kids still liked it a little bit, but when they couldn't get the zero to work, they stopped playing with it. I kept trying different levels and skills just for the mental exercise. I found it was actually a bit fun to try to figure out various levels of math problems in my head, having been used to relying on a calculator so often. There are seven math skills covered in this game: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, fractions, decimals and percentages. Each math skill has eight levels that get progressively more difficult. Some of the levels were actually a little bit of a challenge for this ""old"" adult. The multiplying fractions function was a reminder of how much I'd forgotten since I didn't use it! Ha! I enjoyed the mental math and trying to get a high score, but then, I always have enjoyed any sort of computer games.

I would suggest the following changes to the manufacturer:
1) Add a backlight to the screen. Evenings while bored silly or long car rides (which can be day or night) are a great time to use this item, and it is too hard to see without an abundance of light.
2) Update the fonts used to a more legible one. It looks like I picked this up at a garage sale circa 1980.
3) Use a different screw on the back battery compartment. It didn't work well at all.

Overall, this definitely could be useful, but it is not too likely a child who has a PSP or Nintendo DS would give this much of a second glance. And with so many math games available for other gaming systems, I would think an individual handheld like this would be working overtime to make sure their item is more appealing. So, if your child doesn't have any of those other handhelds, then this would be an acceptable way to practice math skills, especially in the car. The game seems very sturdy and should survive several drops. Just test everything as soon as possible, and if you have a bad button, exchange it at your store for one that works.",3.0
"Seven year old not interested in using it alone, has to have someone to help  her.  Not very useful",3.0
"Great idea for a board game with lots of learning potential for younger children, however children 10+ years may soon find this formula a little unchallenging. Several improvements could make this a better product; notably, heavier paper for the frequently handled question cards, and a much larger map on the game board. Some of the countries appear too small for grandparents and children with poor eyesight. Also, the spinner is labeled with text that should be larger. With just a few design changes and the opportunity to purchase additional question card packs, perhaps geared towards different age groups, we could recommend this game more enthusiastically.",3.0
It's okay. Not really for my child. He got bored with it. But i will keep & use it for my daughter when she's older.,3.0
"It will provide 10 or problems for your child to solve, but you have to select the type and in some cases the number. There does not appear to be random function. It seems slow to respond and will definitely give you that 80's feel.

Buy an app for your mobile device, you will be happier with it.",3.0
My kids used it for a little  while but lost interest and I found some apps that keep them interested more than this device,3.0
I just received this item. I didn't purchase it through amazon.  My kids like it so far but the screen is hard to see.  It's a great concept and would probably help many kids but I think the Flashmaster might be better option.,3.0
"Bought for my seven year old grandson.  He had loved the electronic dictionary but found this toy below his level.  It did not hold his interest.  It only allows you to drill, like electronic flashcards - there is no ""game"" aspect to it so he gets bored fast. I could see keeping this in the car or using it as part of daily homework, but he's unlikely to pick it up and play just for fun.

It fits better in an adults hands than a childs, as it's quite bigger. The buttons feel almost old-fashioned, you really have to push them with force to make it register - I think if this was used often, the buttons would wear out. It's easy to figure out how to use it, but once you start one of the flashcard quizzes, there isn't a good way to exit. You have to finish the whole quiz or turn it off to start over on a different skill, which is a bit annoying if you start a quiz and realize it's too easy or difficult and want to change the level.

That's about it - a good tool but not a lot of ""fun"".",3.0
"We received it as a gift, but it's going back as the number buttons don't work.  You have to press really hard and maybe they would register.

Will order another one as our son really enjoys it in school and has been asking for one for some time. Unit was assembled without quality control it seems. Hopefully the replacement will work.",3.0
"I was hoping for a toy that would motivate my 7 year old to practice math on her own, since she hates flashcards.  She was easily bored with this as well.",3.0
"My 10 year old granddaughter was excited to learn two-digit multiplication for some reason...and immediately recognized that she had a deficiency in knowing her times tables.  She wanted help.  I read the reviews on it, and saw the negative ones, but there were more positive so I went for it.  I gave it to her yesterday and she did indeed like it.  And as a math teacher, I was pleased for the most part with the content and levels.  But as several other reviewers have said, it becomes a waste of money, because several of the buttons won't work unless pressed very hard.  In our case, it's the middle row of buttons.  In today's world of technology, that's just inexcusable.  One bad one is one thing, but from the reviews, this seems to be a common problem.  Sadly, we are sending ours back today.  She actually really wanted to play with it, but got frustrated, because she'd think she'd pressed the right answer and it would be wrong because of this button issue.

It has enough potential that I'm going to try one more.  If that one is a dud through, I may change my review to a 1 star!",3.0
"This came highly recommended, and it was not that expensive, so it was worth a try.  And to be fair, it was recommended because it got results (non-specific) with someone else's child, though somewhat younger than my 9 year old.

The LCD display is ancient, segments far apart, on a dull gray background.  Sound effects, equally old, remind me of a Radio Shack electronics hobby kit from 1980.

Younger kids are more tolerant of old technology and they can get things to work for them.  At 9, mine is borderline, and she didn't reject it outright, but I may have missed the age where it might have held the most appeal.  And after all, this is supposed to be fun or what is the point?  There are plenty of other ways to do drills.

Next thing I don't care for is the level of difficulty setting, and the way the device selects problems.  I will admit I have not spent a great deal of time with it but there seems to be little variety in the questions.  Example, division problems at mid-level difficulty - every problem was divide by 10.

So I can't recommend it.  It's bright colors and quirky LED/beeping feedback made a good first impression but they wore off fast.  But it could work for your child.",3.0
"Just got the math shark in the mail and my son is already inlove with it. I love the fact you can ajust the level for each subject weather it be subtraction, Division,since I have two kids. I will be able to let each one of them play it. Fast delivery! Great product. Thanks again :)",3.0
When students are taught to do solve math problems they work right to left when writing down the answers. The problem with this item is that you have to enter the far left number first working back to the right. This makes the need to have piece of paper to write down the number before typing it in which slows down the use.,3.0
"I think the product is effective for reinforcing math facts with the various levels.  One criticism I would put forth is that you must choose the number you wish to drill (e.g., addends +9) instead of having a random feature that would review all addition facts, for example at a given level.  The numbers are sometimes difficult for younger ones to discern given the very rudimentary graphics.  Overall, I would recommend the product because it does drill to mprove math skills quite simply, without a lot of fluff.",3.0
"The Math Shark is an incredible tool!  My son's skills and grades improved nearly immediately. I never have to fight with my little ""gamer""  to study his math facts anymore.  The only problem we have found with it is the screen...  it's very dark and difficult to see.  You have to get the lighting around you just so or you can't see what's showing on the screen.  Overall, it's great, but that's a real pain in the butt!",3.0
"My 8 year old doesn't mind using this a few times a week. They do a lot of math drills in school, but she was getting stuck. This is a different way for her to practice, in addition to old-fashioned paper and pencil. The screen is difficult to see if you are not right in front of it (I can't watch over her shoulder), but she says she can see it just fine.",3.0
"My 2 1/2 year old son is obsessed with school buses. He does enjoy playing with this toy, but not as much as I'd hoped. It has withstood several playdates with five 2-3 year olds jumping through it, on it, in it, etc. I think it is something he might need to grow into.",3.0
"I am a mother of 3 boys.  I purchased this item for my two oldest sons ages 2 and 4.  They enjoyed playing with the product.  It promotes imaginative play with two entrances, multiple windows and a steering wheel.

My complaint with the product is focused on its durability.  Quite often the bus will begin leaning and become unstable.  It frequently needs to have the support beams between the panels bent back into their original shape. For anyone buying this product be aware that it will most likely not look like new for very long.",3.0
I was so disappointed in this toy.  First let me say that my son did love it and was entertained but after the second use the toy would not stand straight.  It tilted and there was no way for me to get the rods straightened out.  I sent it back for a refund.  Looking for something more sturdy for a 18 month old.,3.0
"My 1 year old daughter loves this bus and the fact that she can crawl in and out with ease is great however, when she tries to stand up inside of it there is no support for her.  She has been inside it several times and when she tries to hold onto the sides of the bus it tips all the way over and then she ends up crawling out one of the windows of the bus rather than the door.  It will not hurt a child and she has never even cried when it tips over but it is just made from a thin material and can't support the weight of a baby pulling up on it.  She does like it however it is just very flimsy, but on the other hand the fact that it is lightweight allows us to store it underneath our couch and put it away easily.",3.0
"however the quality is not so great it ripped the second day we had it, but the kids can still play.",3.0
"my mother brought this game home when I was 10 years old and my sister was 6.  the box said something like 5 and up.  many of the questions are about first kisses, dating, high school, jobs and other things we had not experienced yet.  very few questions were things we could answer.  the game was really frustrating and sat in the closet for years, where friends would suggest we play it, so we would have to explain what a bad game it was.  I'm sure it's great for adults, but for kids, it's horrible.

Don't buy this game for your kids!",3.0
"This game is like being trapped in an airplane seat next to someone who's really, really bad at conversation, but won't stop trying.

It fell completely flat with our mixed-ages group, especially with the under-30 set.  Many of the questions just aren't that much fun and don't fire the imagination.  Picture asking a 12-year-old boy, for example, what kind of house or apartment he wants to live in... Well, he wants a cool one.  Beyond that, though, he can't define ""cool"" and hasn't thought about where, or with whom, or what it would look like, or let him do.

Now, ask a niece who's been the most influential person in her 9 years of life...now define ""influential"" for her....now ask her in what way that person was the most influential...now lose all momentum.

Even the alternatives lacked creativity.  Have each person make a funny face?  Come on!

I think it may have been okay for a 50-and-up crowd.  Our group, though, abandoned it after a desperate 30 minutes.  This was a games-happy crowd that went on to play other games happily for several hours.  I was really disappointed in Life Stories, to the point that I wish I could return it.",3.0
I played this one evening with my 18 year old son and his 16 year old girlfriend. It had questions that made each of us share memories or views of life. The questions were not all that interesting but it was nice to get the two of them to sit down and spend a half our or so with me talking.,3.0
Drum arrived with no drumsticks!,3.0
"Sounds great! Disappointed in the pattern/illustrations on the drum. Looks extremely cheap. Almost like a reproduction or a fake. Got the same drum years ago for my older son and the animals looked great! Great color, looked like it was supposed to. Too bad we gave that away and had to buy another, years later. The white plastic mallets look cheap, too. They were all black before. The white draws your attention to the fact that they're plastic.",3.0
These are ok.  They are a little bit firmer than I expected.,3.0
"While passing these back and forth, one of the seams split.  Not the sturdiest, but good if you don't get super rambunctious.",3.0
Not all the same size or density. a lot more varied than others I have bought,3.0
"The stitching is already loose on one of the balls, and I've hardly used them. Nice size and weight, though.",3.0
"For learning, this is fine, but the seams are not very high quality and after a couple of months, practicing only a couple times a week, two of the balls started losing the little plastic pellets that are inside the ball.  I also think they are a bit light, but that is just my personal preference, I have nothing to base that on.  Light may very well be the key to good juggling and I may be 100% wrong on that critique!",3.0
Overall a good ball. A bit light and smaller then I expected.,3.0
"hello, i have bought classic juggling balls, but i recieved mini juggling balls -_-",3.0
"Obviously cheap and not very round. Still juggleable, though.",3.0
"It's a bit loud for my liking. My kid liked the drum, but it got the same amount of action as the empty coffee can drum.",3.0
"I was expecting standard size juggling balls. What i received was labeled ""Junior Juggling Balls"" and they are smaller than described here.

I was planning on running away to join the circus. This has delayed my plans.",3.0
"The seams kept coming loose, so I had to resew them. It's works well overall, good for juggling and hacky sack tricks..",3.0
"You get what you pay for they are inexpensive and cheaply made (very light) So for the price they are good. They are Made in China.
I wish we bought American made, expensive, but high quality juggling balls instead.",3.0
"The balls are pretty solid.  They were well packed, and slightly football shaped.  The only drawback is that one ball split open after just a few minutes of use.  The Amazon replacement process is in play so we'll see how the second set works.",3.0
I love to juggle and these balls make it easy to do so.  My complaint is that they are stitched very poorly and two of the three have too much stuffing (beans).  They need a bit more quality control.,3.0
These were a pretty good product and have held up alright with little exception. That exception though is that within the first few days I picked up a dropped ball and found that one of the seams had started to split. Little bit of gaff tape fixed that problem though. They are adequate but the workmanship leaves a little to be desired.,3.0
Didn't double check the actual size before ordering. They are too small for an adult but good for a child. Unfortunately I ordered them for an adult.,3.0
"To reiterate what other reviewers have stated, these balls are not consistent size or weight.  However, they are an inexpensive juggling prop for the beginner and the inconsistency issues can somewhat be addressed by purchasing more than you require and choosing the best matching subset.  But at what does the expense of purchasing extra, unused balls exceed the cost of purchasing a professional set in the first place?  That is a question for you must answer for yourself.

The balls are durable with initial stiffness loosing up with use.",3.0
"I can't comfortably use these to juggle because they're too darn small.  I got a set of three from an event that were perfect, so I decided to get three more online so I can start to learn to juggle more than 3 balls, but when these came, they were really small.  I have big hands, and I just use these to play with my daughter.  If anyone knows which of the 600 juggling balls listed on amazon are good (just like these only big enough to fill your hand), please let me know.  Thanks.",3.0
"The balls are effective for juggling but the stitching is poor quality. I had to sow one up myself when it started to come apart and I'll soon have to do the same with a second ball. In all fairness, they only started to wear after being thrown against walls fairly hard. Still, it's reasonable to expect a little more durability.",3.0
"You get what you pay for.  I needed to learn to juggle quickly and these were available with two day free shipping from prime.  Shipped out and arrived super fast, and the price was cheap.  But so are the balls. After three days the seams were coming apart on one.  I ordered two more sets because I couldn't really afford to wait for long shipping.  I've been alternating my juggling practice with the first two sets for the last five days, and two balls are literally falling apart.  But I suspect I will have three relatively intact  juggling balls by the end of the week.  Long term, I'll need to find something higher quality, as it appears multiple drops from five feet off the ground is all it takes before these start to fall apart.",3.0
"I bought this copy of Uno thinking that ""original"" might mean something other than the contemporary graphics.  The box did not contain the word ""original"" as advertised here, and a user-uploaded image of Uno is nothing like the one shipped.  The cards were smaller than the traditional version of Uno.  While I'm happy to have a set of Uno cards, I'm disappointed that it didn't have the original artwork or the original sizes for a product advertised as ""original"" on Amazon.  Just be aware.

EDIT 12/14/2010: It looks like Amazon has changed the image. This is the image of the game we received. Now you know.

EDIT 1/5/2011: It looks like Amazon has changed thei mage back. Sigh.",3.0
"Received on a Friday. By the end of the weekend had threads pulling out, not just stitches loosening. I melted the loose thread down to the surface after pulling it tight, but the other half of the stitch it should have been part of is still completely loose to the point of being able to see inside the ball. Hopefully the opening won't get any wider.
  If you don't mind stitching that won't hold for any length of time under gentle use, the balls are actually very comfortable and confidence inspiring, due to ease of handling.",3.0
"I received two sets of these for christmas. They're okay. They aren't very uniform in weight and I hate that the filling isn't fine, like sand or bird seed. They are bulky, not spherical, and generally cheaply made. They are okay for learning but I would recommend taht you spend more to get better quality. I work at a camp, so I use these mainly with 10 - 15 year olds who I teach to juggle. I don't care much for them and because they are so cheap, thats the only reason I keep them around: I'd rather these get totally ruined by a camper than my good set get slightly damaged by a camper.",3.0
"The balls are a nice size and weight for juggling or learning to juggle. If you can't tell the exact size which I couldn't from the pictures, the balls are about the size of a tennis ball, maybe slightly smaller.  They are a little stiff when you begin to use them but they seem to break in quite easily.  The inside of each ball contains a plastic bag with a bean bag type material inside.  The corners of the plastic bag inside can be felt from the outside of the ball's vinyl skin but that will soften as the balls are broken in.  The set came with juggling instructions which I found to be very helpful.  The one problem that I had with the set, was that after juggling with them (on carpet) for about three or four times within first week of receiving them, the seam began to open on one of the balls.  Instead of going through the hassle of returning them, I super glued the seam back together and the ball is as good as new.  So beware when purchasing this set but otherwise, they work as intended.",3.0
"These balls are cheap and it shows. They're not filled all the way making them somewhat awkwardly shaped, not really spherical. They're also not all filled the same amount, giving them slightly different individual weight. That being said, they get the job done fairly well. I have my doubts about the long term durability of these things, but in the short term they're fine, if you're looking to try out juggling to see if you like it, but don't want to spend a lot of money in case you don't, then these balls are perfect. If you're already into juggling and just want a cheap set to mess around with, I would suggest something a little higher quality than these.",3.0
"These are the first bean-bag-type juggling balls I have used, so I can't really compare them with any others.  (Previously, I have used tennis balls, etc.) They are okay and cheap.  However, they came squashed into a container that was too small, resulting in them being somewhat squashed.  Also, they aren't really round, and my guess is that their weights vary somewhat.  Not sure if those issues are important to others, but they surprised me.",3.0
"I would have liked to know that the balls appeared to have been repaired.  They work, but each ball appears to have been re-sewn on a seam.  This makes them not smooth.  It would have been nice to know this info in advance and I probably would not have purchased balls in this used condition.",3.0
"Just to repeat what others have reported.  Overall the cards, score pad, and instruction booklet are top quality.  It doesn't make sense why the  picture of the bird on the back side is upside down from the face of the cards.  Also,the shade of yellow used is so light it's actually hard to see.  These two flaws make an otherwise great card package just average.",3.0
"Hi folks
This is a cool drum
My son is three and has loved it for about 6months now
Sadly the top is starting the crack
Also parents take the black cover tip off the bottom of the stick or it can become a choking hazard.",3.0
"Package was scuffed, but doll was unique.",3.0
"The drum is well made and the construction is solid.  But our only issue is the tone of the drum.  It seems off and doesn't have a great sound when we play it.  It's a deep sound but note-wise, it's hard to match with songs.  We're not professionals so I'm not sure how to describe that, but compared to drums we use in the kids' music class, it's not as pleasant of a sound.",3.0
"As a homemaker of 3 teenagers I'm always looking for stuff for us to do. I had some Uno cards and as teenagers do, they got spilled on. So I came on and ordered new ones. I was pretty disappointed that what I ordered was classic and what I got was customizable wild. It's all the same I suppose. Just wasn't what I expected to get.",3.0
"The game I received is not the one in the picture. The one I received has ""write on"" cards, and I did not want that. I was actually wanting the original Uno cards.",3.0
"These were the wrong cards and came with customizable wilds, but weren't fake and overall were as entertaining as the old ones, but was still disappointing.",3.0
They look good.  Don't hold up too long if you play a lot of cards.,3.0
"My kids find this hard to play with. The directions or ideas are very poor. There are many sizes and not all of them fit together, so the toy can be very frustrating. My girls are 5 and 6 and plenty old enough to be able to figure this out, but even I found it to be challenging to get something large together that actually worked. I wouldnt recommend this one.",3.0
Didn't hold my 6 year old sons attention for long.,3.0
"A lot less challenging than I had hoped for. Also, one of the gears broke right away. However, it still entertained my niece for a few hours.",3.0
"My 7 year old daughter received this as part of her monthly STEM subscription. I can be a little challenging get the pieces to fit together correctly. Both springs broke after a few times playing. A great educational toy, but may require a lot of adult help.",3.0
"too small for baby to hit, does best with large one",3.0
"If you intend to buy one of these little gems you
you had better buy 2 of them!  The light burns out within
the year (with regular use)and it is a true pain to change it.
The cost of a second one would be well worth the aggravation
you are going to save.  It is a real shame something so cool
can't last.  It obviously does not burn many candle watts so I can find no reason for this.  There are NO instructions anywhere for changing the bulb either.  Wonderful idea, not much thought into its problem though.",3.0
"Gears are fine. Some of the accessories are terrible. The springs are impossible for a small child to push in (plus the kids snap them and break them when trying to get them in or out), the little red pieces are useless and just annoy the kids. The swirls are stickers you place on the gears turning them into ends and cannot connect to anything without ripping the stickers. Overall get the other gear set for more value and interest for the kids.",3.0
"This got about two uses out of my kids, who are 6 and 8. The spring doesn't quite work as pictured. It just tends to pull gears off their base. It's a clever idea, but just didn't seem to captivate the attention as you'd hope",3.0
"It is true that the product is not as advertised/pictured.  This is UNO with customizable wild cards and there is no mention of this in the description.  However, this is a perfectly good set and a quality product.  Our purchase for $7.99 in 12/16 from Hold N Storage on Amazon is a Mattel product.  I guess that when you have several storefronts selling a similar product then the main image won't always match your purchase.",3.0

"You can't really make a ring with the dolphins.  And the dolphins won't whistle if there is water in them.  But you if you blow the water out by blowing up through the base you can get it to whistle - which my daughter loves.  If you weren't in a bath with a two year old you could probably play tunes as well but they don't really stay dry that long in practice.
But they are cute, good for learning colors, nearly indestructable (which surprised me) and fun to play with!",3.0

its just what my  mom  wanted,3.0
"I love Gears! Gears! Gears! but this set has some limitations. It's not big enough to be the only set you buy, and as an expansion, it's not the value other sets offer. If you have a basic set and are looking for a set with the different size gears, this doesn't compare to Wacky Factory which is usually $5-11 more and has almost double the pieces.
Wacky Factory vs. Gizmos
Large Base Plates 6 vs. 3
Medium Base Plates 8 vs. 4
Small Base Plates  12 vs. 7
Large Gears 8 vs. 4
Medium Gears 12 vs. 5
Small Gears 24 vs. 11
Square Pillars 12 vs. 9
Small Pillars 18 vs. 12
Pillar Connectors 8 vs. 6
Six-Way Axles 12 vs. 6
Peg Adapters 8 vs. 4
Cranks 1  and 1

So you're really paying for the specialty pieces in this set:
1 propeller
2 T-pillars
2 springs
1 pronged gear
2 angled pillar prongs

In the Bloom Flower Garden, there are at least 3 angled prong pillars and 2 pronged gears, and other sets like the Movin' Monkeys have some too. The T-pillar doesn't do much more than you can't do with a regular pillar, axle, and short pillars. So, unless you REALLY want a propeller and two springs, you'd be better off getting a themed set with more specialty pieces as your introduction and Wacky Factory as your expansion set. Check prices and keep an eye out for warehouse deals to get the best value.",3.0
The score pad is too small to write on.  It is laughable!,3.0
"I think this drum has an annoying ringing sound, personally.  You have to dampen it with your hand for it to have a nice sound and my LO definitely doesn't do that.",3.0
I had seen this available in so many places I thought this would be a great tub toy.  It is as long as you are just looking for something to float around the tub in many pieces.  It is super hard to get these things to even make a sound.  In the end my 2 year old likes to drown them and they have held up.,3.0
The springs are plastic coils and broke quite easily from the gear and cannot be reattached. My daughter still has tons of fun playing with it. She is very interested in building/engineering type toys. I would probably recommend it as a starter kit for younger children.,3.0
"I bought these cards to replace a deck that my family had worn out.  I wanted to get cards that would last a little longer, so I bought the deluxe set.  Unfortunately, it appears that ""deluxe"" isn't what I expected.  The cards are slightly smaller than the previous deck and they don't appear to have the plastic coating I was expecting for durability.  They are thick - so much so that shuffling them is a challenge.  I can't say I'm not a little disappointed.",3.0
These cards have lots of small red birds on the back side not like the original cards.  Were the same as original where the numbers are.,3.0
"Reservations:  check this out before giving it as a gift.  Keep in mind that it's plastic, not machine-tooled metal, so some of the pieces may need a little trimming (sharp pocket or paring knife) to fit properly.  Also--important for younger kids--the pieces that connect the columns together fit VERY tightly (in fact must fit tightly in order for things to line up right) and may be extremely difficult to pull apart when trying different arrangements.  I've had to resort to a thin-bladed screwdriver to get some apart.  I'm mentioning these issues not as deal-breaking flaws but just as a warning that this may not be instant magic-out-of-the-box. Strongly advise you assemble various combinations yourself before giving to a child, not least because the instructions are minimal.

That said, it's an interesting set and I don't regret buying it, altho it's not nearly as exciting as I anticipated--but that's a very subjective thing and hopefully the recipient will like it much better.",3.0
It may have been fine but there were to many parts and it was too advanced for our boy (and his daddy).  :),3.0
"Hard to find rook cards, so was glad to find these. The cards are flimsy though and don't hold up well. They were not in expensive either",3.0
Received this for my 1-yr-old and he still plays with it sometimes - he is now 3. It is really hard to get it to play music how it is intended to be played with. It is also way too big - I hate drying out all of the peices all the time when my son is done with it in the bath. He likes to play with the dolphins individually and just pretends with them instead of using it as it as advertised. It has poor musical ability...Buy something more fun with your money!,3.0
"I hope my mistake helps someone else. I came across this item which shows a picture of the storage table with the gears. FYI - you DON'T get the storage table with this gear set. It's sold separately for $80. The photo with the storage table doesn't sell this specific product and should be removed - or at least mentioned in the disclaimer. It's misleading.

Also, the kids really enjoyed playing with these before -we thought perfect Christmas gift! However, contrary to my original thought, you really only need one set, not the standard set plus a motorized set to keep them from getting bored. Your primary set can be one of the motorized sets which already include over 100 gears!",3.0
My fears have been realized.  I was hoping against hope that the quality would be better than what many have previously described it as...which is a low quality type deck of cards.  The only reason I'm going to hang on to these and not return them is because the design on the back of the card is unique from other maker's designs--important when other players also bring their cards.  Buyer be warned:  these cards are of really bad quality.,3.0
"The box set is nice, the score pad and huge instruction booklet on the many ways to play the game, how to keep score, etc...

BUT, the cards are not like the cards of even 10 years ago as far as durability.  I bought these thinking they might be better than the Hasbro brand I had been buying at Wal-Mart, but they are very similar in durability.  Very easily bent, flimsy, and wear out quickly.  They will wear out after a few nights of playing, of course depending on how much they are played and shuffled each night.

Nice set if you want a nice rule book and score pad,  but if you know the game already and just want the cards, there are cheaper priced options out there that are the same in durability or better.",3.0
"My toddlers love the dolphins and have fun with them in the water but when the product gets wet, they do not make noise. Since they are a bath toy, that's a problem. Once the dolphin's head is submerged, they lose the ability for sound. That was disappointing and misleading.",3.0
"These cards are soooo very thin!  The game, of course, is awesome but the quality of the cards sucks.  I thought they would be similar to playing cards with a similar finish.  Too bad. Otherwise would have given them a 5 star review.  The seller was outstanding. Very quick shipping.",3.0
"I bought this register used at Goodwill for my 3 year old niece. She was with me when I bought it and loved it right away, even when the batteries weren't put in. We brought it home and her 15 month old sister adored it too. The only problem about this toy is the microphone. It absolutely drove their parents crazy! That's pretty much the only part of the register the girls played with and she figured out that if she put the microphone in her mouth and blew on it, a VERY loud feedback sound would occur! I didn't think the microphone was real when I bought it or that it would cause such problems. So, it is a good toy, but the microphone can be annoying, which is probably why I found the toy at Goodwill in the first place. :)",3.0
"I had such high hopes for this toy! My 4-year-old received it for Christmas and just loved it -- especially the microphone. But the entire thing (except the microphone) stopped working less than 3 weeks after Christmas! To make matters worse, when I went to exchange it, I couldn't find it at any local Target store so, since I bought it at 1/2 price right before Christmas, I had to return it and lose out on my special deal. (Not to mention a VERY sad little girl...) The lady who helped me with the return said her grand-daughter had one going on 3 years so I'm hopeful mine was just a lemon, but the reviews I've read on other boards seem to indicate a real problem with durability. I probably will buy another one (though probably not at the normal $40 price tag -- the toy isn't durable enough for that kind of price), but will make sure I keep the receipt AND the box it came in for awhile...",3.0
"I got this toy for my niece about 5 years ago for her 1st birthday.  She loved it, and I was told that she had to have them in the bath al the time.  So this time, I got it for my daughter.  She think's they're ""ok."" Actually she prefers them as a pool toy.  The can be very educational for learning colors if you are willing to put the time in to do it.",3.0
"My daughter....now 12 months old likes to play with the rings, but not so much the dolphins.  The dolphins will make different musical sounds, but often fill up with water and have to be emptied to make any noise.  Do not buy this product if you are interested in making music.  If your child just wants to play with a tub toy, it is just fine.",3.0
"Well, we put this on our registry-- mostly because of the bright colors (and I happened to think it looks cute!) My son is 7 months old, and I just took it out for him to play with during a bath.  My husband & I both took turns testing it out...what we found is that it isn't very loud (when you tap their heads) but it is loud enough to hear...you kind of have to tap it hard enough, though... the only thing that kind of bothered me while we were testing was that when we would tap them on the head, they kept unhooking in the bath tub... I'm sure any moms who have tried this know what I mean.  They just wouldn't stay in their link, looped together.  But, either way, I still like it...I would probably buy it again, just for the colors and the water play for my son.  It is pretty cute to look at.",3.0
"To start out with, I accidentally ripped the tail off one of the dinos while removing them from the cutout sheet and I was trying to be careful.  Within a few short months, the entire thing ripped in half, had ruffled corners, was indented in several places and more dinos kept losing body parts.  I gave it 3 stars because my 3 year old son did love playing with it and the few remaining intact dinos are holding up notes on my fridge.  I advise not leaving it out with other toys and put it out of reach right after use and it would probably last longer.",3.0
I have a 1 yr old daughter and a 6 yr old son. He was so excited when he opened it but lost interest very quickly in the tub. These are very cute but if they do make any music it is just whistles. You tap them on their heads and hopefully they will work. My 1 yr old simple handed a dolphin to me and tapped them a couple of times.,3.0
"This word game came out to be hampered by the word restriction when I played.  Two players bid down from 25 on how many words it'll take them to get their team to say five specific words.  Success gains the card and failure forfeits it to the other team.  It was tough to get people to say any words even without the time restriction.  Someone would always win the bid at some ludicrous number like 5 just to take the bet, and then not get one word correct.  The fact that the number of words is restricted prevented it from being a blurting game like Outburst or Taboo.  I would recommend this game for large parties only.",3.0
"I bought this toy a little over a year ago for my daughter's first birthday.  I saw it and thought it was cute and a good price, but when I took it out of the box and put it together I was very disappointed.  The little rings are supposed to hook together and float in the bathtub, but all they do is fall apart. That didn't bother me though. What did bother me about them was the fact that they weren't really that fun, the tones aren't that great, and about the only educational value they have is teaching your children the color of the dolphins.  My daughter does still use them in her bath, but she doesn't pay a whole lot of attention to them.",3.0
"first of all to get all the pieces to the pool requires a small bag, then the toy does not stay connected in the pool as soon as the smallest wave comes near it.  the toy does make sounds but my daughter still at two does not seem to be to impressed.",3.0
"My kids (3.5 and 2) received this as a gift, and at first I was excited--it's cute and colorful.  In theory, a great toy.  However, my kids don't like it.  Water gets inside the dolphins and when this happens, they won't make noises (easily remedied by shaking the water out of them, but my kids don't have the patience for this).  They also get very frustrated that the rings that the dolphins sit in do NOT stay linked together.  Slight movements that disturb the water will cause the chain to come apart.  I'm sure that this would be a favorite bath toy with a few improvements made by the company.",3.0
"Great game, but many cards inside were damaged.  Raise your standards please.",3.0
"I bought this used at a baby tag sale, so keep that in mind when reading my review.  The dolphins are much bigger than it seems in the picture, each ring is 4"" or so across.  The dolphins fascinate my daughter (1 year) and she does enjoy the toy, but they barely make any noise (keep in mind it is used) and the rings will not stay attached to one another.  Instead we just have the 8 dolphins floating around the tub.  I think its well worth the $2 I paid, but I would not pay the retail price on this toy!",3.0
"I purchased this toy last christmas for my daughter to use in the tub. The colors are vivid, the dolphins are cute, and I liked the idea of a musical bath.
Each dolphin fits snuggly into a matching colored ring. After you get all of the dolphins into the rings, you (and here is the fun part---not) link together the rings to form a circle arranging the notes from lowest to highest. If, and when, you get the rings linked together, you bonk the dolphins on the head and a weak, but obvious note sounds.
My daughter likes to play with this toy, but keeping the dolphins linked together in a circle is a task. So, to sum it up, we can't create songs in the tub, but she still enjoys bonking the free floating individual dolphin/ring sets on their heads.
FUN TOY: 3 out of 5: My daughter still enjoys the toy even though it doesn't exactly do what it should.
TOY'S EDUCATION: 2 out of 5: If you can get the dolphins to stay in order it would be alot more educational.
TOY'S DURABILITY: 5 out of 5: This toy has been stepped on, chewed on, and thrown and is still in great condition. The colors have also stayed vibrant throughout a years worth of baths.",3.0
I have my original game board from the 60's. This one I ordered for my Grandson to have because he likes playing it.. The holes are TOO SMALL! The marbles keep falling out when you try and make a play because your fingers bump the marbles next to the one you are moving! Please make the board bigger and user friendly!  I would pay a little more for it to have one like the original..My old board used regular sized marbles...These use pea size!,3.0
Don't make much sound n smaller than I thought,3.0
Great product - well made etc. BUT I wish it was just a bit bigger. Another inch or two diameter would make it easier to play without jostling the marbles on the board.,3.0
The quality is poor but the game is facinatig,3.0
"Like many of the others, I was expecting great things from this toy. However, it didn't meet my expectations. I thought we would have great fun making music in the tub - but the whistles are pretty pathetic. On the other hand, it is good for matching up colors and learning their names (how many 2 year olds know ""aqua"" and ""magenta""?). (Note, though, that the dolphins and rings are made of different plastics so it's not an exact match!) It wasn't a total loss, but it's not a great find either.",3.0

"Great game for adults and kids I use to play with my Grandmother as a child and still love those memories. I read the negative reviews and thought I could change out the plastic marbles for glass ones and all would be good. Well if you are a child, it could be, but I gave the tin to my grandson and taught him to play, we played a few games, it was difficult even for him because the holes are so tight together ""no room for your fingers to pick up the marbles"", he is 9 and still was bumping into the marbles. I noticed a scratch in the paint of the board by the time we were done. So my review of the product is just OK. The glass marble replacements for the plastic ones included shipping cost about $10.00. This game board is about 11.5"" and the one Grandma had was 12.5 to 13.00"". That one inch does make a difference. All in all, with the glass replacement marbles, it is OK for the kids, but to interact with them on this game board, you have to be careful not to bump other marbles while trying to make a move. Also the height is just the marbles height. If they overlap in a bag, the game board doesn't close properly. Shipping and the transaction was very good, but I was hoping for a board like my Grandmothers, this board is smaller and does have plastic marbles.",3.0

"I ordered these mainly because I needed a few more dollars to get free shipping and we had been talking about getting a regular UNO game.  What I received in the mail are cheap knock-offs to the real UNO cards.  They feel cheap, they look cheap, and didn't even come with the rules (which we actually wanted when a question came up about playing...).  They do work, however, and since they are played with by a 3 year old and a 5 year old, I'm not concerned if they get ripped or bent.",3.0
"Ok this will seem odd, but my son does not like the new card design with the swirls. He is autistic and little things are big things to him.

The new deck was brand new and in great shape, though.",3.0

"Smaller then expected, twins lost interest after  2 days if playing.",3.0
"Ehhh. Doesn't work as advertised really, have to modify, which annoys me, but whatever, as long as you're up for that, it's okay. I could have just built one from scratch based on the principle with more satisfaction probably.
The main issue is that, following the instructions precisely, it blows the valve within a couple seconds when you haven't even had time to set it down and get away, thus making a mess, being a potential danger, and irritating you and the expectant kids watching. Attempting to tighten the plug more results in stripping the red ""rocket nozzle"" grip from the nut underneath. Going to modify the plug and try again. I think some better designing/R&D could have prevented this, but... what am I thinking.",3.0
I had high hopes for this after reading other reviews but it didn't hold my kids attention.  It is cool the first time you play with it to see all the gears work but after that the play is limited.  The magnets hold isn't as strong as I would have expected... when I store it in the toy closet standing up the magnets tend to fall off.  For the price I wish I would have bought a more educational or fun toy.,3.0
"This drum is okay. We have the floor tom and love it, was hoping for the same quality from the gathering drum. While this drum is huge and 3 toddlers can easily gather around it to drum...the drum head itself is very pitchy and sounds loose in several spots, and makes different noises. Sounds almost vibratory in nature and if If it had an area to use a drum key I would love to adjust/tighten it. I'm hoping that over time as the natural fibers wear it evens out, but overall good for kids.",3.0

"I bought this toy for my kids. They love it. It gives them something different to play with. The Gearation toy teaches them about cause and effect when they connect the gears together. My only complaint  would be the price. I think it is a little over priced for plastic case around the magnetic board. It should be a little tougher around the outside. I would recommend this product for younger children. The ""small"" gears are not very small. They are the size of my 18 month olds palm.",3.0

"My 8 yr old, was extremely excited to receive a rocket for Christmas, and could not wait to put it together.  Very disappointed in the quality of items in the kit. Unfortunately the directions were printed out of order, and therefore very hard to follow, we managed after an hour or two to put it together.  The rocket launches before we are able to place on the launch pad. After two launches it seems the rocket won't last for many more.",3.0
Fun to build but poor manufacturing of the nozzle meant that we could not tighten it into the bottle adequately to form a good seal - basically it strips. We got a few decent launches out of it but it would have gone much higher if the nozzle weren't stripped.,3.0
This toy takes a lot of supervision.  Even when constructed it is a tricky process to get it to launch.  We lauched it about 6 times with the best shot reaching about 60 ft.  We all learned about rocket construction and chemistry.,3.0

"Really liked all the gears that came with this toy, a nice variety with sounds (bells, clickers), eyes that move and flip, and the various decals that make them interesting.  The only thing I don't like is that the magnets could be a little stronger.  They don't really fall off, but a small accidental nudge as you are arranging them and they tend to shift so you have to go back and nudge them around until they are all touching again.  It says you can move them manually, but becuase they shift so easily, it is hard to do this w/o the gears moving apart.

Overall a good toy.",3.0
Handicapped grandaughter demolished toy within one week after Christmas.  Mouthed the gears when left alone with toy and removed some of the paint and magnets.  Really loved playing with it tho.  Too expensive to purchase again. She plays with one at therapy where she is closely watched.,3.0

"I'm a bit torn on this one.  I would have thought my kids (4 and 2) would have loved this, and they still play with it occasionally, but it definitely just does not have the staying power of some of the best toys we have.

I personally love it, think it's cool as everything, but it's not for me :)

One thing I AM surprised at is the durability.  My 2 year old will just yank the control button back and forth forcefully from reverse to fwd, and the thing still works.  I kind of cringe, thinking of a fwd/reverse gear and how bad that would be, but it appears the designers knew kids would do this.

Could just be a thing with my kids (both girls) interests at their particular stages, but definitely not one of their favorites.

We bought in the hopes of this being a good ""airplane trip"" toy, but 1. it's too big (there is a smaller version I think) and 2. not enough long term interest holding potential (at least for my kids).

I think this is a big YMMV toy.  If your kids like building, and legos and blocks and such, they would probably love this.  If they are more the reading, music, pretend type, maybe not so much.

Quality, construction and concept are all great imo, but I have to give three stars based on my kids reaction.  I would actually like to give it 3.5 because I think it's better than just average.",3.0
"This is a sturdy piece of equipment which is important. But I am quite disappointed in the quality of sound. The size is perfect for my three year old grand children.

"My parents purchased this as a toy to have at their house when my daughter visited. We had high expectations, it looked like it would be a awesome toy.

She was a little over 2 when they got it. She couldn't put it together herself but would enjoy doing it with grandma and would laugh at it but it never really got her attention. She'd play with it when we did but not otherwise. We thought as she got older, it would get more use but that never happen. Once she was around 3 1/2 - 4 she could use it by herself but again it just didn't keep her attention. She loves puzzles and other games where she builds or puts things together so not sure why this didn't keep her attention but it doesn't.

My parents have had this toy for around 2 years now and it still works fine - we haven't had some of the issues other reviewers have had but it didn't get used a ton either.",3.0

"While I do like the look and sound of this drum, I was searching for an instrument ""made in the USA"". This product is made in China.

"This drum is a lot of fun and you can play with it several ways.  It is especially fun to watch little toys (e.g. plastic chain links) ""dance"" on the surface and to experiment with ways to change the sound.  We immediately tried to figure out how to muffle it! Unless you live in a remote village and regularly need to call neighbors to a gathering, you may find this at least a bit *too* loud.  We have an average size home and we can only tolerate it for relatively short time periods.  I seriously doubt that this is the best choice for apartment or condo dwellers.  I was surprised by just how much louder this drum is in person as compared to the sound perceived when I watched the great video review.

"I ordered this as a Christmas present, and I won't lie. It's VERY tiny for a boardgame, so tiny it fit in my mailbox! Plus, it is very cheaply made. Everything is cardboard, even the tokens.

This drum is the same quality that my daughter uses at music class. If you want a gathering drum of high quality this is a perfect product for you. However is you want 3 drums don't buy this the photo is deceptive. Like others I purchased this because I thought I was getting 3 drums and you are only getting 1 gathering drum. I would have rather have gotten the bongos and the Tom Tom drum for the price because I wanted multiple drums at my house for playgroups. I also really wanted the standing drum since my daughter is a new walker and sitting is not of great interest these days. I gave this 3 stars because it was decptively advertised. I would give the 1 drum 5 stars if the picture was changed and though expensive I have seen this drum other places for around $75 so the price on Amazon is reasonable for this product.,3.0
Ok,3.0
"I had one like this as a kid and it was very helpful.  I bought one for my son and daughter.  They don't seem as interested, but the numbers are a little hard to see when you push the buttons.  I guess it could be because I'm getting older!

*Edit 6/21/17: The company sent a replacement pole set to me at no charge. I am changing this review from 1 star to 3 stars. I still think the quality is subpar, but at least the company honors its 1 yr warranty. After the warranty is over, I will be out of luck, so I would say save your money if you want something to last > 1 year. I will edit this review when the replacement pole set breaks. I have not set it up yet (I don't want to set it up until I need to use it because I'm afraid it will stress it unnecessarily)",3.0
"My 7 yr old daughter loves this game and it is fun even for older kids and adults to play unlike some kids' games.  It is basically a memory game with a fun twist -- there are 12 sets of valuable objects depicted on 24 cards.  Three of the cards are randomly chosen and placed behind the ""secret door"".  The rest of the cards are shuffled, along with 12 cards depicting clocks, and then all these cards are placed on designated spots on the board.  Each player takes a turn by turning over two cards, trying to find matching valuable objects.  If you find a match, you remove the pieces from the board.  If you don't find a match, you turn the pieces back over and try to remember where they were in case you find either object somewhere else on the board (like a typical memory game).  Players work together and can help each other remember where pieces are hidden.  There are also 12 clocks hidden among the valuable objects.  If you turn over a clock, it is removed from the board and placed on the row of clocks at the top of the board.  The goal is the game is to collect enough matches that you can figure out which three cards are missing (hidden behind the secret door).  Players win if they can figure out the missing objects before all 12 clocks are found.  I would have given this game 5 stars except for the INCREDIBLY poor quality of the game for the price.  The board itself is only 12"" square and doesn't even lie flat very well.  The cards are made of super thin card stock with no coating, so they will wear out fast.  And the artwork is very crude.  When folded, the board doesn't even fit well into the box -- we have to jam it in to fit.",3.0
Hard to read answers unless you have VERY good lighting.  Wish this came with batteries and could light up to more easily read the answers.,3.0

"We purchased these and the Djembe for my kids. While the Djembe has a wonderful, rich sound, the Bongos sound flat. To be clear, I am not a drummer, so I suspect I am doing something wrong. I did try holding them several different ways, but couldn't quite get the sound I wanted. Since I want my kids to be able to play these easily, I will be sending them back. As far as workmanship and durability, they seem to be well crafted and sturdy. However, I would recommend trying other Remo kids drums instead.",3.0
"Toy works well, it's just that the answers are very light, and you have to use the very tip of your finger to press down or the answers will be covered by it.",3.0
"I thought this game would be better made; mostly consists of very small cardboard pieces.  But it's OK for the low price.  Played it several times on Christmas and is good that it is a cooperative game, especially for the younger kids who get easily discouraged with games that are competitive.",3.0
"I was disapppointed by the sound and tone of the drum, especially if played with the bare hands, and it failed to raise the curiosity of my 1 year old the way pots and pans easily did.
Overall it is not a big improvement compared to the empty can of baby formula that my son used to drum on before.
Any typical drum classified as ethnic percussion would do a better job at making interesting and exciting sounds: darbuka, djembe, sabar, tablas, congas, cajon.
On the positive side the graphic is very appealing to toddlers, the rubber bottom saved the hardwood floor from serious damage and the kid can even make it roll like a wheel without any problem.",3.0
"As many other reviewers have mentioned, the quality of manufacture for this game is really poor. The pieces are made of very thin cardboard with no coating over the image side for added strength/durability, unlike most cardboard game pieces.

When you initially receive the game the pieces are all stuck together as part of a thin cardboard page and you have to pop the pieces out. Unfortunately, when popping them out they very, very easily rip and many of ours now have rips on the back. It would be easy for someone playing the game a lot to realize which cards have what ripped backs, therefore taking away some of the excitement of the game (you're not supposed to know what each card is until you turn it over).

The game is pretty inexpensive (we paid $12ish for it), but we've bought other games for comparable prices that were far superior in construction (not falling apart day one)

Our daughter is  7 1/2 an she likes this game. She'll play it alone or with others. I don't know how long it will last due to the poor quality of manufacture, but for the time being she's happy.

SUMMARY: Young kids like it, but it's very poorly made.",3.0
"I just bought this game for my 4 year old who likes memory games. We both have fun playing this game. The concept is good but the quality of the game is poor. The board is okay but the cards are made of thin cardboard. It's little difficult to setup the game and to pick the cards as they easily slide around. I may try an idea given by one of the reviewer here to attach cordboard lining to the card to make it thicker.
I would spend more money and buy more durable quality game.",3.0
Spacious and fun. Only complaint is that the netting is secured by Velcro - won't keep the baby in or keep the big kids out. Not to mention the amount of sand that got stuck in there.,3.0

This product could be so much better if not made so cheaply. Some of the numbers are wearing off. I have to use a marker to fill in the worn out numbers.

"I had one of these as a child. The concept is really fun! My kids (1st and 2nd grade - and even their 3 year old brother) like it a lot. The only really bad thing is the number problems are starting to wear off. We used it for a day or two before it happened, but their fingers pushing the buttons (which is what the toy is designed to do) have worn off the math problems rendering the toy pretty much useless.  Too bad. It was a really fun idea! I'll probably go back and rewrite with a sharpie then cover with clear fingernail polish, but really? The one I had as a kid lasted for years and years!",3.0
What I did not like is the fact that you have to pay another $8 besides providing the voucher. I wrote the company months ago whenever I initially got the product and voice my concern about their lack of openly providing the information. With an all of the information on a multitude of postings they have and one small section did I find this hidden $8 fee.,3.0
Came in great timing. I remember these when I was a kid but you really have to push hard on numbers to see answer! Still great,3.0

"Hello All. So I must admit I broke my own rule that I regularly tell me wife when she gets something from Amazon that's not what she expected. ""Always read the details of the item"" I tell her. Well, for once I didn't. I was told by other parents of this kit and excitedly snagged it, on Amazon of course. Was a little frustrated to find I paid $18 for a mesh bag/cage and a pamphlet. The stars of the show, the caterpillars, need to be ordered online separately for the low, low cost of only another $8 for ""shipping"". Not surprisingly, they ""highly recommend"" paying for the $15 or $28 shipping costs to get them a day faster. My fault for not reading the fine details.

If it winds up being amazing for my son, I'll consider upgrading the rating, but as of now, I feel this is excessive for what you get. And to think they market this to teachers who God Bless their hearts are certainly not overpaid as it is.",3.0

For us it wasn't a big deal since we found quite a few monarch caterpillars in the back yard.,3.0

Got this for my son to practice on unfortunately the answers underneath are very dim and hard to read.,3.0
I just recieved this today. I was very excited about this product. It is exactly how I remember this from elementary school in my days.  The only complaint is that when you press down on the button to reveal the answer it is hard to see the answer.  My daugher holds it close to her to see.  I feel bad for purchasing it but I was desperate to find something that will help her with her multiplication.  I looked at other products similar to this and notice everyone complains about the same thing with others products like this.  Before my daughter used it I asked her if it was too difficult for her to read and gave her the option to send it back....she said she was fine with it.  My husband said its probably better that its hard to see that way she won't easily cheat (lol whatever that means).  I guess for a product that is $11 I can't really complain.,3.0

"This tent is easy to put together and take apart. It fits nearly back into it's carrying case also. It is decent material and holds up okay.

I had to leave it unzipped a little and put my foot inside in order to keep him from floating off down the beach. It needs an anchor really bad.",3.0

Also, two of our 5 never emerged from their cocoons and another one came out with a bad wing and would end up struggling on his back.  So we had many tears from four compassionate girls and only two butterflies that we could joyfully watch fly away.

"Perhaps 13 years ago, my aunt gave me a tunnel very similar to the Neon See-Me Connecting Tunnel for a Christmas present.  Its huge size made it the most inviting present under the tree, and I loved the prospect of being able to crawl, climb, and hide in my own little place.
When I did so, however, I found that the metal hoops that maintained its shape were very hard and hurt my hands and knees.  The lack of insulation between the metal and the interior of the tunnel made traveling through it or spending any length of time inside it very uncomfortable (even through a sleeping bag!), and the toy was soon relegated to the basement.
Also, though the tunnel was supposed to be collapsible, the wires were so stiff that it was extremely difficult to compress it back to the size of the box it came in, which caused much frustration and difficulty in storage.
The idea of a six-foot tunnel is still as enticing as ever, and the tunnel I received and the See-Me tunnel are not exactly alike, but I would still recommend parents test this one out at a local toy store to see if the wires are protected enough for a child to be comfortable and happy inside.",3.0
It was given as a gift - unfortunately I've not received any feedback on its usefulness / effectiveness.,3.0
"This is a great kit and my kids have loved the experience of growing butterflies for several years.  However, I was sure the old kits included vouchers that did not require extra shipping and handling costs.

"My daughter received this toy as a gift when she was about one year old. She enjoyed pulling the string and hearing the ""quacks"". However she was at the age (still is) where almost all toys go in her mouth. Right after she was playing with it I noticed a little orange on her cheek. I looked at the toy and sure enough some of the paint had chipped off. I immediately gave it back to the gift giver and she returned it!

"This toy arrived on time and looks like the photo.  However, maybe I just assumed that it was an electronic toy and would provide a sounding response with the answers when you push the buttons, but it doesn't.  When you push the buttons, you can vaguely see the answers underneath the top button, but if you don't have good lighting, the answers are very hard to see and not easy for a young child to distinguish.

I found the advertisement misleading for the following reasons:
1. It states ""push the button to reveal the correct answer,"" but it doesn't state that it is not electronic or explain how the answers are revealed.

2.  It states ""no batteries required"" and that is usually only stated on electronic toys.

I was disappointed in this toy because as annoying as electronic devices can be for adults, pushing buttons with sounds would have kept my boy a lot more interested.",3.0

I still have my habitat, but I think I will be taking this year off from butterflies.  On the plus side, all of our caterpillars turned into butterflies!  We even had one that apparently wanted to be our pet--it refused to leave the habitat on several occasions before finally flying free.",3.0

"No batteries. No fancy attachments. Just a multiplication table.

The main problem: Your kid will need good light and a firm press to get the answer to display through the clear buttons.  It would *almost* be easier for them to use a calculator but I'm still glad I have this if only to get him used to thinking in terms of it being a multiplication table.",3.0
"I know of many people that have used the same product over the last 20 years to learn their multiplication facts.

"Pros: Quick and easy set up. Pretty design, Nice pad for bottom. The screen is a great weight to let the breeze in, but keep bugs and sand out. Cons: Velcro closure should be a zipper, or at least have more Velcro to create a better seal. It didn't keep out gnats, and they were all over the inside of the tent after an afternoon on the beach. (I'll sew on more Velcro myself to make this tent more useable.) Be careful, because if the Velcro touches the screen, it will create little picks on it. This didn't cause the screen to rip, but probably will eventually if I'm not careful with it. The tent also needs anchors. I put my little one's beach bag inside the tent with her to weigh it down, but that meant less space for her to play in. We had to be sure that if my daughter and her beach bag were not inside the tent, we had to put something else in there to keep it from blowing away. Maybe I can figure out how to sew on some anchors? Overall, it is a nice tent, but with a few modifications, it would be a great tent, with a 5 star review!!",3.0

We love this game and spung for the Deluxe version. If I had spent a bit more the jumbo version would be the way to go since my eyes get pretty blurry after an hour of searching for a card sequence. The images could be a lot more clearer in my opinion.,3.0
"We purchased this tent for our beach vacation for our six month old.  Overall, it was the perfect size for one baby to sleep in on the beach, set up was super easy and the mat was just cushy enough to be comfortable for a baby. Just in case someone is interested, it is not big enough for kids to play in...you MAY be able to fit two toddlers if they sat still to eat lunch, but they would have to be small toddlers. The closure is Velcro, not a zipper, so it does not keep bugs out.  Also, there was no anchor loops/hard wear meaning we had to put something heavy in the tent so it wouldn't blow away when we took our baby out. The spring loaded thin fiberglass support beams broke our first time taking it down. We were not the ones to take it down, someone in our family did, so it could have been user error - but I find it hard to believe that someone broke it that easily. All in all, served purpose, decent basic tent for an infant...but we only got to use once before it broke.  If we hear back from manufacturer we will update this post.",3.0
Good beach tent once assembled but it is a little tricky trying to put it together the first time. You need to put the rods together as poles first and then bend them as you insert through the loops - do not let the rods disconnect or it's very hard to complete.  Could use a little weight but you can bury the edges in the sand so it doesn't blow away when not occupied.,3.0
"It's probably not even in the suggested age range, but we thought the baby might enjoy crawling through this tunnel. He did, but then he would try to stand and the tunnel would start rolling -- not very safe. Of course didn't have it attached to a tent, so that could improve things. Just a word of caution.",3.0
"my kids like playing in this tunnel, but I have a real problem with one aspect.  the plastic coils that give it shape are uncomfortable to crawl on and hurts the kids knees.  I think this would work better if we had really soft fluffy carpet, but we don't.  As such, we don't really use it.  I wish we could.  the kids do have fun with it until they complain about their legs hurting afterwards.",3.0
It does what its supposed to do but its hard to see the answers through the plastic when u push it,3.0
"This would be great for kids trying to learn multiplication tables, but it's really hard to see the answer even when you push the button all the way down - because the transparency of the plastic is pretty poor.  It affects the functionality pretty badly because you can barely see the answer on some of the boxes.",3.0
"The eggs are a little hard to open & the carton cracks easy if dropped, but good for the price.",3.0
The eggs are difficult to open.,3.0
The tunnel itself is fine. There is no padding inside where the rings are. I do like the end panels that have see-through mesh. I think the price is to high for the quality of product.,3.0
Decent play tent. Wish it had a zipper for the screen door instead of velcro.,3.0
"Bought this for my son's lumberjack themed party. It was missing pieces and didn't come stained as in the picture. The wood pieces are more raw and unfinished looking, not the dark wood color pictured on the box. It worked fine and we'll keep it, but if I could do over I would have bought Lincoln Logs.",3.0
"First off since this was the first thing I wanted to know

THESE DO FIT REGULAR LINCOLN LOGS....BUT.... They are smaller than regular lincoln logs so when combining the two you will have a tighter structure. It ends up adding to the stability.

Good - For the price, this is an excellent set. It comes with a lot of pieces, roof pieces, and 8 to 10 of the long logs. I say 8 to 10 because of the bad

Bad - According to the instructions in the manual to build the log cabin you need 8 long pieces and 2 long half cut pieces. Unfortunately mine was missing 2 of the long pieces and 1 of the half cut pieces. Luckily I have the other lincoln logs to compensate. Also, nobody else as pointed out that these logs are ROUND ALL AROUND. They do not have the flat side like regular lincoln logs making it difficult to build on anything but carpet.",3.0
"$78.00 for a plastic toy? I'm sorry but this is too much money to spend. I can by 3 programs for my computer at this price. It was $10 when I was a child.
-Disappointed",3.0
"Good solid product and does the job. No factual errors as far as I can see, but I haven't completed the game yet.

The shell has stood up to serous toddler play without any issues. The main areas of improvement is that the numbers, when depressed, are not as easily readable as it could be. My  kids sometimes have a hard time telling 6s from 8s through the plastic.",3.0
"We were disappointed that there were not enough 3-notched logs to finish the instruction picture enclosed with the box, and seems way too heavy on the single notched pieces (not fond of parents traps where you have to buy several sets to ""make the most"" out of anything. We skipped the instruction page and from then on we had fun with them.",3.0
Six-year old and three-year old not as interested as I thought they would be.  A more substantial container to keep the logs in would be better.,3.0
"Great game, but when I ordered the deluxe I thought the game board would be large, but it is not it would be great for 2 people on a small table.",3.0
"I bought this for my kids remembering how fun it was when I was little. However, the picture makes it look so much bigger than it really is. My son can barely fit without feeling claustrophobic. I think they played with it once.",3.0
"Great price, decent size, enough airflow on hot days. It would be very helpful if it came with stakes because it will definitely blow away with the beach wind if there isn't something in it.",3.0
"Hmmm, I read the reviews and bought it anyway, it's not a great as I remember. I could have printed off a study grid for my daughter and it would have been as if not more effective. it is VERY hard to see the answers.",3.0
Same as with the Pluses and Minuses tablet. The answers are difficult to see when you press the buttons. Would still recommend.,3.0
These where not what I remembered having as a child but then again what is. These where easily breakable and some didn't even come with correct notches in them to properly build houses and what not. We where not impressed at all. You get what you pay for.,3.0
some pieces do not fit well together,3.0
"Bought this for my grandchildren to play with when they visit. A nice set, but one of the two special logs needed for building a roof was missing, and one of the roof planks was warped. The kids were disappointed when their log cabin couldn't be finished, and so was I. Getting the set replaced; hope the next one's complete, and the roof pieces aren't defective. Otherwise, the quality wasn't bad.",3.0
"While my grandaughter loves to play with thsee eggs, they are too difficult to pull apart and the toy. Arten looks like it's going to break easily enough.  I gave it 3 stars because of the difficulty of pulling apart.  But it's still a good toy for your little ones!",3.0
"To view answers you must press really HARD to see numbers.  It's almost like to plastic buttons are too thick or need to be more translucent in order to view the numbers more clearly.  Overall, the quality seems to be good.",3.0
"I had one of these growin up an it helped me a lot, but this one is not easy to read the answer... They just don't make thing the way they use to.",3.0
Got this to put my sun in outside the sleeves that hold the poles are shredding after about a months use. We quit using it anyways because my sun is crawling now and tips the tent over trying to escape.,3.0
"They are blotchy and not uniform in color and have some splinters. But my kids have never had the real deal, so they don't know what they're missing.",3.0
"Not what I remembered similar logs being. Slippery and hard to use for my child. Ended up in a box, neglected. Maybe in 2 years (age 5 then)?",3.0
They don't give you enough pieces to build the house they show in the picture on the box or in the instructions.,3.0
"My Grandma has some original Lincoln Logs and my kids really enjoy playing with those when we visit.  So, when these went on sale we decided to get some.  We purchased two sets so we would have plenty of pieces to be creative with our buildings.

Overall this product does what we need it to do.  But to be honest the quality is subpar.  It's still a great toy, but some of the pieces don't have a precise cut or consistent sizes so your log cabin might end up a bit skiwampus.  Also the finish on the pieces is thin and ideally would have a second coat or a higher quality stain.  Again, they get the job done, just don't expect 5-star quality.",3.0
Instructions are not correct.  Package includes 8-3 notched long logs. Picture on the box shows needing 8 but the instructions shows you need 10.,3.0
The container is very hard to open. I like the eggs but I wouldn't buy again.,3.0
As in other reviews it is difficult to see the answer.  The answer should have been placed higher in the square.  Be sure you have good lighting to use for it to be somewhat effective.  It is durable for the car and good for trips as long as there is adequate daylight.,3.0
My son wanted this for Christmas but very dissapointed as the answers are very hard to read when you press down on the butons. He still likes but very annoying.,3.0
"We have a new baby and our kids love to be by the pool in the summer so we got this to provide shade. Our infant's bouncy seat fits inside with plenty of room and we are able to keep her out of the direct sunlight and free up our hands. My only complaint is that on warm days it gets very hot inside the tent, even in the shade; a fair amount warmer than it is outside, even with the mesh sides. Otherwise we like this, and the velcro front opening does a good job of keeping the bugs out.",3.0
"I used this during Memorial weekend at the beach. Overall I like the product. It was a little challenging to put the tent up by myself, but I was able to do it with some frustration. When the baby wasn't in it, I had to put something in the tent so it wouldn't blow away. Keep in mind it wasn't that windy. I like the fact the tent was very light to throw into a bag. I will be bringing this when I go to Lake Tahoe since it doesn't take a lot of space in the luggage and it's not heavy at all, I do hate that there is no padding on the bottom of the tent. I had a blanket that I used before laying the baby down, I'll prob look for a soft mat or something so the baby is more comfortable. Can't beat the price though. Oh, I was able to be in the tent with my bsby. She also fell asleep in the tent. I would recommend the manufacturer to add some printed animals inside the tent or add little hooks so patents csn attach toys to keep bsby entertained!",3.0
ok,3.0
"Difficult to put together even for adults.  It took my mechanic husband about 20 minutes to build the house on the box.  I would not recommend this for children easily frustrated.  114 sounds like a lot of logs, but they are mostly the small size.  The kids seemed to like the larger, easier to handle ones.  The delivery was very prompt though.",3.0
"We had a set of these years ago that we loved.  Many of the pieces were missing and we were thrilled to find another set.  They are as they appear in the picture with different shapes and colors inside each egg.  However they pale in comparison to the set we had before.  The case is flimsy and the puzzle eggs are poorly made.  Some of the eggs are difficult to separate and some will not stay together.
I would not order them again.",3.0
Delivery was as scheduled. The eggs are hard to get apart. I'm hoping they get easier once she's played with them for awhile.,3.0
"For the price, its worth it. But, the poles are cheap and the elastic that keeps the poles together is not very tight. (if you have ever put up a camping tent - these poles don't even come close!) I'm planning on taking this on vacation and probably leaving it there. Also, the velcro that wraps around the front door will snag the material if you don't have it exactly connected with the soft velcro.",3.0
Pleased with item overall,3.0
My two year old could take these apart and put these together just fine but could not close the case.  I also have a feeling the tap that keeps the case closed will fall off soon.  These are cute but he didn't continue to play with them.  I like toys that kids play with long-term.  He has other kitchen toys he prefers much more.,3.0
Buy a milkweed flower and don't waste your money,3.0
a little too stiff for teeny hands,3.0
"Nice idea, but the eggs are way too hard for little ones to open",3.0
I love this toy but the plastic case keeps cracking,3.0
Hard to set up on a windy beach and mesh sides allow in too much sun for infant needing shade.,3.0
"My 11 month old son likes this tunnel, however the coils every few inches are not padded and it gives him bruises!  I know it's the tunnel because I'm small enough to crawl thru it and I could feel the hardness- I also had bruises later.  Wish I hadn't thrown away the box or I'd go get my wasted [...] back.  Otherwise it would be a fun toy.",3.0
Ok,3.0
"I like the concept of this toy.  The problem is, the inserts came loose from the eggs.  I am able to re-glue them, but I think quality toys should not have to be repaired under normal circumstances.",3.0
"They are okay but they were advertised as Lincoln Logs and they are a facsimile.  I think it might be considered false advertising!  All  in all, they work for a youngster.",3.0
"The kit itself was great, however the habitat for the butterflies was a cardboard box that could easily get ruined instead of the reuseable mesh habitat pictured on the front of the box.  I specifically bought this particular kit because of that.  It's false advertising.",3.0
"This tent is decent quality and the pad for the floor is a nice touch. One big problem. If you get this tent with the intention if trapping your baby to keep out of sand or dirt at park, beach, or in yard, It will not. It is easily opened by baby with slight pressure by baby. It is closed with a few flimsy pieces if Velcro and should really be a zip shut design. We got this for her at the beach for shade and doe she wouldn't eat sand and once she realized she could push it open which was within five minutes of exploring the tent we literally had to scoot our chairs against the tent and hold the closure shut with our hands. After about ten minutes of this we gave up and decided this will just be a play tent. This will be the main problem with this tent unless your baby is not even crawling yet.",3.0
"I never cared much for Lincoln Logs when I was a kid, but I thought my kids might like them. You never know, right? But it seems the same thing is true now as it was when I was a kid: Lincoln Logs are great if you like building log cabins, and only log cabins. And my kids don't seem to be terribly excited about building log cabins. As to the toy itself, the pieces are not constructed very cleanly, so the pieces don't hold together very tight. It's a decent toy, I guess, but just not our brand of fun.",3.0
I think this was overpriced.  I also thought I was purchasing the original Linclon Logs. These were plastic. Wouldn't buy again.,3.0
"Product is fine. I felt duped because it did not come with the caterpillars. It does come with a coupon to purchase the caterpillars. But that's little compensation for an 8 year old opening a birthday present. Needless to say, she and I were unhappily surprised at the same time. I have since used it to catch a fly in my house, and set it free.",3.0
"My toddler grandson likes the eggs and identifying the shapes inside, but the two halves are VERY difficult to open, even for adults. Not sure the frustration level of trying to open the eggs is worth it.",3.0
The eggs are great but the carton is hard to close for small hands. I had to put them in a regular carton because they kept getting stuck in the one they came in.,3.0
"My 6 month old loves being outside so I decided to buy him something he can relax in whether at the lake or in the front yard. This tent was easy to put together and fits what I need it for. The only downside is the mat it comes with, its pretty flimsy and doesn't quite fit the bottom of the tent and is not what is pictured. It doesn't have stars on the bottom it's just plain green, which is not a big deal. I remember reading the description and it saying it had a carry case which I didn't get one so not sure if there was supposed to be but I just kept the box and when I need to transport it just load up the box which is thin and portable. Not quite what I expected but for the price and it's purpose it's just fine.",3.0
This tent is wonderful for our Grandchildren when we go to the beach.  My main complaint is the sturdiness of the poles that support the tent.  It is very east to break one during setup.  I doubt it will last more than one summer....if that.,3.0
Board is a little hard to read. Otherwise good!,3.0
"Worked well, BUT it does NOT come with the caterpillars. This is reason for three stars because I thought the kit was complete. You receive the first part and then HAVE to order the caterpillars SEPARATE and PAY another $8.00. They haven't hatched yet, so I can't say if it is success. but all caterpillars were alive, grew fast. Just wish for my daughter and me I would have known did not all come together.",3.0
"The concept of this toy is great...the sorting/matching and pretend play -- all of my kids 5, 4, and 1 love this toy. I do wish the quality of the product was better -- then I would give it 5 stars all the way. The case is filmsy, and more importantly the eggs are really hard to come apart - even for me. They don't always seem to align up right when you stick them together (for me) and I attribute it to poor quality.",3.0
"This is such a fun and amazing project that me and my seven year old did together. Its amazing to start with teeny tiny catepillars and see them turn in beautiful butterflies. The reason it gets 3 stars is i found it expensive. You buy the habitat for $17 and then wait for it in the mail. When you recieve it you then get a voucher for catepillars and spend $8 online to buy them, and have to wait for them to arrive. Its sad because if we want to do this again i will have to pay $15 plus shipping to buy more caterpillars.",3.0
My kids love watching the caterpillars grow and waiting for the butterflies and it's a great teaching tool. But... The voucher for the caterpillars doesn't include shipping so plan on paying another $7.95 to get them.,3.0
"I purchased this item to take on vacation so that my 9 month old could nap while on the beach. Unfortunately, this tent does not offer any UPF protection from the sun like many other tents I've found online.  The tent is easy to assemble, is attractive, and functional - just not for me.",3.0
It came with a little hole in it. I don't think its was worth $30 especially with the hole.....Thank you,3.0
I didn't realize you have to pay extra for the caterpillars. free voucher but $7.95 in shipping and handling,3.0
It is supposed to have padding for knees and hands. I don't see that. I think it is a bit flimsy and certainly not worth the asking price.,3.0
"Pros: Easy to assemble. Decent size. Floor cushion. Mesj vents on 3 sides, with the back of the tent covered. UV protection. Lightweight.

Cons: Appears to be made of cheap material. Does not stake into the ground. The mesh opening leaves small gaps when closed, giving bugs a chance to enter in the tent. The floor cushion is quite thin, however, this is one of the only play tents that provide a cushion.",3.0
"I wanted to ask a few questions before I purchase this item, does this tent have the mesh/net on all sides?",3.0
small,3.0
I bought this to protect my son while he napped on the beach. It worked really well but it was a but challenging to assemble,3.0
"I did a bit of research before I purchased this tent as well as read quite a few reviews. I finally settled on this. I promptly took it camping with us after recieving, It was handy for play reasons and is extremely durable. I would compare it to a cheaper version of an adult tent for quality sake. My only complaint would be that there's no way to zip the tent, lack of a zipper. Instead it seals with three strips of velcro, which doesn't work well when your camping. I would have liked to zip it. For this reason we mainly use this tent to keep goods such as food, or other camping items. It's not waterproof, but I hadn't expected it to be. It would be appropriate for a play toy as one would purchase it for.",3.0
"It is easy to assemble and dissemble. Ingenious: sticks with elastic straps inside them.
It is fragile. The wind knocks if off immediately. My baby likes to stand up, and for doing that, he holds one of the walls and pushes himself onto it so that he can stand up. So, I have to sit him down every time he attempts this because he will fall over inside the tent making it to roll somehow. Lots of fun right there, but I did not buy this for this kind of fun.
It is very frugally made, but it is something you can carry easily, assemble easily, you can isolate your kid in to play with toys, even leave your kid sleep inside.
So, it is a an OK-Good item. It serves your purpose. Besides, the colors are fun, the fabric protects from sun (need to move that side after the sun).
I still have it, still use it, so, it is a good buy after all.",3.0
"When I ordered the Deluxe version of the game, I expected to get a large size playing board.",3.0
"Too early to tell - not butterfly season, yet!",3.0
In the manufacturer description it states this is UV rated. We just got this and nowhere on the box or in the manual does it say anything at all about any UV rating of any kind.,3.0
"I was very excited to use this tent at the lake and our horse barn. We spend A LOT of time outside. However, after setting it up inside for my daughter to get used to it, every time she pushed against it it would tip over! She is pulling up on everything and well on her way to walking, so I could see this happening way too often.",3.0
"This tent is easy to construct and holds togethers very well for the price. But I quickly discovered it was designed for younger, less active children than my 15 month old. First, she put all her toys into it and started pushing it over with one of her push cars, that seemed innocent enough, but before long she was in it herself pushing the walls and rolling around the playroom as if she was inside a giant gerbil ball. Foreseeable misuse? She also enjoyed pulling the poles out, so that she could wave them around and poke at things. If she could, my toddler would give this product five stars and title her review, ""Great Fun,"" but from a mommy's perspective, it was not safe. We had to take it down.",3.0
"I purchased this ten for my twin grandbabies.  I was disappointed that the tent is a bit flimsy and the seams tore open after just a bit of play.  They do, however love climbing through the tunnel.",3.0
"The description advertises, ""Additional mail-in certificates are available for order, so once you've released your butterflies, you can reuse the Butterfly Garden and experience the magic of metamorphosis again and again."" No such thing. After you pay the $7 and change for shipping for the first batch, you'd have to buy another cup of caterpillars, which costs more than the habitat! If I had known this, I would have bought the same net/habitat from ikea for $5 and bought two cups of caterpillars instead. Lame.",3.0
for a one time use it was great,3.0
Absoluyely loved it. 3 lived and became beautiful butterflies!  Will order again,3.0
"My wife and I bought this because we wanted to be able to see our kids when they are crawling through it. We figured that this way we could tell if they were 'up to no good'. When it arrived, we let our children began to play with it. They were a little hesitant to crawl into it at first, but we expected that. We then started placing them in there. They would just sit and look out at us instead of crawling through. We would lay down at the open end and call to them, but they just wouldn't move. Finally, I realized that they weren't really sure what to do BECAUSE they could see through it. I tossed a blanket over the top of it, and they instantly started crawling in and out of it without hesitation. I think that once they get the hang of it, we may no longer need the blanket, but that remains to be seen. In the meantime, I would recommend purchased one that is not see-through.",3.0
Somewhat,3.0
"this is very easy to set up.  Be careful and put a blanket or towel down,  because the plastic on the bottom gets very hot in the sun.",3.0
"its great, but the photo made me think that the board was going to be big! it wasn't :(",3.0
"It's just a pop up netted container.  I did not expect much more but was annoyed that the ""certificate"" to mail in for the butterflies and food requires $8.95 fee.  Not the $5 in the description of the product.  Upon further review of the product listing I see a $7.95 fee indicated (although the $5 is still on the listing as well).  Well mine just arrived and I need to pay another $8.95 to get the butterflies now....",3.0
Way too pricey for a bunch of plastic. My wife likes the game.,3.0
"During our annual trip to SoCal, our son was just starting to crawl at 7mos. I picked up this tent so he'd have some refuge from the sun and could nap inside.

I had also hoped he's be able to play as well, but half the time he was interested in pushing against the mesh walls, which withstood his efforts, but I don't think they would have if he was a month older.

This is definitely a good tent for the immobile or barely mobile baby to hang out in if you're on a beach vacation.

I suppose if you hold on to it long enough, it'll make for a good play area when they're a little older and don't want to pull up on everything.

Decent quality of construction and ease of portability.",3.0
"This tent is great for the price.  It is kind've a pain to put up though.  It is great for the kids to play with at home, but when we went to the beach, it took me 5 minutes to get it up and by that time I was so hot, sweaty and irritated.  It does not keep the sun out and it is very hot in there.  I would recommend it for a play room.",3.0
"The larger board is great but is hard to lay flat, has bumps in it & hard to keep the chips in place-I gave it away...
1 solution is I guess you could have it laminated or mounted to a board...",3.0
"We bought this tent for our 11 month old at the beach. We decided to try it out in the backyard while we did yard work and in his room to play in. It's as sturdy as you'd expect with tent poles. if you jump on the top it will probably break the poles, but the pockets that hold the ends of them are woven and sturdy. It keeps him out of the sun while allowing the breeze to cool him. My only complaint is that the door is shut with 5 pieces of velcrow, not very effective in keeping the bugs outor the baby in once they learn they can lean on the door and the velcrow would come apart.",3.0
"Very overpriced considering you still have to buy caterpillars, which they say you only pay S&H for, but that's where they get you.  Cool thing for kids though, just a bit overpriced.",3.0

"We used this tent in the Bahamas at the beach. It was good, and quick to set up when not windy.  Our son played in it for about 30 minutes and it kept the sun off of him.  It can be a little tipsy when he would stand up, but that's expected. Overall, I would recommend it.",3.0
"We purchased this beach canopy for a weekend getaway to Sanibel for our 3 month old son. It was great to have a place to lay him when he needed a nap on the beach and we didn't have to worry about him getting covered in sand or being eaten by mosquitoes. Once he can sit on his own it should be more fun...I love the zippered front so he can't escape once you get him in there(until he learns how to work a zipper!)Only drawbacks are that the roof of the tent is light yellow, so if your child is laying on his back he's being blinded by the sunlight that shines through. Also, the canopy does not have any sort of anchor to keep it from blowing away. It's usually very breeze on a Florida beach, and we had to keep the cooler or something heavy inside the tent to keep it from blowing away when or son wasn't inside. It's also magenta and yellow...not exactly neutral colors so it was kinda girly for our little boy. Over all, it did what we wanted it to do, and it was very simple to set up and take down. It was worth the money.",3.0
The instructions aren't clear. I've had a hard time with it. I introduced it to my 5 year old. It sit on a shelf untouched. Hopefully in a few months she'll work with it again. I think it's for an older 6 year old.,3.0

Too many tiny pieces to build something cool.,3.0
"I remember playing on a version of this game in my youth, so I bought this one for my kids.  It's just like the one I remember (still fun), but after some practice, it becomes too easy.

"My two year old son loves this toy. We set up a ""real"" model train set at Christmas, complete with village and he learned not to touch. When he saw this set at a model train expo, he was done for the day. My husband bought it and set it up for him. Little ones are going to try to touch while it is in motion, but with adult supervision, it keeps my son riveted and quiet for a good hour at a time. He snuck into the living room and took it apart. This is one that requires adult supervision with little ones. The balls get stuck and the train derails, but all in all it's a fun toy for all of us. Now he's hooked on Thomas!",3.0
"My 2 yr. old got this for Christmas and he just loves to watch Thomas and Terrence and Percey ""work"" unfortunalty it is NOT something he can be actually playing with.  This toy is entertaining, he enjoys watching it, but it is abandoned for the wooded set soon after.",3.0
"We got this toy for my son who turned 4.  He and his 3yr. old twin brothers loved watching this toy go around the track, however they kept wanting to grab it and interact with it, which just messed everything up and we had to put it back together again and again!  It is too irrisistable for them not want to touch it!  Also there are about 6 little black balls that kept getting lost because of all the grabing.  If you do not have all or most of the balls, then the whole point of this toy is lost!  Eventually a piece was lost that was critical to the operation of the toy and now it just sits in a sack up in the toy closet.",3.0
This product is a nice idea but when you go to send away for the caterpillars you have to pay a hefty shipping and handling fee on top of what you paid to purchase the product. It should all be included in one fee.,3.0
"I should have bought the Jumbo.  I thought this board was larger, but because of its size, it is busy and hard to find the cards to play.  I love the game and had played on the Jumbo board.  I much prefer that size to this one, and if I had realized the difference n size, I would have purchased the other game.",3.0
"This toy is a favorite in our house, but only when I have time to sit down and watch him play it.  Being only 3 1/2 he is not able to fix the trains himself when the come off-track. So mom has to come to the rescue.  This toy is more or less to just watch, if you want a more interactive toy look elsewhere.",3.0
"I bought this set for my three year old son who is a Thomas fanatic. He does enjoy watching the cars as they go around the track. The bad thing is that watching is about all you can do with this toy! If he happens to touch it it totally throws off the flow of the engine that goes around picking up the cars. This makes my son very angry and I have to stop what I'm doing and go and fix it. Also the little black balls that are supposed to be the rocks or coal or whatever are constantly getting lost. I think we have maybe 4 out of 10 left. This would be a great toy for a child who is content to just watch, but I don't know any children like that! If I did I would pack up this toy and take it to them!!!",3.0
"My three year old son loves watching the trains and ""scoop truck"" go around the track and do their various tasks. It is very facinating to watch, however, not alot of interactive play. The instructions are poor - at best - and requires a patient adult to learn how it goes together. If the engine comes off the track, it requires the same adult to get it back on task. Plan to spend the time with your child while s/he is playing with this. The little balls will definately get lost and they end up in parts of the track they shouldn't be in. The slightest bump makes the engine come off the track which means you have to constantly keep curious hands off the track. We were prepared for this because we had a similar item a few years ago so it was no surprise to us. As long as you are ready for what this toy requires, then you and your child will have fun watching it. The Thomas characters are adorable and very exciting to a ""fan"".",3.0
"My 3 year old loves this toy since he loves anything related to Thomas the train.  However, the tracks have a tendency to come apart with rather slight pressure, especially if my son leaned, sat or kneeled on the tracks as he played with the toy.  When this would happen, my son would become slightly frustrated since the tracks were quite difficult to snap together properly.  Overall, the toy is very entertaining and kids love watching the trains move the coal around the track.",3.0
"If I had realized it had velcro closures, about 10 inches apart, I would not have purchased this product, and did not realize I had clicked on the option to purchase with next day shipping until I received the confirmation email. Meanwhile I had found others I wanted, although more expensive. In print the Amazon site says no changes can be made on next day orders, so it arrived on time, as usual, but did not work for my purposes since it did not have a zipper closure. It has not been used but I paid as much for shipping as I did for the item, since I could not stop the shipment. I am otherwise very pleased with all other Amazon orders and shipments I have received.",3.0
"I agree with another review written my daughter is 15 months old and Toys R Us recommended this toy for ages 3-36 months so I got it for her to get in and use when I go to the beach in a couple of weeks.  I put it together to try it out and found out that the doors close with velcro.  I put my daughter in and within two minutes she was out, which I don't think will be much help on the beach wish it was a zipper instead. It is however a good idea for little babies, I went last year to the beach when she was only 7 months and had to cart around the pack and play which was a pain and getting it on the plane was a pain as well.",3.0
"A child under the age of 6 or 7 cannot play with this by his or herself. The plastic is rather cheap and not very sturdy when the product is built. The idea is wonderful, but I don't think this set or any of the other sets like this one are good for a smaller child. I refuse to purchase any other sets like this, and my child is the Thomas child!",3.0
"I purchased this set used, but in excellent condition.  My son is almost 2 and loves this train set!!  I have to agree with the reviews that complain about the ""no hands-on play"".  It is difficult for my son to just watch the engines do their thing and not interact.  He wants to be involved, but as I said, he still loves it and constantly wants my husband to set it up for him.  I am sure he may get bored with it eventually (as he gets older).  I think my husband enjoys it more! :)  One reviewer stated that it is difficult to set up according to the instructions.  My husband had no problem setting it up (and we didn't have the box to go by), but it does take a few tries to get it going smoothly and in the right directions to work.

Overall it is a neat toy, but kids may lose interest quickly.  It may be more exciting with the other set attached.",3.0
"My mom bought this for my son. It never really ran right, wouldn't stay on the track, & the pellets go everywhere. He would get frustrated & so did I. We put it away the first day & no one ever asked for it again, thank goodness.",3.0
This was a gift for a friend as they never made a comment about it i cannot give a review.,3.0
"Okay, so when I played with it I loved it. My two year old wasn't as enthusiastic until I shut off the motor.  Its got sort of a Rube Goldberg thing going for it. As everyone else has pointed out, there is NO interaction involved. In fact, it moves so fast that if you DO try to interact with it, you screw the whole thing up and it has to be reset.
I would say its more appropriate as a science educational toy vs. a way for kids to develop manipulative play skills (like the wooden set). There's so much going on here that older kids who have a capacity to comprenend its complexity will be able to sit with their parents and discover how everything works and how it does what it does.",3.0
"Both of my boys LOVE Thomas (they're 3 & 5).  My 3 yr old (then 2) received this last Christmas.  It was a nightmare to put together with the directions - took forever.  We were very disappointed to find that only one engine worked at a time and it's not interactive AT ALL.  All you can do is sit there and watch it.  Dollars would be better spent on the wooden railway which allows children to follow their imaginations anywhere.  This is great for kids who just like to sit and watch (yeah, right!) but if your kids actually like to play with it?  Avoid - go wooden!",3.0
"I bought this for my 2 year old son (for anyone under three take away the ""rocks"", as they are a choking hazard.  They are so tiny they get lost in 10 minutes anyway.)  Although we both have fun watching it, that's all you can do.  I get frustrated because half the time it needs to be repositioned to run properly, and my son gets frustrated because there's not much to do with the trains off the track.  It's a cute toy, but (coming from a mom & a preschool teacher) the $ can be better spent on a more interactive toy.",3.0
This is my second time using this product. Unfortunately one of the legs snapped. Such a shame and now I am not eligible for a return. It would be a lovely product if it didn't break.,3.0
"My 3 year old Thomas fan received this toy for Christmas.  Though it is fun to watch at first, it gets old quickly.  There is little interaction required.  Terrence is a weak link, and regularly gets the engine jammed.  Also, it isn't very sturdy, and is difficult to move without having to take the whole thing a part.  I was disappointed, as normally Thomas toys are such great learning tools as well.",3.0
"My 3 year old son is enthralled with Thomas, unfortunately, this installment in the Thomas toy line is quite over his head. I realize the box is labled for older children, but how many 8 year olds do you know who want Train toys?
The biggest problem I have with it is the fact that the battery operated motor for the trains moves incredibly fast, and if the other pieces aren't EXACTLY right on the tracks, the whole thing falls apart and I have to put it back together. My little boy wants to have hands-on play with his trains. Unfortunately, the only hands-on with THIS toy is fixing it so it will run...
Very confusing for both me and him... The only thing going for it is the price, but if I had to do it over again, I'd put my [money] on a more durable wooden set...",3.0
"It was not what I expected for a deluxe version of the game. Board was small, cards were skimpy and small.  For the money I paid I expected more.

Very honest treatment I do recommended it to all my friends best regards to the dealer and the site management,3.0

"Got it as a gift and didn't know that I need to add $5 to mail the butterfly larvae. So this butterfly garden ""kit"" comes with the net basket - that's it. VERY similar to a dorm laundry basket. Haven't tried it yet but i'm sure it will be a good experience for my child. The 3 stars is for the future experience with the butterflies. -2 stars for the inconvenience. My child was excited to see the gift and want to try it right away but had to wait.",3.0
"I own both the original game and now the deluxe game. I bought the deluxe game basically for the nicer playing chips. The mat on the other hand is cheap as can be. It does not like to lay flat and rolling it up is the only way to really store it.

Overall, I would recommend the original game, with the hard game board. Deluxe does not always mean better.",3.0
"A bit small, but my students loved it.",3.0
"Not impressed with the Deluxe Version.  Not much different from the regular version.  Only difference is a heavy duty vinyl mat with a non-skid back.  Here's the problem:  the mat, if you keep it stored in the game box, does not lie flat when you take it out.  I'm not sure why MSRP is twice that of the original version.",3.0
Really cool but the shipping on the butterflies is expensive if you want to make sure they arrive alive.,3.0
My grandchildren and I enjoyed the process.  can watch over and over.,3.0
"Great. No pegs, but knew that before I ordered.",3.0
I've now played this game 3 times in 3 different circumstances and everyone who did play had fun being competitive.  Easy to play after the first 5 minutes of getting used to seeing the board and remembering to pick up a new card after a play.  This is a fun after dinner game for all ages.,3.0
"As a teacher, I was very excited to share this experience with my class.
I was very disappointed to see one of the butterflies die in its cocoon.  Also another cocoon fell and the butterfly was not able to come out healthy.  It is still alive, however, the wings do not correctly open.  This was disappointing.",3.0
"The kids (2 & 4 years old) do enjoy playing the game, but they think it is really funny when the ice breaks, so they see who can make the bear fall the fastest.

"Controls for the front bucket are plastic, not sure how long they will last with my 3 year old grandson?",3.0
"I was under the assumption that this was a sturdy metal truck - it is not all metal.  It seems to be pretty sturdy but I notice that when my son leans on the loader handle move the truck around he has to be mindful of his balance - the truck tips over easily when moving it from this angle.  The scoop and handles are all plastic, but the bucket, arm, and body/frame are all made of metal.  The wheels are plastic too, not rubber like I had imagined.  If you are looking for one of those 'good ole' metal Tonka trucks - then you might be disappointed with Tonka's newer version of this classic toy.  They just don't make them like they used to! :(  Good news - my son (4 yrs old) does not seem to care - he has been loading and dumping legos and Matchbox cars since Christmas.",3.0
One of the hammers was broken,3.0
its a game that goes by quicly but my children really enjoyed it . I never played it before I purchased this game but the kids loved it,3.0
"Saw this game being used on a tv programme and thought it was a great idea.  Reviews were a bit hit and miss and I can understand why.  Takes quite a while to set up each game, squeezing the last cube into place is hard.  When you turn the block over and try to bang out cubes nearly always  more than one drops out.  Keeping strictly to your chosen cube doesn't make any difference.  The hammers were very light so again, kids had to keep banging a cube before it would drop out.  I also thought it was expensive.  The product is really flimsey.  Having said all this my grandkids enjoyed playing the game and trying not to knock the polar bear into the ice.  Wouldn't recommend.",3.0
"We purchased this for our son, but it is a little big frustrating for him.  It hinges in the center making it nearly impossible to push along, which is what he loves to do with trucks.  I think the time will come though when he will use it in the dirt and manipulate it the way it is intended.  Just be aware that if your little guy likes to push trucks, this one does not work like that.  It takes a bit of coordination, but I am confident that this will be a hit in the future.",3.0
Was pleased with watching the lifecycle amd the net to keep the butterflies in. Did not like how you had to reorder the larva seperately.,3.0

Gift for Christmas,4.0
"Really love this game personally, only problem is it's not an ""exciting game"" family or friends who aren't really into gaming tend to not enjoy it much. It's also not the kind of game that generates much conversation i.e. Monopoloy, Talisman, etc. It's a strategy game of sorts so it's not necessarily going to be a great conversation game, but it can sometimes make the game feel slow moving.",4.0
"I've been looking for a good board game for some time now, and after a lot of time spent on here looking through the games and reviews I settled on Ticket To Ride. Nice game! The packaging is quality. The pieces and cards were all in the package, and are also of good quality, though I did notice on a third shuffle that one of the playing cards had ""splt"" a little down the center. Initially the instructions looked a little daunting, but after a read through I realized that it wasn't going to be too difficult to pick up. We played with 3 players and kept the instruction booklet handy to use throughout the game when we had a question. The game is pretty basic, but I can see with more plays being able to figure out strategies for scoring more points. I'd go over the details of how to play, but it isn't appropriate for a product review. The game play was lively and we were able to talk about other things while playing the game. It lasted maybe 45 minutes, and I imagine that with more plays and really picking up the rules a session will last about 30 min. A good game to add to the collection.",4.0
Wouldn't be as fun with out the 1910 expansion pack added.,4.0
This was delivered very quickly and is a very fun game. I would definitely recommend it.,4.0
Great Game! Fun group game with lots of stratagey but a limited time frame,4.0
"My grandson and I had a lot of fun playing this game, we want to play it with his mom and dad.",4.0
"Great game! At $50 it does seem a little over priced. $35 is a good, fair price for this.",4.0
"Always a fun game. We love playing it with our family. I think we will be able to get many yeaes of use with this board game. Recently, we even talked to a family that printed their own miniature map to play while traveling.",4.0
"Meh the other version is way cooler. I know that I need to be grownup and sophisticated now but the colors are so much more fun. But blah, the blandness of this game made me want to cry. If you must, buy this but the original is better even if you have to buy the expansions.",4.0
"I love this game as do all the children who play it, but miss the colorful version they used to have.  All the cars and trucks were different colors and it made the game much more visually attractive.  It is still a wonderful game to teach children strategy while they are having fun.",4.0
Fun game. Cards are small and hard to hold. Buy the 1910 expansion and have the bigger cards. Glad I did.,4.0
"Very fun game... a little challenging until you get the hang of it, but once you do, it is a lot of fun.  Played with our 2 sons, ages 10 and 12 and they really liked it!  Great family game!  House rules had to be made so the game would move along quicker.",4.0
"We've played it only one time and at first, it seemed complicated but by the end of the game we really liked playing.  We are looking forward to playing it with a couple of friends.",4.0
"A fun, family game that incorporates various cities around the country.  So, you also incorporate some geography while playing.
We had to work through the rules a few times to make sure we had it right which is the only reason not a five star review.  As we're not frequent board game players, you may want to take that with a grain of salt.",4.0
"A classic tabletop game, simple to learn with tons of replay value. But the cards, ugh I didn't even open mine I just ordered the 1910 expansion and used those because my fat fingers cannot deal with those tiny cards.  I guess it can help the game fit on a table better but really blah!",4.0
"Once you get the hang of this game, it's pretty fun and easy to play. It's really confusing at first however. Give yourself at least an hour to carefully read the rules before you get into game play. Once we got going, it was a fun game for the whole family, ages 9 to 48.",4.0
"As noted in many of my other relevant game reviews, I'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance. She is what some would call a ""reluctant gamer"" whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to. She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session).

TTR is fun to play and easy to learn (in fact, the USA version is the simplest of the TTR franchise). The 1910 expansion is a must (updates some old components, and adds some new ones that are really worthwhile). The luck component is based on the train cards and destination tickets you randomly draw. The strategy component is based on what routes you try to complete, some of the card choices you make (they do not always have to be random), etc.

We liked the game so much that I eventually bought all four of the map collections (Asia, India & Switzerland, Africa, & Neederlands).  We don't own but have also played Nordic Countries, too.

The only reasons I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars are (1) the 1910 expansion is so essential that it really should have been included in the base game, and (2) once you've played this version a few times this particular map will start to feel a little simple.  Knowing what I know now I probably would have started with the Europe map and 1912 expansion instead (a little more to it at first, but lots more ways to grow into the game). But, this is still a great way to learn the game, and if you happen to be from the U.S. it will be a little easier to find the cities since you'll know where everything is.",4.0
great for all players of any skill type. Turns are streamlined which keeps the pace moving and are not too complex for beginners.,4.0
"I really enjoy playing Ticket to Ride! If you are a fan of Settlers of Catan and Macao, you will definitely enjoy this game. Ticket to Ride is fun for a couple of even a small group. It's easy to learn and explain to others. I would definitely recommend this game to friends and family!",4.0
"Ticket to Ride is a good family and/or friend game. Easy to learn, fun to play, and the pace is fast. Looking to add the '1910 add on' that introduces different game play and more destination cards. With four or five players I believe the game is best. A definite keeper.",4.0
"Ticket to ride is simple and fun. It is not too long and keeps people involved. This game involves making one of three simple decisions each turn. This makes the turns go very fast and keeps everyone involved. This game is fun for young kids, older folks, gamers, and non-gamers. I have played this with a group of board game folks and my inlaws. Each group also asked to play this game regularly.

The only reason this game get a 4 is because I feel the 1910 expansion is a must to play. It include normal sized card, instead of tiny cards, and it adds train route options.

This game lands itself as an instant classic.",4.0
"Fun game for the whole family! Takes a few rounds to play without having to think too hard. Enough detail to make playing often enjoyable. I have played this a few times with my husband and two sons (11 and 16). We have made a habit of playing family games at least every couple of weeks. Often we will play a game every evening during holiday breaks from school. I am impressed by this game and hope to purchase other Days of Wonder games in the future. They are a bit pricey, but much better than you average board game.",4.0
"I have played this game with both moderate sized groups and as a two player.  As you know good 2 player games are hard to find and may not adapt well to multiple players.  This game does well on both counts.

The play experience changes considerably with every player you add.  I enjoy it best with 3+ players.  Turns go quickly and you can play a 2 person game in under 30 minutes.

This game is easy to learn and explain, so it's ideal for adding a new player and for playing with older children.

One thing I enjoy about this game is that there is very little dependence on ""luck"".  You have the opportunity to make many decisions on each turn and these are what shape the game.  No dice!

Strongly recommend for anyone looking for a game that is engaging but not too intense.",4.0
"Super fun game. Very enjoyable for both larger and small groups. Be careful when using the ""block all of your opponents moves"" strategies against anyone you'd like to continue liking with. My sister did not appreciate the strategy and won't play the game with me anymore. Still very fun though!",4.0
This game was recommended by my nephew and we have only had the opportunity to play it once so we're looking forward to playing it again with more players!,4.0
This is a fun game. I am in graduate school and have found a new love for board games. This game is entertaining but the cards a small. I would recommend this for an older audience.,4.0
"In all truth, there's very little about this classic game that I can say that hasn't already been written more competently elsewhere.  Gameplay is fast, simple enough that all but the youngest children can grasp it within a few minutes, and yet deep enough that even serious boardgamers will find it very enjoyable.  It even includes spare pieces and a number count (so if you lose certain pieces you can find a substitute and still have the required number.)  Numerous expansions can keep the game fresh for years to come.

The only minor quibble is the huge size of the card deck, along with the decision to use 1/4 scale cards.  The tiny size can make dealing with a typical hand a bit awkward.  A full-size deck might add to the price, but would probably be worth it.  If it could be purchased separately, so much the better.",4.0
Simple set up and quick to play keeps the game rounds coming with this board game. The learning curve is almost non-existent. For the lovers of pure strategy this won't do much to sate those needs however for those looking for a new game to try with friends and newcomers to this style of game-play this will do well as an introduction.,4.0
"This is a great game for the Eurogamer to bring their non-gamer friends into playing your type of games. If you have friends or family who think of Monopoly or Trouble when they think of board games, this is a great game to ease them into the 21st century.",4.0
"This is such a great family night game and can also be played when having friends over for wine!

"This game is a fantastic game that I would recommend to anyone.

My only complaint is that I purchased the item brand new and the box came damaged. While I understand if I had bought this item used it should not have been damaged, it was brand new.",4.0
"I love this game! Everything game in mint condition and no missing pieces.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it only comes with 5 game pieces, which is a super weird amount considering most people play games in couples or pairs of people. I would of preferred 6 game pieces.",4.0
"This game is Loads of fun, and well worth the premium price. My only suggestion is that you purchase the expansion pack, because the cards that come with the base game are really small. The expansion set replaces those quirky little cards with standard size cards, and more of 'em.

Another fun option is to try buying the iOS version of this game first. It's only $5 and gives you a great feel for the game before diving in and spending $40-50 for the ""tangible"" version. I loved the iOS version so much i bought the ""real"" one here on amazon, and another one as a gift!",4.0
"Very entertaining and strategic board game. Great for ages 9 and up, for ages 8 and younger, it is difficult as the true concept of the game may be a tad complex.",4.0
"I bought this game as an ESL activity for elementary school kids in Japan. They absolutely love it. It's a great way to have fun while learning key vocabulary and American geography.

My criticism is that the game design seems a bit flawed. Players getting a high point east coast to west coast destination card seem to have a large advantage over players trying to complete a low point north to south destination route. This is due mostly to the layout of the board.

Still, the kids have never had so much fun. I've played this game with other adult friends and we had a lot of fun, though the winner usually seems to be the person who drew a high point destination card at the start.

I hear this game balance was solved in later editions, but as a person teaching U.S. English I felt I had no choice but to go with the U.S. version.

I'm happy with my purchase. In the end this is a fun game with a lot of education potential.",4.0
"This game involves both luck and strategy.  My sister-in-law, who doesn't like to play too many games (especially if they involve a lot of thinking) really likes this one.  It's funny that she does, since you do have to plan your moves wisely in order to build your routes successfully before getting shut out of areas you need by other players if their routes happen to intersect with yours.  There are multiple versions of TTR; each version adds some twist to claiming routes and/or scoring points.  This is the first TTR version, and it is the easiest one to learn the game on.  The most beautiful version of TTR is the Maerklin version. It's set in Germany, and is an homage to the Maerklin model trains.  The artwork of the boxcar cards in that version is superb.",4.0
My kids  had kids 8 and 11 and everyone enjoys this game.  Good family timeparent don't get board and kids have fun.,4.0
"An interesting strategy game that my family has quite enjoyed playing together for the month or so since obtaining it.

The first time playing was a little daunting, as it seemed like there were a lot of steps and rules to learn, but after a couple of rounds it all made sense and the real strategy (and fun) could begin.

Some people have mentioned that the cards are quite small; the cards are small, but I have not had difficulties in handling them so far.

As the title indicates, I found the newer version based in Europe to be a bit better than the original Ticket to Ride (based in the USA and Canada), because the European one seems to work better with larger groups, being less congested and having a few additional gameplay elements. However, I still would recommend Ticket to Ride to friends and I look forward  to playing it some more.",4.0
"Got this game for my birthday last year. I love it. Also got the addition Alvin and Dexter for it. Basically the game is a map of the USA with train routes connecting cities. You draw train routes (Omaha to Seattle, for example) and try to collect enough colored cards matching the color of the tracks. Usually, but not always, there are a few ways to get to your destinations which is a good thing since other players can block your progress. Nobody knows the routes you have and you can play anywhere you want even if you don't have any trip tickets for a route. We play this game at least once a week and everybody loves it. You can win a game on your second try. It doesn't take alot of extra learning to get better. Obviously you gain some experience playing more but that doesn't necessarily mean you will win. I gave it 4 stars because the cards that come with it are miniature. Don't know why they do this. I bought (maybe that is why they do it) an addition, 1910 which replaces the Trip tickets and train cards with normal sized cards. As mentioned above, I also got the Alvin and Dexter addition wehich adds some chaos to the game, which I love. That addition has to little non-discript chararcters which I detailed painted to make them look better. Some people love that addition others find it too stressful. I love it. Bottom line is Ticket to Ride is a great game and will be played for many years. Worth getting even with the little cards.",4.0
"I've enjoyed this game every time I've played.  The drawback is if you have 3 couples, you have to leave someone out because you can only play with five people.  We did play with 3 teams, 2 people on a team once, but I think it's more enjoyable to play your own cards and tracks.  We didn't purchase the expansion game yet, which I hear that more people can play with that version.",4.0

i was looking for new different games & this one was fun. i played at a friend's so I knew I would like it,4.0
"Great boardgame that I can play with my teens. Once you are an experienced player, it is best with three, but still an enjoyable game with two.",4.0
"enjoyable game changes each time, lots of fun for the whole family.  Luck, planning and thinking involved makes for a very exciting game",4.0
Our family really enjoys playing Ticket to Ride.  I bought it as a family gift for Christmas and we've played it several times.  It gets us away from the TV and doing something as a family.  Good purchase!,4.0
"Ticket to Ride is an interesting and stimulating game to play. It takes a while to play and would not be good for children who get bored quickly. I would not recommended it for those under 8 years. It is not frustrating or discouraging, but we found it challenging. Your departure and destination are determined by cards, the route is planned and embarked on, but others might block your route, causing a detour. It is a worthwhile game.",4.0
"This game, along with Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne, is one that I always use as a 'Gateway Game' to get friends and family who are not serious board gamers hooked on games.

Ticket to Ride is easy to teach and learn, fun to play over and over again, and doesn't take too long to get through (most games lasting under an hour).  The game doesn't suffer from a lot of random chance (e.g. no dice rolling) and relies on player planning and skill to win.  There is the option to go after other players and have a pretty cut-throat game, but that is not necessary to gameplay if it is not your style.

If you are already a big fan of board gaming but you haven't played any of the Ticket to Ride games, skip this one and go straight for Ticket to Ride Europe.  It has a few additional more complicated elements such as ferries and tunnels, and a more complex and congested map board.",4.0
"We play this as a family and all ages love it.  My wife is addicted and wants to play every night.  Good fun for the family or friends.  Does not take a long time to play and can either be a fun, non-competitive game, or you can play cut throat and interrupt other people's paths across the country.  Either way, fun every time we play it.",4.0
"We like the concept of the game.  However, we discovered we like the on-line app of the game so much better.",4.0
"This is a fun game and with the Untied States version, a great way to learn a little geography of the country.  It's good for different ages.",4.0
"Great game!

I play with my sisters and parents. A great game for people who like Risk. Its involves some strategy and some luck. Perfect combination for a random family game night.

However, I still think this would be a fun game for a serious gaming group. Super easy to pick up and learn.",4.0
"No matter how many players (from 2 to 5) you are, fun will be with you for more than one hour. Ticket to ride is a strategic board game that  wants you to link the higher number of cities (reported in your ticket cards) and once you think you are done you still need to have the longest train to gain the final bonus points. Watch out: your rivals could have your destination city, so be prepared for a sudden detour for not loosing points. Lucky is important though, but strategy is the key. I have tested it with my teen soon and with grandmas during holidays: all of us enjoyed with laughs, deep strategic thoughts, and thrilling moments! This is an ideal board game for families and for friends to play with. I am thinking to upgrade it with 1910 game expansion. Just two remarks: the editor should consider to use bigger size cards and wooden trains!",4.0
"Great game! Train enthusiasts will enjoy this one as we have over the past few days. Had a fun time playing it- our 13 yr old niece really took to it, surprising even her! It was nice to have her 'unplugged' for awhile. She was the one who wanted to play over & over again!",4.0
"Many times we have two other couples over, and not being able to play with six people is disappointing. Otherwise, great game.",4.0
Ticket to Ride is an interesting game that uses strategies to make it to your destinations. Love the competition of it.,4.0
I purchased this as a family gift for Christmas.  We played it on Christmas Day and twice since then.  It is easy to learn and fun to play.  My children enjoyed it as well as the adults in our home.  I think the age rating is right on. Anyone under 8 would have a hard time playing this game.  Worth the money!,4.0
"A friend of mine showed this to my wife and I and we thought it looked fun. I grew up on bad board games, or overplayed ones like Risk, so I was skeptical at first. My wife and I got really into it after the first time. This is a fairly simple game; collect matching color cards and try and get the largest individual sections, most routes, or longest route, in any combination you can. This game is not nearly as fun with only 2 people as you will likely never have a route fully broken; it is much easier to get to your destinations and to get all your routes to connect. The game really shines (and frustrates!) with 4 or 5 people. The rules and play of this truly are simple and there are not a large number of strategies with this original version. Supposedly there are expansions for different countries and for different rules. The randomness of the cards really prevents many long term strategies from working so you have to change this up often.

Cons - Well like I said I played this at a friends. His version had full sized cards like a normal set of playing cards. I bought mine at Barnes and Noble and for whatever reason, all the cards in my set are about half sized, like 2 x 3 inches. The printing on them is not as crisp and bright. The smaller size makes shuffling them a major pain. Otherwise the trains, the main board, and everything else is as it should be. In some ways the smaller cards makes playing the game easier to organize, but the quality of the printing is not as good.

Just curious, who has the bigger or smaller cards and which do they like better? I am thinking of calling the company and complaining because after playing on the big cards, the small ones really suck",4.0
"Got the game for the kids but we adults ended up playing it more then they did. Fun game that has a little learning curb as do all games. The more you play the quicker it moves along and when the kids played it, they actually have to think about strategy and make choices as to importance of move. Great learning tool and FUN!",4.0
It was easy to understand the directions - and the game flowed very well. I believe this rating will continue to go up as we get more proficient at it.,4.0
"This game was a bit complicated at first, but we caught on pretty quickly as we played.  3 adults and one 6 year old played over the holidays.  We had to guide the 6 yr. through the process at first, but he began to pick up the idea the more we played.  We all liked how it was different from any other game we'd played.",4.0
"I love this game because it is simple, yet strategic, and it doesn't take an hour just to set up or explain the rules. It has just enough strategy to make it a competitive game but you cans till relax and chat while you play.",4.0
"Ticket to Ride is easy to learn, fairly quick to play.  It is a great gateway game from traditional American games into the (to me) more fun world of Euro games.",4.0
"This is a great game for many ages.  I have played both this version and Europe, and this version is quicker to pick up bit just as fun.  I would recommend getting both so that you don't get to familiar with the routes and the strategy of other players.",4.0
This is a great strategy game this is easy to learn for anybody.  I would recommend 3+ people as it can get old quickly for only 2 people.  It is a great game to play over and over again.,4.0
"This is a great game for people who have a casual approach to table top.  I played it with my parents (who are in their 70s) and they had a pretty easy time picking it up and understanding it.  The game itself is a classic, with a very low time commitment and is very easy to pick up.

I also brought it with me to a table top group, and we all absolutely enjoyed it.  It's great for a starter before you commit to the three-hour RPG that you're slathering over but want to warm up for or are waiting on other people.

Haven't tried any of the expansions yet, but the base game seems to be enough.",4.0
"Great, easy to learn family game.  I prefer the europena version better as it has a little more to it than this game but both are excellent.",4.0
Pretty good game.  Less strategy than Settlers of Catan or Risk.  I would put in the same class as Carcassone.,4.0
Great gateway game components are build well not the aesthetically pleasing but still quite nice. I can easily play with my mom and my grandma or serious gamers and have a good time.,4.0
"This was a gift for my grandchildren and family.  I can't say they played it as much as I thought they would.  I enjoyed playing it once with them, but I don't think they enjoyed it as much as I did.  Maybe it was too evolved and they like quick action games..",4.0
"It's an interesting game, once you get the hang of it and start thinking of strategies to try.
If I could tweek a few things about it, I would make the train car cards bigger so they would be easier to shuffle,
and would probably eliminate the round the board point-keeping, and just keep score on paper.
In general, a good family game for maybe ages 10+, and educational for those who want to learn the rough location of
major US and southern Canadian cities.",4.0
"Ticket to Ride is the board game I most often reach for when I have family visiting. For the middle-school aged nephews and the ""hard to teach an old dog new tricks"" crowd, Ticket to Ride is very easy to pick up on the rules.

And those rules? They can be boiled down to ""It's like Gin Rummy ... with little plastic trains"". Collect cards of matching color sets, then use those sets to claim your tracks to connect cities into a grand network. But watch out for your fellow railbarons, who might have designs for that Los Angeles to El Paso route!

Even though I also play quite complex and multi-layered board games, I've never not had fun with Ticket to Ride. It plays quickly, and even the slowest to learn players pick up on how to do well in just a couple rounds.",4.0
"It was a gift, and the receiver loves this game.  I've played it and it is a bit ""involved"" but fun, none the less.",4.0
"I bought this for my parents before a recent trip to Hawaii with the family. We played it almost every night, and it went over very well. It is easy to pick up and has lots of replay value. The games last just long enough to feel satisfying, like a job well done.",4.0
Good game for nine year old boy.  The direction were a little hard to understand and I'm still not sure we played it the was it was intended but had fun anyway.,4.0
"I love this game and would give it a 5 star rating, but this set comes with REALLY tiny cards.  I couldn't find this anywhere in the description.  I have played other versions of this game and never ran into these small cards.  It's not a deal breaker, but it's really annoying while playing.  Just know what you are getting.  I haven't measured, but the cards are something like 1.25 inches wide by 2.5 inches tall... something like this.",4.0
"This is a great game.  Most people can learn in very quickly, but it is interesting enough to want to play again.",4.0
"fun game. not very challenging, but it is better with more players. Would be great for kids to learn the geography of the U.S.",4.0
"I have played this with kids and adults, it really is fun for all ages. I feel like kids pick it up a little faster, but my aunts did pretty well the first time they played.",4.0
"We played the game and it was very easy to understand and the strategy was easy to figure out.
Highly recommended",4.0
"Takes a while to catch on, but a fun game. Scoring can be a challenge to master but I liked it.",4.0
My ONLY negative comment is that it is for 5 people maximum.  I'm thinking of making another color (out of balsa wood) so we can play a 6th person.  That way 3 couples can play.,4.0
"Good concept. Not too hard to learn, and always fun to be playing with trains and maps.  Much better with more than two players.",4.0
"Ticket to Ride is a really easy and simple game to pick up and learn, but if you don't have any of the expansions to add more complexity, it's almost to simple for its own good as the replay value is greatly diminished, but I still like to pull it out and play it every once in awhile.",4.0
"I saw this game on Table Top and figured I'd give it a try. It did not disappoint as I broke it out for game night with some friends. We had a blast playing and they've requested we bring it back for another round.

The only complaint I have about this game was that the instructions were not completely clear about several steps. Though I knew the answers to some of the questions from Table Top.",4.0
"The directions are a little bit like they've been translated back and forth from English a few times but after you play the game through once or twice you stop needing to look. Set up is actually the longest part. It's a pretty quick game, even with 4 players (2 adults, one 7yo and one 5.5yo) it's still only about an hour. It's fun, the kids like it. I question how much replayability it has in the long run; but then I suppose that's why they sell the expansion packs.",4.0
"This is an outstanding game that is also a teacher/learning tool. The original (small) cards are too small to use, which is why we bought the ""expansion.",4.0
"Very simple and fun game.  I thought it would be more complicated but it really is not.  They say the best things in life are simple, this game is simple.",4.0
"Quick and easy to learn, I've had fun playing with the rest of my family.  There's a bit of suspense as you try to sneakily connect lines without anyone noticing, and even when you're foiled, you're not out of the game.  Recommend for those looking for something new to try.",4.0
"This game is great for 3 or more players. When playing with only two people there isn't much competition for tracks and cities, each player can build their tracks independently and the game seems rather dull. During a 3 - 5 player game there is competition to see who can get the most popular routes and often players are forced to change their routes because of other players taking those tracks.",4.0
If you have never played this before I suggest you read rules online and watch the video. Only played this game once and after watching video discovered we played it wrong so the next time it will be more challenging.,4.0
I found this game recommended in the local paper and it suited my need for a gift for a typical non-communicative teenager.  Our family played the game with him Cmas Day and I saw him actually smile.  I think it was a hit.,4.0
"I didn't think that I was going to like this game going into it, because the game is about building train routes and not very complex. I was wrong. This game is just pure fun to play.

There's nothing like working towards a specific goal with no idea if it will all pan out in the end and then seeing your game long plans come together at the last minute. Actually completing those city to city route objectives was the source of the most satisfaction to me not necessarily scoring more points than my neighbor, which is rather refreshing in a game.

The game components were nice although the very small size of some of the cards stood out immediately. They are still workable for adult hands though. Some of my train pieces were chipped slightly and appeared to have some grime on them, which was odd. Also the game board itself didn't like to lay completely flat on the table.

Game component issues aside, this is a very fun yet simple game to play for the entire family.",4.0
"This is a fun game if you like more strategy oriented board games.  I would say it is 4.5 stars if possible, just a hair below monopoly, risk, and settlers of catan.",4.0
Have played the game before and decided I needed my own game.  Only thing that I did not like about the original game is the size of the train cards.  Lots of fun and more challenging when 5 play.  Would recommend.,4.0
"TTR is pretty much my goto game for any group of folks 'new' to modern adult board games:
-very simple gameplay - draw some cards, play some matching cards, put trains on the board, lather rinse repeat
-rules can be taught to even attention-deficited folk in a matter of minutes. No long boring recitation of rules. Just unpack start playing and explain while executing first turn(s).
-while simple to play/teach, there is enough strategy in the game to keep more experienced players 'in' the game
-short play time and quick turns prevents new players from becoming bored and losing interest. Also permits firing up an immediate second game if the first go is a hit.",4.0
"I gave this game to my daughter, her husband, and their children (5 and 8) for Christmas.  The five year old needs help playing, but the eight year old quickly grasped the concepts and began strategizing her play.  We adults loved it, also--a challenging game that lets the whole family participate.  A game can be completed in an hour to ninety minutes, and offers the opportunity to learn about geography and history while having fun.  The elements of the game (plastic railroad cars, playing cards, and scoring tokens) can be a bit overshelming, so it is important to stay  organized.",4.0
We like this game.  It's easier to play online because there are so many pieces.  We don't play often.  It does get a bit boring if you play too often with friends and family.  If you play with the same people and the same board you just get to know their strategies.,4.0
"I bought this game after playing it with some friends.  Some find it boring, but I found it quite entertaining.  And my kids even can, and love to play.",4.0
"I purchased this for my 11 year old grandson for Christmas.  After he opened it, he turned the box every which way, I suppose looking for an electronic device of some sort.  But I think once he, my son (his daddy) and my granddaughter start playing this game, they will love it because they like competition games and learning games, and I believe from all the reviews I read that this game will fit the bill.  I am happy I got this for him.",4.0
"great for the whole family and new gamers. I would consider it a ""gateway"" game for other games like settlers, carcassonne, and 7 wonders.",4.0
"I bought this game without having ever played it, basing my purchase on favorable online reviews and positive mentions here and there from others who also enjoy board games. I've played with 2 players a couple of times and 4 players once, and everybody I've played with seems to agree that this is a pretty fun game. The strategy is definitely kicked up the more players you have, since you obviously have more people competing for a finite number of routes.",4.0
Just discovered this game a couple years ago and it is very fun and addicting! Great for game nights with friends!,4.0
This is a fun game for families or casual game players.  It has a fun premise of trying to build out a rail network to collect the most points.  There is not much strategy involved as it is much more oriented toward random distribution of the cards.  That said for a 45 minute game it is fun!,4.0
"We liked the game Ticket to Ride because of the strategies involved in being the winner. If all players pay attention, the game can move very quickly; which we think is a big plus. It is not quite a classic as Monopoly, but very good indeed.",4.0
"It's great to have a new game on the market.  I had fun playing this game with my son and two of his children.  I liked that a map of the US was the playing board and the concept involved connecting two cities by rail.  The game involved some strategy and some luck.  As with many board games, the pieces can be disrupted easily if the board is bumped (by a baby brother in my case).",4.0
"I am sure the fact that I won decisively the first time we played has Nothing to do with my positive feelings about this game! :)
Seriously, though, it's a fun play for a group of 4 or 5 adults.  Relatively quick and easy to understand, but with enough chance that the smartest guy at the table (i.e. my husband) may not win 80% of the time like he does in many other games.  There are also enough hidden point multipliers that the winner may not be apparent until the game is nearly over, which helps those who seem to be trailing keep up their interest.  I am sure we'll be playing this for many weekends to come.",4.0
This game was fun but hasn't been played much in he year that we've had it.  Not sure why.  Educational.,4.0
"Each holiday season Santa leaves our family a new game to play despite the fact that no one actually believes he exists.  This year he left Ticket to Ride.  The kids (ages 8-16) greatly enjoy the game and caught on quickly to the rules and strategies behind the game.  They are now asking for the Europe version.

I appreciate the fast pace of the game.  Even with five players an entire round through the players can take less than a minute.  This makes the game play relatively fast.",4.0
"My wife and I were introduced to this game by some friends and really liked it right out of the gate.  We got our own copy and have been playing a lot and have introduced it to our weekly game group, so now we are taking a break from Dominion and have been playing this.  Everyone loves it and we are going to start teaching our friend's 5 year old how to play as well.  I found some ""rules"" online for making it easier on kids so we look forward to all enjoying it for some time to come.",4.0
"We received this game for Christmas, and have played it several times since.  My seven year old really enjoys it, and the adults do as well.  The game is easy to learn and is set up so that you never really know who has won until the end.  The different ""destinations"" everyone is trying to reach really spreads the game out at the beginning, and allows for different strategies.  I like how different it is every time you play, and also that it doesn't take hours to finish.  It also is more of a thinking game than a aggressive game, and it has a nice pace to it.  We have found that a game lasts around 45 minutes.

The only complaint I have is that it take a while to add up the points at the end, and it is very easy to make mistakes.  The game is structured so that longer tracks have a much larger reward, but it means adding up a lot of odd numbers.  There is a numbered area at the edge of the board to keep track as you go, but it is easy to forget a track, so you really need to add it all up after.",4.0
"Fun game.  Has some strategic thinking, some luck of the draw.  Can be played by just two people or with a larger group.",4.0
"There is a reason that ""Ticket to Ride"" has sold over 2 million copies and has won numerous awards in several countries. I had not even heard of this board game until recently but after receiving it from Amazon last week our whole family became addicted and we have played it almost every day.  It's simple enough so that young children can learn it but has enough strategy that there are entire web sites dedicated to playing it more thoughtfully.  It really is a great game.

The only negative aspect is the high cost.  I bought it from Amazon and that was still expensive.  Ebay and others want between $40-$50 for it.  It's just a board, cards, and plastic pieces - no justification for the price.  If you can get past that - there are no other downsides.  I'm glad we bought it.",4.0
"This is really and truly engaging game, maybe not
right up there next to Monopoly. Does help get thier
geography skill/knowledge upto speed without them
knowing it !!!",4.0
"Purchased this product for 9-year-old who enjoys board and card games (Gamewright, Monopoly, etc.). Similar to Gamewright card games, this takes 1 or 2 games to learn all of the rules and start understanding the strategy. The game is a good combination of relatively simple rules and opportunities for strategy. I can tell that my daughter is picking up on the strategy and starting to think through game options. Game also provides a bit of geography (who knew that so many cities are difficult to pronounce?). Games take about 30 minutes.",4.0
"If you are a train lover (or just married to one, like I am), this is a fun game that has you building the most and/or longest train lines between US cities.

Raves:
1. Good educational value (math, geography).
2. Good balance between strategy and luck.
3. Allows up to six players but is equally fun with two.
4. Expansion packs allow you to explore Europe and other areas of the world.

Warnings:
1. There are a LOT of little game pieces.
2. Game play requires moderately sophisticated thinking; kids under 6 may find it too challenging.
3. This is not a quick game; our two-player games average 30-45 minutes.",4.0
"This is a great game that you can pretty much play right out of the box. No pouring over rules while you play either, once you understand the three or four mechanics in the game, you're ready to go!",4.0
"Ticket to Ride is a fun game that is easy to learn, but has plenty of strategy.  My only complaint is that the cards are a little small.  Makes them hard to shuffle.",4.0
Ticket to Ride is a great game whether an avid gamer or just a beginner.  It is not so complicated as to frustrate those less competitive but has great risk/reward for the serious.,4.0
"The game arrived quickly in perfect (new) condition.

Ticket to Ride is a great game for the casual or the serious gamer.  It is very simple to learn, but play can be quite complex due to competitive elements.  It has a great light feel such that you can still have a conversation while playing without feeling you have to concentrate overly much on the game.  That said, if you want to concentrate and strategize, there is still plenty of that to be done.  This game is ideal for a board-gamer like me: a serious gamer who mostly plays with casual gamers, since it appeals to both.

Overall, it is very fun and has great replay-ability.  Good buy; I would buy it again!",4.0
"Ticket to Ride is a decent train game.  It comes with a HUGE board, so be prepared to play on a large table or on the floor.  Lots of little plastic trains, brightly colored, nice graphics.  Game uses small cards, two separate decks, destination tickets and train cards(same size).  Mechanics are simple--take one action (draw 3 destination tickets and keep 1 or more, draw two train cards, or use the train cards you already have to claim a route) and score it (if it scores).  You then compete with your opponent(s) to build the longest route, score the highest points, and connect all of the cities shown on your destination ticket(s).  It's easy to get caught up in finishing routes on the tickets, though.  You can end up pulling lots of train cards trying to get enough of one color instead of building routes and scoring along the way--potentially losing you the lead (especially if your opponent(s) block your way).  Also, if you don't finish a mission, it will detract from your points at the end of the game.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fairly laid-back game with simple mechanics.  If you're looking for a lot of excitement and super-fast gameplay, this might not be the product for you.  It is, however, a reasonably quick game.",4.0
"Since this is a board game not a toy, I have not given this game 5 stars in all the categories.  Given the game has cards it is hard to tell how long they will be good.  The game is very entertaining to play, but will take some time to master.  This is a game that takes awhile to play and should not be hurried.",4.0
Played game at a relatives & decided to buy it. The cards are so much smaller than the game at my relatives.,4.0
We homeschool our kids and this game definitely helps with learning where many cities are in the US and southern Canada. This is my wife's favorite family game!,4.0
One of my favorite games of all time to play with the entire family.  Even the wife likes this one!,4.0
"Fun game but a few drawbacks:
1) Routes do not cover many cities and form predictable patterns for winning.
2) Small cards are difficult to handle and shuffle.
3) Some card colors are difficult to discern without bright lighting or if persons are color deficient.
Apparently the company later recognized these problems and corrected them in an ""expansion pack.""  The expansion pack is fine for previous versions but newer/current versions should be sold with the corrections in the first place!  Why pay MORE for an inferior product and then the upgrade?!?  Duh, I just answered my own question.  ;-)",4.0
Ticket to Ride is a great game for two or five players. We laugh a lot and it dosen't take all day to play.,4.0
We enjoyed Ticket to Ride with out children in Texas during Christmas break and ordered one as soon as we arrived home. It is a great combo of skill and chance.,4.0
"This is a fun, addictive game for adults especially. Probably a little hard for children under 10 due to the strategy component.",4.0
"First pulled it out, and the pieces are great. Very nice board, and awesome to set up. After reading the directions through one time, had to do a quick review so everyone understood, but once you get it, this game is a blast. My 2 daughters of 9 and 11 both loved it, and were excellent at playing. There is a fine line between being too greedy and wanting to do more, and completing what you have already... My 11 year old won the game, so all can enjoy the night... I have some planning to do for our next game night, as I hate to loose, even to my own kids...",4.0
"I got this for Christmas, and what a fun game. We played with a variety of people and age levels, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It isn't complicated, so even if you have younger people (or a lot older, for that matter), they'll be able to play with you. The game also takes a reasonable amount of time, meaning that it isn't very lengthy like Settlers or even Monopoly tends to be. You should be able to get a few rounds in during a game night with friends.",4.0
"Many small pieces.  Educational in that it teaches where cities are in the US and Canada. Slight confusion over the directions for 2 or 3 players using multiple routes between cities, which made it seem almost impossible to reach a destination.",4.0
"Excellent game! Lots of fun for many different ages! Teaches geography, stratagy, and math skills. I highly recommend this great game!",4.0
"Bought this for my son in law.  He already had the Nordic one. Really like this game as all four of us can play but, as others have said, will get the expansion soon as the cards are really small.  Otherwise, everything seems great and it has provided

"Not a game I constantly want to play, as it's fairly simple, but when we do play, it's enjoyable.  Very nice board, pieces, etc.",4.0
I first played this game with a friend who had it. I loved it so much that I went oline to buy it. It's a really fun game that is competitive but not too much. It doesn't take too long and you can play with two people!,4.0
Probably one of the best board games i have bought in recent past.  Got a good strategy feel without the learning curve.  Your friends who don't like strategy games too much are happy to play because of the simplicity of the game.  Good buy!,4.0
"Ticket to Ride is straightforward. Its one of those games where you never need to reference the rules after the first time you play it. Nonetheless, collecting the cards you need and creating your path around the country is surprisingly fun. The goal cards give the game a sense of purpose, and there is actually some strategy involved because of the interaction with other players' paths. Thus, although it is accessible to children (maybe as young as 8?) it is entertaining for adults as well.

The educational aspects are a bit of geography and simple addition.",4.0
I bought this game to play with my grandsons who are 8 & 10.  We had a great time playing it but my husband and I have enjoyed it too.  Good family game with lots of educational value because of the geography and because one needs to plan moves to succeed.,4.0
"My family loves it. I love it. Great bits. Nice big board. Easy to teach. Good balance of luck and strategy. My only real complaint is that once a route is built over, it leaves players blocked out. But I guess that's where the strategy comes in.",4.0
"Having played this game only once, I decided to invest in my own copy. The components are high quality, the game is aesthetically pleasing, and most of all it is fun for everyone. My only complaint is the small size of the cards that come with the original game.

The mechanics are simple and can easily be learned/explained to new players of all levels. Players collect cards, build railroads to connect cities, and accumulate points. At the end of the game - when one player has two or less railroad tokens left - the player with the most points wins.

The mechanics - limited choices and limited building options - create an exciting tension without much, or even any, direct conflict with other players. Because, the routes for which each player is responsible change during each game, there is a high level of replayability.

I have played this game nearly 15 times now and recommend it highly to anyone considering.",4.0
"Ticket to Ride takes a step away from Monopoly and Life without getting too complicated.  One game and you understand what's going on well enough to teach someone else.  The game has great depth and strategy.  It's design for two to five players does lead to varying play styles, since two players can play almost independently of each other, but five players will have to struggle against each other for routes.  The colored cards are a bit difficult for colorblind people to make out - but that is compenstated for by symbols unique to each color on each card.

All around fun and entertaining!",4.0
This game is fun for everyone. Even my father in law wanted to play and my 3 year old stayed busy playing with the extra trains.,4.0
"I first saw this game in the European version, with travel among various cities, perhaps needing to detour and at the same time have a geography lesson.  I almost got that one, but when I saw the U.S. one on Amazon.com, I thought it might be more appropriate for my 8-year-old grandson and it is.  Good fun for him, his parents, and grandparents.  Challenging, educational, and not tedious!  Recommend it hightly and look forward to getting the European one soon.  And I hope versions will be available for other continents.

And thanks to Amazon for having it available.

This is a great game that takes strategy and is easy to learn.  It does not take long to play which is great.,4.0
Ticket To Ride is a fun game for adults and older children.  There is strategy that develops the more that you play the game.,4.0
"This is a blast, and better for kids under 14. If all our kids were older, we'd get the European version. But this is less complicated, therefore more fun for younger ones.",4.0
"My 12 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas, even though she had never played it.  We tried to play as a family, but could not figure out the full game play from the included instructions.  The next day, I decided to look to see if there were any video instructions.  There was an excellent one on YouTube that explained all aspects of set up and game play, and made it very clear how to play, including various strategies.  That helped A LOT.  Before this point, we had never had difficulties learning how to play a game once we read through the instructions, so that was a downside to this one.  All that being said, now that we know how to play it is great fun, and I would like to buy more European games.",4.0

"Ticket to Ride is a fun game!  I have also played the Europe version, which is equally as fun, but it is hard to find cities in Europe since I've never been.  My boyfriend and I enjoy playing and competing for longest road.  All our friends that we have introduced to the game have fun with it and catch on quickly.  My only complaint is it's only up to 5 players.  Definitely recommend this game to everyone!",4.0
"I like the idea of a game, but I like Europe version much more than this one. Less relying on a lack and more on making decisions.",4.0
"This game is easy to learn and quickly fun, but we didn't stay into it very long and don't see us playing it long term.  I can see this forgotten within a year unfortunately.

We enjoy a game where there is some amount of conversation after the game about the strategies used and reasons for some decisions.  We don't find ourselves doing that much.

We like it for from 2 to 4 players, thinking 5 is too many. The game does change quite a bit with different numbers of players, which is nice (variety).

We think it has the right mix of luck and skill.  It can initially seem too luck based (draw bad cards), but you realize there are strategies to deal with that.

Quick to set up and put away, and well made.  Quick to play (less than an hour).

I suspect people who find Settlers of Catan and Dominion fun but too involved might like this.

The on-line version is great because it is so convenient.  It shows you the cities you need to connect which is really handy.  It is I think $10 per person for a life-time account.  When it's just my husband and I we prefer to sit with our laptops and play that way.
ALSO - you can try it before you buy it that way.  You can make an account for free and play 5 games.",4.0
"This is a great gateway game. If your looking for something not too difficult in order to introduce players into euro style board games, this wouldn't be a bad place to start. It's easy to get up and running and not too heavy on strategy but doesn't completely rely on luck of the draw. I think it would be great for family and friends alike.",4.0
"The USA version of Ticket To Ride is fun but frustratingly cutthroat; I would not recommend getting the base set without the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-1910-Expansion/dp/B000K8FYAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1910 Expansion</a>, which offers three superior variants, more tickets (routes) and regular sized playing cards to replace the tiny ones included in the base set. The main problem with the base set is that whoever builds the big northern routes usually wins, exacerbated by the awarding of a ""longest route"" ticket worth bonus points. The 1910 expansion offers you the choice of eliminating the longest route bonus and awarding a ""most routes completed"" bonus instead, or using both of them, or neither. That helps tailor the win condition to best suit the group.

However, I still prefer the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ticket-to-Ride-Europe/dp/B000809OAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ticket to Ride Europe</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-1912-Expansion/dp/B002OFLL7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1912 Expansion</a>&nbsp;because of it provides more interesting challenges (ferries and tunnels) and adds stations players can use to get around being cut off in completing their routes. These stations can easily be used in USA or other versions. Europe still has the ""longest route"" bonus points award but this is easier to get for everyone because if you have to use a station to complete a route ticket, it no longer counts toward your getting the longest route award.

Another excellent option over the USA version is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-To-Ride-Marklin/dp/B000EYF7RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Wonder Ticket To Ride - Marklin</a>&nbsp;(Germany) version that adds passengers you can use to score crazy bonus points that add a whole new strategy to the game; unlike the stations in Europe, however, the passenger mechanic is not easily integrated into other editions. Another nice thing about Marklin is that it offers the most balanced map with a near equal distribution of long and short routes which are split up on the left and right sides of the vertical map. With Marklin, completing a ton of short routes is just as viable a win strategy as long routes in the USA base sets.

Both Europe and Marklin also split your initial ticket allotment into long (blue-backed) and short (brown-backed) routes; you get to choose how many of each you want to do--unlike the USA base set, which is totally random in its ticket distribution (long routes are harder to complete but offer more bonus points to win than short routes).

I also enjoy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ticket-to-Ride-Switzerland-Map-Expansion/dp/B000WTDUZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ticket to Ride Switzerland Map Expansion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-Nordic-Countries-Board-Game/dp/B001E9641K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries Board Game</a>. Both Switzerland and Nordic Countries are designed for only 2-3 players, unlike the usual 2-5) so they are great options for smaller groups. They also offer the two most challenging maps.  Unfortunately, Switzerland is out-of-print and online sellers are charging a fortune for it.  You can play it and the USA and Europe versions online, however, for a much more reasonable cost (live opponents or vs. the computer).  I've played the online version almost 1,000 times since August 2010 but I still love playing the board games.  They are my favorite board games of all time!

One thing to watch out for, in my opinion, is that the original USA edition is initially fun but that fun can turn to frustration once you realize the easiest way to win is to just build the long northern routes. That problem is corrected with the 1910 Expansion by providing new route tickets, a new way to score bonus points, and two variants: Big Cities and USA Mega-Game -- the Mega-Game uses everything in the expansion set and is my favorite way to play Ticket To Ride: USA). However, I still prefer the maps and additional challenges (like building ferries and tunnels) that are provided by the Europe and Marklin editions.

No matter which version you pick, if you know how to play one, the others are easy to pick up, and the rules of all editions are fast and easy to learn in about 5 minutes.

Ticket To Ride is, in my opinion, the best light strategy (or ""gateway"") game on the market to bring family and friends together.  Actual game time may vary depending on the number of players, their familiarity with the maps and rules, and how quickly they can strategize and complete their turn (most turns are finished in a minute or less but some could last up to 5, especially when choosing additional route tickets). I'd say every version of Ticket To Ride (even with expansions) takes about 60 minutes on average but a game could last anywhere from 30-120 minutes (the difference between having 2 players vs. 4-5, for example, and/or if some newbie players need rules or strategy help, or are just really bad at making decisions and revising their strategy on the fly).",4.0
This is a great game.  The one I ordered on Amazon was sent to my dad for Father's Day.  He loves it too.  The entire family is all hooked.,4.0
"Ticket to ride is a great game with excellent game mechanics.  In each turn you can do one of three things: get train cards, get destination tickets, or claim a route.  As a result, the turns are rapid-paced which helps to keep players engaged.  Sometimes I will finish my turn and go to get a glass of water only to find that the other players have taking their turns and are waiting on me.

The game has a couple of shortcomings that keep it from being rated as 5-stars.  The playing cards are smaller than standard playing cards, which is a bit of a pain considering the amount of shuffling you need to do in the game.  There is also a small number of destination tickets.  However, both of these shortcomings can be overcome with the USA 1910 expansion pack&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-1910-Expansion/dp/B000K8FYAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1910 Expansion</a>&nbsp;which has standard sized cards and more than 2x the destination tickets.  I view this expansion as necessary for the game.

This is a very fun game.  However, if you are on the fence between Ticket to Ride and Ticket to Ride: Europe&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ticket-to-Ride-Europe/dp/B000809OAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ticket to Ride Europe</a>, I would go with the Europe version.  It adds a couple new rules/features that really enhance the gameplay, namely ferries (where a locomotive/wild card is needed to complete a route, tunnels (where there is the element of chance that you may need up to 3 extra cards to complete the route -- after all tunnels do sometimes have construction delays), and train stations (where you can lose points to build them, but you can count and opponent's route to help you finish a destination ticket).  Like I said Ticket to Ride is an excellent game, but Ticket to Ride Europe just steps it up an extra notch without going overboard.",4.0
"The game is fun and it doesn't last for hours.  The only downfall about this game is that only 5 people can play it.  It would be much better if at least 6 could play.  We bought the expansion set but haven't used it yet.  Even then,  it doesn't expand the number of players, just the destinations.",4.0
"This is a fun family game.  The object is to try and complete as many destinations as you can by placing colored train cars on the tracks.  Kids can practice planning, strategy, and math skills while having fun too.  Slightly more competitive with 2 or 3 players as only 1 set of tracks is used (instead of double tracks in certain areas), but fun just the same.",4.0
I played Ticket to Ride with four of our grandchildren - aged 7 to 14. We played steadily for half the day and had fun. The eager-beaver middle child learned about hanging on to cards and building up long suits in order to score more points - as opposed to immediate gratification by gaining small distances and getting fewer points. That seemed like a good lesson.,4.0
This is a great early teen and adult game.  We have had fun playing this since Christmas. The only thing that I found was the board came apart after only playing it a few times.  We just taped it on the back side and went on to play.  It only takes about an hour and there's an end to the game.  Very fun!,4.0
"We had played this with some friends who were moving away, so I got it for my husband for Christmas. He and my siblings and brother in law played it 3 times Christmas Day.  It was the first time my brother and sister played it, and they said they were addicted.  My sister even called later to find out where I'd found it.
My complaint is that the cards are very small, but you make due.  It really is a fun game.  It takes about an hour to play the first time when you have 4 or 5 people, but you can get the game down to 40 minutes, maybe less, when you all know what's going on.  It goes pretty quickly if everyone understands it.",4.0
"Great game, really fun to play, very easy to explain/understand the rules = lotsa fun",4.0
"This is a very good game for up to five people.  It is a strategic game on three levels, with a scoring system that keeps you guessing as to who the real winner is until the gmae is over.  Our adult son introduced it to us and we've played it with company since then.  It provides a nice evening's entertainment.",4.0
"Game arrived on the day promised and we immediately took it with us on vacation (just the contents, not the box).  We played it for the first time with our kids (20-26 yrs) and their friends and everyone really enjoyed it.  They even asked to play it in the evening when they were too tired to go ""out on the town"".  That impressed me.  We're slowly learning the strategic elements of the game, and I am definitely sharpening my US geography (this is a huge plus for me).",4.0
"The first in the Alan Moon Ticket To Ride series is a great game. TtR America is really a game where you are searching for the best path and trying to take it before your competitors do. In addition it requires you to find a path and on some level manage your resources (cards). When we first got this game my friends and I played it incessantly.

The one problem with this game is that a very strong strategy for winning also makes it a lot less fun to play. One of my friends who plays it always goes for the finish all the 6 length train strategy which considerably shortens the game and often does not give the other players enough time to complete their destinations before the game ends. We have found that if multiple people try and get the 6 length trains it balances the game out again.",4.0
"I had read several reviews on this game and had very high hopes for it. Everyone said it was an amazing game and if you were to ask my boyfriend, he would highly agree with it being amazing. I think the key to this game is having more than two people, which is what has made it less fun for me to play.  We kind of developed our own rules for making it a two player game (we only take 10 destination cards instead of the whole pile).  Otherwise our scores were in the negative.

We have played it probably a dozen times and it makes more and more sense the more you play it. It is kind of in the genre of the game ""Risk"" but with Trains.  Now, mind you, my opinion is not my boyfriends opinion.  He has been noted to be up until 1am playing ""the Train Game"" by HIMSELF.  He is 40 years old and He LOVES this game and will play it incessantly.  So, he would say it is the best game he has ever played (and his game collection is close to 20+ board games) and mine could be slightly tilted because every time we hang out, Ticket to Ride is part of the plan :) It is the birthday gift that keeps on giving.

***I am revising my previous statement. We didn't understand all of the rules properly and we were playing the game incorrectly.  Now that we figured it out, I would highly recommend it.  Much better when you understand the directions!",4.0
"We did enjoy this game, but misses having the bridges available that are in the European version when a path is not available to use.  It is a great family game.",4.0
"I chose this boardgame for my niece after carefully reading many reviews.  I was able to play the game with her and was a little bit disappointed.  I was expecting a game with more strategy.  My favorite game for all ages is Blokus, since even little people can give it a try without being able to read, and Blokus is all strategy and no luck.",4.0
"I can't really top any of the other excellent reviews for this game.  However, I'd like to toss my hat into the ring and recommend the Ticket to Ride series to anyone looking for a well designed family game to beat the usual crowd (Monopoly, etc).  It's fun, replayable, rewards experienced players, but has some luck to make it interesting.  TTR even masks some fine educational merits in a pretty package... geography, math, tactical and strategic thinking.",4.0
"I like playing board games with family and friends and do have a small collection.  I did some reviews on Ticket to Ride which came highly recommended.  I have only played the game twice since I bought it last month and was pleased.  The first time my wife, 5 year old, 8 year old, and I played.  The rules were simple enought to follow and I helped my 5 year old along.  The 8 year caught on pretty quick, but needed some guidence along the way. We kept it simple and I believe the kids did enjoy it, but they haven't asked to play again since. The second time I played it was over Thanksgiving with the adults in the family.  They caught on quickly and it became a very competitive game. Over all it was fun, but the next day, they went back to playing Mega-Monopoly.

If you are looking for a game with simple rules and want some competitiveness (if thats a word), then I would recommend it for you, or if you want to teach you kids about the USA and the location of major citys then I would recommend it.  If you want something more detailed and thought processing then you might want to look at some other game.",4.0
I am very happy with Ticket to Ride. I play it with my friends (I'm 31) and with my children (the youngest is 5). My kids love it! We play differently than in the official rules and Daddy helps them decide what to do (and I don't always win). A lot of fun for everyone!,4.0
This game has simple rules but that doesn't mean there's not strategy. I like this game a lot. I only take off 1 star because you need a very large physical playing space and the pieces are awkward to place on the board. A+ for rules and concept. B- for execution.,4.0
"I'm not much of a boardgame guy, but after playing the demo for TICKET TO RIDE on Xbox Live, I decided to pick up a copy of the actual board game.  I'm glad I did.

So far, I've introduced this to two totally different groups of people (my family and colleagues at work) and both of them enjoyed themselves immensely. It's very easy to grasp the rules, and while there is some competition between players, it's definitely not a cut-throat experience.

Much, much more entertaining than traditional American games like Monopoly (at least for me).",4.0
I really enjoy playing this game with family and friends.  It is even fun to play with older children.  I was first introduced to this game with the europe version - I really liked that version better than the USA one because of the tunnels you can do.  But this is a great starter one to get you going and aquainted to the game.  I will definately be buying more versions of this game!  Only gripe is - cards are small.,4.0
"The game design is excellent; learning to play requires under five minutes! There is plenty of subtle strategy for advanced board gamers. You can play it with children of 8 years or more I believe and they would enjoy the game as well. Porbably one of the top  board games in the last 20 years.

Having said this, there is one key defect: the cards are too small and are also wearing out quickly. I refuse to buy another entire game just to acquire a new set of cards. The game mfr. has to resolve this issue pretty soon or the good will of the customer base will be lost.",4.0
"Played this game first with our daughter and son-in-law. Good way to spend a cold Sunday afternoon. However, they had the Europe version, we ordered the US. The Europe version was a little more challenging, more interesting. (Tunnels and ferries.) If playing with younger children, the U.S. version would be great. We preferred the Europe version.",4.0
"Ticket to Ride has all the hallmarks of a classic family game.  It's easy to learn, easy to play, and doesn't take a really long time.  But it also offers a myriad of strategy possibilities, so it has great ""replayability.""  I think this would be good for most kids as well, teaching them some math and geography skills.  (Just keep in mind the train pieces are small and not appropriate for very young children.)

One other thing I appreciate about the game is that you can play with just 2 people.  But be warned - it plays very differently when you add more players to the mix!

If you want a simple strategy game that's beautifully designed, this is for you.  I liked it so much, I bought it as a gift for my brother.",4.0
"Fun game for the family (10 and up?).  Mostly a good mix of randomness and strategy. At first it seemed too random for my competitive nature, but once we really understood the game, more strategies became apparent. I'd guess ages 10 and up would enjoy, perhaps some younger kids too. I don't think I'd enjoy playing with younger kids though because it's a long game (at least an hour) and I play to win. My son is 13 and can handle that (and beat me).",4.0
"After noting that Ticket to Ride continues to be one of the highest-rated board games at numerous board gamer sites, we bought a copy.

The board gamers are right. This German-made game beats familiar games like Monopoly and Risk hands-down.

OBJECT

Each player must complete a series of rail lines spanning cities based upon destination cards drawn at the beginning (and throughout) the game. Each destination carries points related to the length of the line, so a New York to Los Angeles line would score more points than Chicago to Boston. Incomplete destinations count against players at the end of the game, so completing them, even through circuitous routes is a must. The exciting part of the game comes from not knowing who is completing his or her lines, plus the ability to overlap lines, stymieing other players.

Game play takes between 30 and 90 minutes depending on the number of players and the speed at which they make decisions.

GAME PIECES

High quality throughout, the game includes:

- A fold-out board of the United States and southern Canada, plus a scoring track around the edge. The cities on the board connect through colored track lines, each line between one and six units in length.

- A set of destination cards showing lines that must be completed.

- Five sets of forty-five train pieces. Each player takes one same-color set of trains.

- A set of colored train cards that correspond to the colored lines that connect cities.

- Scoring markers that correspond to a player's train color.

PLAY

Each player is dealt three destination cards in the beginning and must keep at least two. These form the basis for their lines. They also receive four train cards. To claim a line, players must create sets of the same color and number of train cards as the line connecting two cities. (The color of the lines has nothing to do with the player's train color, but the cards they have in hand.)

Each player, in turn, can perform one of three actions:

1. Draw two train cards per turn from either the set of five placed up for all players to see, or blind from the train card deck. (One card if one of the showing wild cards is chosen.)

2. Play a set of matching train card colors to claim a line between two cities.

3. Get dealt a new set of three destination cards, keeping at least one.

Players score points when they claim a line of track connecting two cities, the length of the track yielding proportionately higher scores. Scoring markers are moved around the 100-point scoring guide on the board perimeter.

When one player has laid all his or her train pieces, the other players get one last turn. Players then reveal their destination cards and add (or subtract, for incomplete lines) to their total. The longest continuous length of claimed track scores additional points, too. Highest point total wins.

REVIEW

Pros:

A gorgeous, well-made game that's easy on the eyes, Ticket to Ride combines simple rules and nail-biting game play with a significant level of strategy. You can't ask for more in a board game.

All ages will love this game. Even children as young as six can play since the rules are simple.

Will please folks sick of the usual board games everyone has.

Game play is short enough to allow multiple sessions of play.

The manufacturer has other games in the Ticket to Ride series that work off the same basic gaming system, though with differing degrees of skill (through additional rules and trickier city layouts). Expansion kits exist, too, so players familiar with the game can get an additional kick out of their existing set. Lastly, an online, multi-player, interactive version of the game can be played through the manufacturer's Web site.

Cons:

The manufacturer lists a game session as lasting 30-60 minutes. We've found it closer to 45-90 minutes.

Ticket to Ride has been around since 2004 and is beginning to show some age when compared against newer European-style board games. In addition, other games in the Ticket to Ride series eclipse the base game (though some expansions require the base game for play). For a game that plays similarly to Ticket to Ride but adds more depth of play, consider Ticket to Ride designer Alan Moon's Airlines Europe.

OVERALL

As someone who loves games, I found Ticket to Ride to be a great introduction to European-style board games. Nothing disappoints. Everyone who plays the game wants to know where to get a copy. Ticket to Ride has won numerous Game of the Year honors around the world, and it's easy to see why. Absolutely worthy of its stars.

UPDATE: For enhanced play, consider the 1910 expansion. It includes larger, easier-to-read cards, additional destinations, and more winning conditions. It makes a four-star game into five!",4.0
"We have only played a few times, but have really enjoyed it and like that it can be played with only 2 players.  The instructions seem complex at first, but once you get going it's really fairly simple to play.  However it isn't simple to win -- it takes quite a bit of strategy and isn't just about luck.",4.0
"This game is quick to learn and fun to play. You can play with 2, 3, 4 or 5 people so it's good for varying group sizes. The European version adds a few extra 'twists' but this is the basic version and the game play is very similar to the Europe version. So if you have one of them, that's probably OK - at least for beginners or casual gamers.",4.0
"THis game only got 4 due to the luck factor.  No matter how well you play, you could just draw bad cards everytime.  That is it.  Other than that, this is a wonderful, wonderful game.  This IS the perfect game to get people into Eurogames like Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.  Easy to explain - 5 minutes tops.  Fast to play - 1 hour.  Good strategy.  Good theme.  You even feel like you are being educated at least a little bit in the area of US geography.

Bottom Line:  Best family board game in existance.  Anyone can learn to play it relatively quickly.",4.0

"The Elf does what the elf is supposed to do, but apparently that is nothing.  Turns out, I have to move this lazy dude EVERY night!  Plus, he's creepy.  I feel like he's watching me, always.  Even as I write this... there he is, watching me.  But, the kids are happy about him, so I'll just deal with the creepiness of this little guy for the next...oh God...18 years..",4.0

"This is a cute production and a nice holiday tradition. I read it to my son and he picked a name. I voted for Skippy or Jingle bells. He picked Fred. His mom thought of all sorts of hilarious props and scenarios for Fred. We are going to keep doing it long after he figures out the whole Santa thing because it is lots of fun to come up with different ideas. It was so popular this holiday season that stores were sold out in our area. While I think it is a tad overpriced for a doll with felt points for legs, it was cheaper on Amazon then it was in the stores. The shipping was fast and it was well packaged. This is a holiday keeper.",4.0
I only bought this because our kids came home from school begging. It is too expensive for what it is worth. Don't feed into the pressure!!!,4.0
Arrived right on time. My grandson was thrilled!,4.0
what I expected,4.0
"Kids love it, the book was a hit",4.0
This was a good deal. I bought it as a gift for my husband we had allot of fun with it this Holiday season.,4.0
The quality of the book and elf is fantastic. The only problem is remembering to move the stupid elf every night. That was a daily struggle for our family.,4.0
"This saved Christmas as we were ""deep in the terrible two's"" as December approached.  The Elf really helped any time that our little guys started acting up :).",4.0

This made the month of December a little more exiting every morning.!!  I didn't really Enjoy waking up at 3AM  thinking ohh snap i forgot to move the Elf but thats our fault.. we enjoyed it,4.0
Cute story. Kids were excited about looking for the elf each morning. Would be better if the arms and legs were poseable.,4.0
I little pricey but what can ya do. I wish it had some flexible little poles within the elf to make it easier to put in positions. Regardless my kids loved the idea of the elf (Peter Brown Pan).,4.0
Way to expensive for a book and a doll,4.0
kinda neat idea,4.0
"My kids absolutely love this! It is truly a fun thing to do with the family during the Christmas month. I will admit that I think you could actually do this with any elf you purchase, as there are enough ideas online to get started! The doll itself is nicely constructed, but nothing fancy. It seems like it will last for the duration of my children's (5 and 3) belief in ""Santa."" Because they cannot touch it, I suspect it will last much much longer! We love it! One thing...I do wish skin tone options were more easily available and did not cost more money!",4.0
"This was a big hit this year with our daughter. She is 8 and we were not sure she would enjoy it. We were very wrong. We brought this out after Thanksgiving, read the book and have been enjoying the ""crazy and weird"" things this elf does every night. On a few occasions, our daughter swore he moved when we were not home and even left it a picture and notes. It is nice to see her wake up happy and ready to find the little rascal.

The elf itself consists of a typical stuffing material and is pretty bendable and strong. We have had him bend-hung-flattened and he is like new with no signs of any issues. The box it comes with is very solid and makes for a great sturdy storage for in between seasons.

Great idea that once you buy it, will provide years of enjoyment. Highly recommend. Might even be adding the girl version in the future.

I took one star away as the hands lacked an important feature. They come stitched together which limit the function for positions, etc a great deal. They should put strong magnets in the hands so that you can separate them and use them for metal object ideas, etc.",4.0
"Bought as a gift, the children love him and I love getting to see pictures of his mischievous shenanigans!",4.0
A lot of money for a felt elf and a book but the kids love it. If you've never done elf on the shelf I'd recommend reading the book and preparing your story for the elfs entrance before introducing it to your kids. I almost screwed it up. My 3 year old doesn't quite get it yet but my 9 year old loves looking for him every morning.,4.0
Wish the arms and legs were more sturdy.,4.0
"the book is nice and the whole concept is pretty good. however, i don't like the fact that my child wants to act so much better when there's supposedly a magic elf.. darn kid should be good all the time! ha. anyway, it's fun and easy to think of even VERY simple ideas for the elf to go. however i wish the hands had velcro or something because having his hands sewn together makes things tricky.",4.0
"Fun for the kids, just not a fan of the book. It creeped out my 5 yr old.",4.0
Wish his hands would separate and be bendable with wire inside.,4.0
"Box was broken a little, but the Elf and Book were fine.",4.0
Great condition! Although not sure if the original book had a girl elf but ours did. Also when I ordered it I didn't realize it was used. Until we started reading it and found out it belonged to someone else and the had their info in it. Otherwise it serves it's purpose.,4.0
good delivery and a great set,4.0
"We had so much fun with our elf, but I wish the arms and legs were positionable. The hands are sewn together which makes some staging difficult. Magnetic hands would have been awesome.",4.0
"I teach 4th Grade, and my students loved our elf! Some of my students who normally misbehaved on a regular basis really tried to be good for Figgy Jinx (our elf). The elf and book are good quality. I wish there was a version of the book that could be used in the classroom. I changed the words as I read to fit a school setting, but I would probably be willing to buy a school version of the book.",4.0
"While I do not subscribe to the message it sends, I do like the interaction it inspires.  We created our own message to our son of what our Elf means to our family and that seems to work for us.",4.0
"Our grandchildren have used Elf on the Shelf and Magic Elf for the past ten years. The magic is gone but the remain a part of our Holiday Tradition but rather than make the elf a House Spy we've turned the elves into teachers and supporters of our family values.  You can see some of our ideas at www. BestElfIdeas.com.  Back in 1992 when my children were teenagers I saw that the excitement had disappeared from Christmas Morning and it had turned into a 15 minute Unwrapping Event, so I created The Christmas Web (www. ChristmasWeb.com) and it has survived now for 23 years.",4.0
"It is an Elf on the Shelf...so you typically know what you're getting. I only wish the arms/legs were positionable...they mostly just flop around and if your kids catch you using a clothespin, tape or safetypin to hold it in a cool position then it could really hurt the ""magic.""",4.0
Better than I expected,4.0
Creepy elf. My kids love him because they have no idea what he does at night.,4.0
"My family had so much fun with this over the holiday season. It's a great tradition to start for any family. I would have given it 5 stars if it would have been more user friendly. For example, the arms and legs should be able to be posed or bendable so you can attach him to things. Or even if there was velcro on the hands instead of them being seen. Otherwise great purchase!",4.0
"It's a fad item, but an easy and fun trap to fall into around the holidays. I don't have small children, it was purely for my own fun and amusement and those of my Facebook friends. My mother ordered one too so next year should be fun. It's a bit pricey for what it is, but still, it's cute.",4.0
I get they not to touch the elf but when you get yours you will understand why. There clothed in crafting felt. Cheaply made but works great in my buisness to encourage good behavior in a day when parents no longer consider that there responsibility. Every buisness needs a elf on the shelf,4.0
Ordered a girl not boy,4.0
Great read.  My boys enjoyed it.,4.0
It's poorly made but added wire to ours. The concept is fun and brings the Christmas spirit. With some edits to the elf its can be more fun. Four stars simply for Christmas spirit.,4.0

My daughter loves her Elf on the Shelf and she had a ball thinking of mischievous things for him to do,4.0
"This is a cute tradition.  The book isn't a remarkable piece of children's literature, however.  And the elf would be better if his hands were velcro'd instead of sewed.  It would also be nice if his legs had some kind of wire in them so they could be positioned.  There are DIY ways on how to do this on Pinterest, but honestly, who has the time?  The price is high enough for this book and elf that they could make the elf a little easier to position.",4.0
"these guys are cute, and the possibilities for holiday entertainment are pretty much endless.  Just be prepared for it.  Strongly urge parents to plan a schedule so you avoid the last minute ""oh crud, we forgot to move the elf"" panic.  Also may be better for 5-7yo??  Our 4yo struggled with the ""no touch"" rule, and just didn't seem phased by the ""elf tells Santa"" concept.",4.0
Just as described,4.0
This is the first year we did this and my kids love their elf. The only thing that would make this better is having ideas with it. You have to find ideas on Pinterest or the web. To have it all in one place would be better.,4.0

"My girls are still a bit young to understand the concept, but my oldest is slowly learning to look for ""Buddy"" in a new spot every day.  It's so much fun to see her little face light up when she spots him!",4.0
"For any parent looking to put themselves through 25 days of torture, meaning you wake up in the middle of the night because you forgot to preform an elaborate scene involving a stiff, footless elf, this is for you.

In all honesty, I like the elf. Waffles (we named him as the book said to do) is a great size to hide around the house, and comes with a book and box. The book is ok, we only read it once a year when he arrives (from storage....um the North Pole) however it does not give a ton of background information on him. The website you link with is great!

I do have once concern, he has no feet, I am guessing because it would cost more to put create them.",4.0
I wish he came already bendable his clothes not as cheap. Don't know that it was worth over 30$.,4.0
The kids love it.,4.0
Love it,4.0
"Very nice book that came with the Elf. Unfortunately, my granddaughter is scared of this creepy Elf. She said he could stay ONLY if he stayed in the box.",4.0
Having such a great time with the elf.  He's a little odd looking and other than that he's perfect. Look forward to nightly stagings. And our 4 year old thinks he's real.  Well worth the money.,4.0
Cute.  I put the elf at my son's house and will give them the book for Christmas.,4.0
creepy little guy with creepy eyes and concept. but my 2 & 3 year old love him. not too hard to move him around the house before I go to bed. seeing the kids excitement is well worth sharing my home with such a creepy elf. I'm thinking of inserting wire in its limbs to make bendable.,4.0
I have an 8 year son who wakes up everyday to find where his elf on the self has hidden...the best part if my day...love it...,4.0
"Bought this as a gift for my grandson.  He was thrilled to receive him, named him Harry, and has been enjoying finding where Harry is each morning when he wakes up...and Harry has been an incentive for an increase in good behavior so far.",4.0
"As a mom, I often find myself with not much to do. Once the kids go to bed for the night, I'll sit there wracking my brain for new ways to entertain them. Elf on a Shelf inspires me to be more creative late at night, during the holidays, when I used to waste time wrapping gifts, watching TV, or enjoying a Hot Toddy with another adult. Did the kids even know I loved them before we had the Elf?!  It's a scary thought, but maybe they didn't. Christmas without the Elf is just a few weeks filled with anticipation, candy, shopping, a long school vacation, hot chocolate, cookie decorating, tons of exciting gifts, staying up late watching Christmas movies, sledding, ice skating, gingerbread house building, puzzle building with cousins in front of roaring fires...Like many moms it has me asking, ""But what am *I* supposed to be doing?"" That's why night-time is Elf Time. During the day, I keep an eye on Pinterest for new ideas. I got a lot of study time in during The Nutcracker with my kids the other night. Currently, I'm at the preschool potluck, and planning some super epic mischief for our Elf to get into!! Sometimes we moms simply need to put in a little elbow grease to create those unique holiday traditions that bind families together. That's what Elfing does for us. I might be tired and stressed out from wrecking my kitchen or the family car to make a single cute Facebook post, but it all will be worth it when I see the kids' surprised amusement for those five, glorious minutes.",4.0
"My son loves this whole thing....I have been going nuts every night making his elf that he named ""Spikey Hattie"" do strange things all over the house. There are two things that I would complain about though....first, that the elf doesn't have bendable arms and legs. You would think that this company would know what people will be doing with it and would make the elf capable of holding onto things and staying in certain positions, instead of just being all floppy and really difficult to make it stay in whatever position you are trying to get it to stay in. I ended up having to do middle of the night emergency elf surgery, and opened up the ends of his arms and legs to put wire inside and them sew it back up, so that I could get him to the point where he was able to do more than just sit awkwardly. Also, the price is pretty outrageous, especially for a floppy and not so well made toy elf. I mean, cmon....thirty bucks is ridiculous for something like this....It's taking advantage of the fact that parents want to make their kids christmas special by doing things like this. If I knew how to sew better than I do, I would just make my own, and just buy the book or something.",4.0
"Fast shipping! Box came like new, elf was lose and wasn't the light elf was kind of darker in the middle. But over all kids are very happy! Thanks",4.0

"A little on the creepy side, having a little elf around the house during Christmas time, but the kids love it. Locating the Elf around the house is what this elf is used for. Pretty cool to get the children in the Christmas spirit.",4.0

"I read the book with my 2 and 4yo boys, but it was a little creepy.  We basically ditched most of the ""the elf is WATCHING you"" stuff and just put the elf in funny places for the boys to find every morning.  They named him Mr. Shinkansen (no kidding) and they had a blast discovering what he'd been up to every morning.  He made snowflakes and scattered them around the room, made paper airplanes, strung cheerios into a necklace, jumbled up the numbers and seasons on their calendar, took all the candy canes off the tree, stacked blocks into a tall tower.... One night, he brought the boys hats and mittens from the North pole!

Skip the book, just do the fun stuff.",4.0
"OK price, delivered Fast and without damage. Given at Christmas as a gift.  Was perfect for the receiver and really made the little one smile.",4.0
"We joined the crowds and bought one this year, he was a lot of fun to move around the house and do funny tricks. I wish his limbs were more pose able and stayed put more easily. But the storage box was very sturdy and I like that.",4.0
I got this for my grandkids age 2 - 21. I think there dad had as much fun finding new places as the kids dis finding it . Even the 21 year old couldn't wait to see where it was.,4.0
"My grandchildren loved ELF but when he ""appeared"" near a chandelier he was discovered to have burn marks....so beware ELF is not burn proof, not sure if his fire proof...but he brought great fun and smiles to five little faces for weeks!!!",4.0
"The first night there was some crying.  ""Hey, this elf is going to spy on you and sneak around the house to see what you're doing!""  The kids did NOT care for some creepy elf sneaking around.  After the first night they got used to it and it was fun after that.",4.0
My grandchildren absolutely love it and the cost for me was well worth seeing their excitement throughout the holidays.  Can't wait for Christmas 2014.,4.0
"I've got three kids in the house (Ages 2, 3 and 4) and this was the first year we did the whole Elf On a Shelf thing.  The kids thought it was great and they loved me reading this book to them every night on the weeks before Christmas.  I even loved creeping out my boyfriend with the Elf by setting him up in odd places where he didn't expect those big blue eyes to be starring at him.  Good times, great tradition.",4.0
After I ordered this it arrived very quickly which is always nice. My boyfriend's children have enjoyed this Elf on the Shelf very much through out the Christmas season and were sad to see him leave once Christmas was over.,4.0
"It's pretty nice, the only thing I didn't like is that the hands are stick together, you cannot put the elf in many positions or places.",4.0
"If you have children or a festive family you need an elf.
The only thing I wish they would have done with the elf is make it more movable.
I thought the elf would have bendable parts but he didn't.
Other than that we love our new family member and such a magical tradition.
I didn't want to be a follower when it came to this because it seems everyone is doing it but it's worth the twinkle in your childrens eyes.",4.0
"My grandchildren like it very much and their parents are also having fun creating antics for elf!!!  My youngest grandson doesn't understand the concept yet, but, will next year!",4.0

Tons of fun at our house around the holidays.  Elf's clothes feel cheaply made however.  Simple felt. He seems to stay in place well however.,4.0
I was excited to introduce elf this year with my little one and have it be a yearly tradition.  I hope it becomes something that she remembers and looks forward to every year.,4.0
"been looking for this troublesome elf on the shelf for years and finally seen it on amazon ....and because of it's popularity it was sold at walmart, target, and the hallmark stores this year and  for the same price as amazon...target had it cheaper for 29.98 and I paid 32.00 at amazon.  but that's ok I finally got it and happy with it...I think i'm going to give the book away or just keep it for Christmas decoration .. shipped in good shape",4.0
"Everything was perfect; the elf, delivery but to bring it here to Norway was too expensive. I payed  51 + almost 50 in quick delivery and postage and taxes. Way to expensive but  we have had a lot of fun with the elf every day in desember.",4.0
"This is a fun and great present for any little kids you might have in your family, Im glad we bought this",4.0
Great concept for those who have children 3-7 years old that still believe.  Even gives parents excitement of being able to find unique locations on a nightly basis.  Great invention!!,4.0
My son loves the Elf on the Shelf. Its year two with our elf and each day my son is giddy to find our elf. Sent this as a gift this year to my nephews with hopes they enjoy it as much ss my son does.,4.0
"It did not thoroughly explain that only the book was included.  However, the book was in great shape.  Thank u.",4.0
"The cost of this seems a little ridiculous, but hey the boys love Pete and actively look for him each morning. so yes it is entertaining.",4.0
"This just seems like one of those instant classic toys. We starting using the Elf on the Shelf last year after our kids were asking about why we did not get an elf and so-and-so does. Within days it felt like we had been using the elf toy for years. Our children enjoy the hunt each morning, especially if Elf has been mischievous during the night. This always brings out big laughs. It does not take much effort to find a place for Elf to be each morning. No worries if Elf decides to stay put two days in a row...it must be a comfortable spot. Notably, Elf's legs have creases to bend, but the arms do not. That said, you can fold the arms, they just do not have creases built in.",4.0
I love it the kids love it we were all very excited to get out Elf. I give it only 4 bc I guess I assumed it came with the DVD. Aside from that it is great,4.0
"Very cute tradition to start with the kids.  Naughty little Elf took his hat off during transport and I had to hot glue it back on his head.  Other than that, great purchase!",4.0
I love the concept of the elf on the shelf but the book is a harsh and doesn't capture the spirit of the holiday.  The story seems like it is intended for parents to use this as a tool to punish and control kids by scaring them with the idea that the elf will tattle on them to Santa.  Wish I would have saved the $ on buying the book/doll combo and just bought the elf.,4.0
"The minute the children saw this little fella, it was non-stop questioning. Many of the other reviewers warned that would happen. Not having all the answers is the only bummer to this product. What a great tradition. it gets the whole family interacting. The story is adorable.
The only complaint I've heard was from adults being freaked out by the fella himself... his eyes follow you everywhere  ;)",4.0
"This is a fun tradition that I'm starting this year with my kids. Overall, the kids love it. I feel like it was very expensive for what came with it, but I guess it's more of an investment in the future holidays. Also, he's a little creepy looking, but we already knew that.",4.0
"This is a hardbound story book that explains how Santa relies on The Elf on the Shelf as a type of scout. Once your Elf on the Shelf is adopted and named, it is granted its magical powers and truly becomes part of your family as it travels back and forth to the North Pole, telling Santa about the day's activities. When The Elf on the Shelf returns from the North Pole each morning, it finds a new place to sit and spend the day. Kids will love waking up each morning during the holiday season to see where The Elf on the Shelf is!

There are only two rules: The Elf on the Shelf must never be touched; and The Elf on the Shelf will not move or speak when anyone is watching it--its job is to watch and listen. This wonderful story and magical scout elf will quickly become a beloved Christmas tradition, one your family will look forward to each and every year.

Reinforcing this tradition is a coloring book from The Elf on the Shelf's animated special, An Elf's Story. It's filled with fun activities and even some Elf on the Shelf stickers that children will love.

Elf on the Shelf is a craze, but it is fun for the entire family. From 2 to 102, everyone enjoys this fun.

The elf isn't as cute as the slightly larger stuffed version but I like that this is a complete box set with the elf and the book--we actually replaced the elf with the Pop! Version of elf on a shelf,4.0
All children seem to absolutely love the Elf on the Shelf. I have my first baby on the way and after seeing my two nephews get so into this I can't wait to get one for my own baby! Such a great idea!,4.0
"Like many reviewers, we were worried about the inherent creepiness of an elf who watched our children all the time and reported back to Santa- they're a little young for 1984. At the urging of friends who had modified the elf message, though, we got one.

After reading the book privately we decided not to share the story with our kids. At our house, a greeting letter from the elf arrives on Thanksgiving evening, and in the morning, the elf himself has arrived at the house.

Our elf (we just call him The Elf) is simply a Christmas visitor from Santa, not his policelf. Every night when we go to sleep the elf has the run of the house, and when we wake up he's managed to get himself into a variety of good or tricky situations.

Instead of judging our kids' actions, we talk with our kids about whether the elf has made good or bad decisions the night before. Some mornings, we find the elf in the kitchen where he's made the family blueberry muffins- nice elf! Some mornings, he's caught having a cereal bowl bath in marshmallows- naughty elf! Daddy has proven to have a hidden genius for Naughty Elf nights, including plopping little chocolate kisses in the toilet (nice elves always remember to flush).

This can be a hilarious tradition if you're not afraid to ditch the book completely and make the elf your own.",4.0
This is a fun and useful tradition to start with your child. Just don't start it too early (November would be good) as you don't want to be moving the elf around every day all year ;0D,4.0
"His hat doesn't stay on, but he's cute. It will be a nice Christmas tradition to start with my family.",4.0
"I really like the story and the concept of the elf watching over them to see that they are good girls and boys. My kids also like waking up to try and find where the elf is hiding. However, at age 1 and 3 they screamed to hold the elf and I let them. So, they take turns holding the elf while I read the story. I see no point to adhere to that part of the story where the elf loses his magic if he is touched. My kids love taking turns playing with him like he is their little friend. However, they know that he will hide at night and that they must find him.

With that minor tweak to the story it has become a wonderful Christmas tradition that i hope to continue. It is fun for me and my husband to brainstorm ideas of where the elf could hide each night. If you need ideas, check out Pinterest. There are loads of endearing and funny examples of places to place the elf. One that I haven't tried but that did make me laugh is where the elf is hanging from the toilet bowel and inside the toilet bowl is a floating candy cane colored small round candy (meant to be a festive elf poop). If you have a sense of humor about it, you can really be creative about where to place the elf.

The elf and the book have held up well over the past two Christmases. And my children really do behave better when I remind them that the elf is watching. I also think the elf is cute and do not get a scary vibe at all. In sum, I would recommend this book as a fun Christmas tradition.",4.0
the original listing should be more clear as to the gender.  I was able to switch it out so overall I am very happy with the purchase.  the doll was good quality and the shipping was very fast.  thank you,4.0
"The Elf on the Shelf comes with a story and elf character which your child names.  Each night the elf ""flies away to the North Pole"" to report to Santa on the child's behavior for that day.  My son was only 2 when we used it this year, so I'm not sure he totally understood the concept but he did enjoy spotting the elf each morning.  It seems to me this will be one of those Christmas traditions where, if you don't do it in your house, you will be one of the few families that does not.",4.0
"My three year old daughter wasn't into it as much as I would have liked, but it is fun to hide the elf and then make him pop up somewhere else in the house. A little pricey, but fun. Overall, I'm glad I bought it.",4.0
"Its exactly what I expected, so I guess that makes it good lol. Its really up to you how fun this toy is...ours makes snow angels in sugar, hooks up with Barbies, the other toys kidnap him & tie him up hostage and for our 20 yr old son he like to hold scissors in one hand and fake hair in the other lol he may be in the flour bag after hes just been ""antiqued"", steals cell phones & such lol...its all up to u",4.0

"My 11 yo nephew was wide-eyed as he dramatically told me how it was ""proven"" that the elf moved, etc.  After that, I couldn't not buy it for him for Christmas.  He was so excited when he opened it!  I read through the book (which I thought was pretty goofy, but if the kids like it, then who am I to judge?) and it at least explained the whole concept.  I know many people think that this elf idea is creepy, but I have seen so many who have had fun with it, too.  It seemed to be well made, and the boxed-set made it a wonderful presentation for gift-giving.",4.0
"my 2 year old really loved her elf, Bubba. Anytime she thought of something she wanted, she ran over to tell him. Sometimes he would even bring her a little present. Im sure this will be fun years from now when he should become more mischevious, but he's a good elf for now.

i wish his arms and legs had wire in them as it would be easier to position him. he does not stand up on his own.",4.0
"I thought this was a little expensive for what you get, but my son loved finding the elf all over the house so much that I feel it was worth the expense.",4.0
"Y son wanted nothing to so with the elf at first, till he started doing bad things! We had fun with it but I wish he had Velcro on his hands or something because it just seems so cheap. You have to be inventive in how to make him look like he's holding onto things. In the end my son was sad to see the elf go, ours toilet papered the Christmas tree, poured sugar all over the counter and made sugar angels, and put Christmas tattoos on my sons arm in green marker! Can't wait to see what he's gonna do next year!",4.0
My kids loved it!! The book that came with it was also very good in explaining the story of the elf and the ruled to the kids.,4.0
I thought it was a nice tradition to start. I found the story delightful. And look forward to putting my elf back out in 2013 Christma.,4.0
"Kids enjoyed trying to find the elf each morning, story was short and a had a few religious elements that may put some off if they aren't expecting it.

Also wish the actual elf was bendable, would allow for more options for him to hide I suspect :)",4.0
I bought this for my 3 week old grandson hoping to start a tradition that will carry on throughout his childhood. Great fun was had by rge adults in his life.,4.0
"Got this for my 4-yr old son.  The book was good and the elf cute, and he enjoyed looking for it each morning (when he remembered).  I expect that as he gets older it will be more fun to look for the elf and see what he has been up to during the night.  My only issue with the elf is that I feel it would be more easily posed if the arms and legs were adjustable (although there are tutorials online as to how to DIY this).",4.0
"So I bought this at the request of my 9 year old daughter who had seen and read the book at a friends house. My daughter loves the book and the concept but was a little freaked out by the elfs eyes. Additionally, if you commit to buying this little guy, you have to remember to move him every night or else you have some explaining to do the next morning. Seems a little pricey but if your child still believes in santa then this is another holiday tradition.",4.0
"My son had a blast with his elf. We moved it every night and he looked forward to finding his ""Eddie"" every morning. I think it could have been better if the elf had wire or something to make him a little bend-able.. Could of had a lot more places ""Eddie"" could have been hiding. Pretty expensive in my opinion for just a stuffed elf.",4.0

"This product is only a vessel for your own creativity and ambitions as a parent. It is a cute story in a nicely made book with a $2 elf doll. I would have hoped that the elf would have been a higher quality, but as it is, it does hold up and looks pretty good. It can be a chore coming up with new places to put him night after night, but the kids are excited every morning to find him and have enjoyed the experience all around. It was a good buy.",4.0

One found him in the bathroom where the elf had written on the mirror ""I'm watching you"", which made our grandson to blurt out ""OHHH You are in trouble"" and run to find his mom...needless to say that was a good laugh for all the adults.",4.0

"Bought this after seeing so many others out there and thought it looked like a lot of fun and a great way to start a family tradition! Having the elf around worked great most of the time. The hardest part was coming up with quirky scenarios to leave him in. Prepare for lots of questions about him from the kids! But we loved him, and our daughter was sad to see him go after the holidays.",4.0
"My 4 y.o. daughter enjoyed this tradition very much. The book is quick, cute and catchy, and our elf (affectionately named Eugene) will be a favorite for Christmases to come. I'm giving this 4 stars because I do wish he was a bit more pose-able, and I think $30 for a book and elf were a little steep.",4.0
We started a new tradition. The kids loved the book and we were able to name him by pulling each childs name for him out of a hat. The first thing every morning they race to find him.,4.0

I think this is a lovely idea for a new family tradition, one that I hope my children will carry on when they have babies of their own. I think the book and the elf are absolutely adorable, I just wish that the elf was a little more pose-able! Maybe some wire in the arms and legs would make it a bit easier to set up different scenarios. Just an idea, but I still love the elf!",4.0
This is AWESOME!  Love having an elf around!!!  It shipped quickly and I wish I had it years ago!  Lots of fun,4.0
"This is a cute tradition, but it's a lot of work to commit to. I kept forgetting to move the elf every day. I didn't see any real change in behavior. They knew they were getting presents from Santa anyway.",4.0
"I didn't realize how much of a traditionalist that I have become or always was, but I'm not a big fan of adding to the Christmas mythology.  Not that I am a 7th Day Adventist, but I tend philosophically to agree about and understand some of their beliefs.  I am a mainline Presbyterian, but I think that these things just take things further away from the real meaning of Christmas, being the birth of our Lord and Savior.  Is it harmless?  Probably.  Do my kids enjoy it every morning?  Yes.  But I don't necessarily enjoy it, as it further secularizes a religious event.  Obviously, if Christmas is about ""christmas spirit"" then I would encourage the purchase..but if Christmas means more to your family than that, then I would advise you all to be mindful that it is just another thing to push your children further away from the experience of advent.  Again, not harmful...just means that you have to continue to be pro-active about leading and teaching your children.",4.0
This is a cute little felt scout elf who is found on various shelves in your home each morning.  He supposedly reports to Santa about the children's behavior. Nice hardcover story book & an online registration.,4.0
This little elf has brought many smiles and laughs to my family this year. I'm rating it 4 out as 5 because he is a little difficult to shape and mold. A great improvement would be magnetic feet and hands and moldable arms and legs. Then he would probably be perfect.,4.0
This is a gift for our great grandson.  I am sure the family will love it. They have other children and I am sure that they will it for the whole family.,4.0
"I bought this as a gift, so I'm not sure about the durability. I do know the kids love it and are very careful not to touch him, do he doesn't lose his magic. They love finding him every morning!",4.0
We just love our Elf and definitely plan on making this a yearly tradition. My daughter loves waking up and running around looking for Elfie. I found lots of cute placement ideas on pinterest. My only complaint would be that he was bendy to sit up and pose easier but I did see there is a way to do this on pinterest so I'll have to look into this. In the meantime I find double sided sticky tapes works wonderously!,4.0
"Overall, very happy with it. So are my kids. Would have loved to give 5 stars, but the elf i received was not the one i ordered. My family loves our elf so much that I've even recommended it to some friends.",4.0
The elf on the shelf is a super cute idea but be aware it does take work!  My 8 year old and 4 year old understand the story and are very excited every morning to see where the elf ends up.  My older daughter has asked those questions you would expect. The only thing I don't like is for the kids on the fence (believe or not believe) I think that this could give some more doubt.  Probably better for ages 3-6 years. I do wish I would have got it when they were younger.,4.0
"We just bought the elf on the shelf to start as a Christmas season tradition with our little ones. We have two girls, ages 4 and 2, and they are enthralled with the elf. I have been moving him around the house when they are sleeping. So far he has been on a shelf, in the Christmas tree, in a stocking, and hanging out on the ceiling fan. The first thing they do every morning is go on an ""elf hunt"". They spend time talking to him every day, telling him things they want, trying to convince him to forget if they were bad, and highlighting nice things they did during the day. We had a great time picking a name for him. I can honestly say that knowing he is ""watching"" has given them pause a few times when embarking on questionable behavior.

The only negatives I give this product is the lack of pose-ability. If it were wired in some way to allow it to be positioned differently, or to stand, it would be a much more versatile product. I can think of tons of cute ways to set him up, but he is too floppy to do it. Also, my older daughter has been asking astute questions like how can he get places since he has no feet, etc...Had to make her believe that he flies everywhere he goes, so he doesn't NEED feet. This was rather a hard sell since she pointed out the Superman can fly and HE still has feet..so future product suggestions to help pull this off would include some little pointed shoes and some stiffening wire. It would make it that much more life-like.",4.0
"My kids were very excited to see the elf the first day that he arrived.  We read the book immediately so that they knew his story, although my son had already heard about him from the kids at school during their lunch time chats.  Each morning there is just as much excitement as the previous morning while they look to see where he has ended up.  My son is 6 and daughter is 2 (almost).  My only complaint, is that there's this big tag on the back of the elf, that unless you cut it off, your child will think it's a price tag, as my son so smartly pointed out.  It's not a price tag, but it still leads one to wonder why it's there.  I told him it was from the elf having gone to the dry cleaner and he forgot to take the tag off.  Also, the hands are sewn together.  Makes it hard to get too creative without cutting the strings.",4.0
"I recently purchased ""The Elf on the Shelf"" after my wife explained what she had heard about it. We read the book to the kids when our ""package from Santa"" arrived and they are really have a lot of fun with it. Every morning is enjoyable to watch them search the house looking for the elf with a smile on their face. This will definitely become one of our Christmas traditions and I am very excited we found out about it. They give you a website you can go on to register your elf and name him. After you do this, you get a ""letter from Santa"" thanking you, as well as, adoption papers for your elf(all in PDF form). After registration is complete, the website is fully of simple, yet fun games for the kids to enjoy(it also has Christmas recipes).",4.0
"The concept for this is awesome. I know other reviewers explained it, but basically the big secret to Santa knowing if you've been behaving is a little elf he sends to each house. When you receive your elf, you name it and can log the name with a certificate of adoption on the website. The book tells you the rules, which include not touching the elf or s/he may lose their magic. The elf has also been instructed not to talk by Santa, but you can talk to the elf. Each night, the elf will travel back to Santa and will show back up in the morning in a different spot.

My three year old really buys into the story and likes finding the elf in the morning. The older kids I know, both mine and other friends' children, really have fun looking for the elf in the morning as well. Who doesn't enjoy something so sweet and cute?

I do find this to be a bit overpriced, considering the elf is a cupie doll head with a flimsy felt body. He comes with a huge tag on his back, which I'd recommend cutting off before your child sees it if your child is skeptical about tales of Santa. The elf is supposed to sit in various places, but at only a week old, I find his body is a bit flimsy to hold up his cupie head, which takes some creative positioning from mom and dad. I do wonder how he'll hold up through the years.

The concept does make up for the actual elf though. It really is fun and helps lead up to Christmas day while encouraging solid behavior.",4.0

My son loves it! A fun family tradition. He was very excited when he found him! I would recommend this product.,4.0
I love this idea and my 3-year old daughter loves it as well.  My biggest complaint would be that the elf seems to be very cheaply made.  It is hard to get it to sit securely without propping it on something.  For $30 it seems there could be some weight in the elf's bottom or some other aid to help it sit.,4.0

"Love the idea of Elf on the Shelf. We have a two year old and he agreed on a name after we threw out about 20 to him. Our elf's name was Danny. We usually moved Danny at night, but sometimes we forgot. Our son was kind of interested in finding him in the morning, but once he spotted him, that was it. No real need to use ""Danny"" as a negotiating tool when our son was having a tantrum or picking on his baby brother since a toddler doesn't really get that yet. But, we hope to bring Danny out next year and see how much more he ""gets it"" when he is three. Definitely fun for kids and parents alike.",4.0

"I wish I could give this book 5 stars, I really do. But the Dresden Files Roleplaying Game - Volume Two: Our World requires another book (obviously a Volume One is in *that* title) to get the best mileage from the tome.

The book opens with a pretty solid foot forward - an introduction short story by the man himself, Jim Butcher. From there, we are given insights into the world of the Dresdenverse by way of the 'Unseely Accords' and an overview of the organizations that make up the 'verse. Then come the stat blocks on creatures, then character sheets, and finally a chapter outlining Chicago in game terms. But from Page One 'till the end, the book destroys all hope of reading the novels and getting most of the same information through the narrative of Harry Dresden himself; that is a *huge* strike against the book. Not everyone who picks up Volume Two is coming into this thing steeped in the lore and history. I simply cannot forgive this blindsided fault.

Most folk coming into this however are going to be Dresden fans, and they'll know everything except the game stats themselves. Of course, given the nature of character creation presented in the first book, any player can recreate the principle cast with ease, and without referring to Volume Two: Our World. Honestly, it may come down to a 'completist' urge to have both books; this second Volume simply is not *needed*.

So, two big strikes against and it still rates 4 stars. It hurt me to be *that* objective. I'm too much a fanboy myself....",4.0
"Elf on the Shelf(tm) by Carol Aebersold
*This book is part of my personal library*

Elf on the Shelf is a book the whole family will enjoy.  Each set comes with a book and a cute little Elf.  Each Elf will gain his magic once he/she has been given a name.  The names are as individual as the kids that the elves belong too and naming them is half the fun.

Each night the elves travel home to the North Pole so they can report in to Santa.  Will their child be on the naughty or nice list?  With the help of their magic, they return each morning and find a new place to sit and watch.  It's important that the children don't touch their Elf or he will lose his magic.

My granddaughter will be three in a couple of months and she received her elf this holiday season.  Naming our Elf was an adventure.  Every name we suggested she said ""No"" to so we asked if she wanted to name is ""No"" and she said YES!! So our Elf's name is Knowie.  He travels home every night and finds a new place to perch the next morning.  Each morning it's a game to find out where he is sitting and she loves it.  We have to tell him goodnight every night and make sure that she knows he's watching and will report to Santa so she'd better be good.

This is a fun book/activity for the whole family to enjoy.  Finding out where the Elf will show up next the best part, along with the threat of the ""naughty"" list (for parents).  Lilly and I give Elf on the Shelf 4 Flaming Hearts.",4.0

"The Dresden Files RPG is a staggering achievement. A system in which anything can happen, yet which folds that assumption into a structured environment that usually works predictably and well (albeit with a steep learning curve for the old-school RPG player/GM).

This review is for the hardback first edition of The Dresden Files RPG: Volume 2: Our World.

The book is well made, using identical production standards and techniques as those used in Volume 1: Your Story and reviewed by many, me included. The full-color pages are stitched into a cloth binding and bound between two sturdy cardboard covers featuring evocative artwork suitable to the milieu. Well made, and if you don't get it wet it should last for years.

The content is a mixture of stuff.

There's a section on how the various ""laws"" work to the advantage and disadvantage of the characters of the Dresden Files books, and the various factions directly involved in and with them.

There's a section on the active wars taking place as we speak in Dresden's world.

There's a section on the supernatural in Dresden Files, which also includes a ""Monster Manual"" of things that have been met, avoided or mentioned in passing in the published Dresden Files novels, along with their stats for use in the game (otherwise why have the entries on them in the first place?). This is where you'll find Ghouls, Ghosts and Sue the Zombie Tyrannosaur.

There's a section on the cast of the published stories to date (I believe there were ten books in the series at the time Our World was being compiled). This is where you'll find Marcone, Murphy and Fix.

There's a section which forms a gazetteer of Weird Chicago, the setting of the Dresden Files books (or at least, where Dresden lives and where the stories usually start). Even if you plan on not running your game in Weird Chicago, this section will be valuable in seeing what sort of things you'll have to bring to the table when you make Weird Sheboygan or (as I did for a convention recently) Weird Plainview, Weird New York. (Some might argue I cheated because New York is already weird to start with.)

It is, all in all, an indispensable book for the GM.

What I *don't* understand personally is one reviewer's comments that this book is ""better"" than Your Story. They form a complementary set for a GM - he or she will need both books to run a campaign - but players will find Our World of limited use in a game (and possibly a total spoiler bring-down into the bargain). Bottom line: You can play DFRPG with only Your Story. I can't envision the same being done with only Our World, and the publishers never intended that you should try.

If you are a GM who has purchased Your Story and you are thinking of setting your campaign in some other town than Chicago (as per the first chapters of Your Story) you will still find this volume useful, albeit not *as* useful, for its ""Monster Manual"" content (and you should keep your eyes open for a promised volume ""Dresdenifying"" Baltimore).

There's a lot to be said for relocating your own campaign to a different locale than that of the Jim Butcher books - for one, players won't keep saying ""Well, why don't we just tell Dresden and get the heck out of Dodge?""

I found the convenience of playing in the city that is well described in Butcher's books *and* depicted in the show *and* whose denizens are already statted-up (by people far more in touch with the Dresden Files universe than I will ever have time to be) to be more than enough excuse to site my game there.

(Though DFRPG characters don't really *have* stats in the traditional RPG sense they *do* have a character sheet and it can be a lot of work to figure out what should be on it for a given character when you've not much game-prep time in hand and only a passing knowledge of the character in question.)

A star falls off my review because of the same graphic design elements I found problematic in the Your Story volume (please refer to my review of that for details) and which are just as problematic in my experience in this volume, and for the lousy index, which suffers from the same problem I complained of in my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dresden-Files-Rpg-Volume-One-Your-Story/dp/0977153479/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dresden Files Rpg Volume One; Your Story</a>.",4.0
"My son got ""Joey Shelf"" as a gift from an aunt and the elf has been a lot of fun for him and his younger sister over the years. I'm sure I read the book that comes with the elf to the two of them at some point, but I guess since I didn't get all uptight about the jingle that states the elf is judging them and watching their every move and reporting to Santa whether they are being bad or good, they didn't pay much attention to it either. We have so many other beautiful Christmas books that we read during the season that the Elf on a Shelf book is not sought after or thought of as gospel when read. It truly is nothing more than magical and fun for our 7 and 5 year old, waking up every morning and trying to find Joey Shelf. Nothing is ever said about just what the elf might be reporting back to Santa. I guess for whatever reason our kids don't have days that are just so hellacious that Santa would be absolutely appalled and black marking them for no presents under the tree. They don't need an elf for one month of the year to set them straight. We don't look at the elf that way.

The only reason I didn't give the elf 5 stars is because you are expected to move the little critter every night to prove his magical abilities. It's not that hard once you get used to it. And if you do forget, come on, seriously, you can play it off. If you're relaxed about it, your kids probably will be too.

My 7 year old couldn't wait for us to put the wreath up tonight, knowing that when the wreath is up, Joey Shelf will come. The wreath is the first place we find him every year. I know that this could be his last year to ""believe"", so the excitement he finds in anything that has to do with Christmas makes that ""anything"" worth the extra effort I have to put into it during the season.

The Elf on a Shelf is not creepy and he sits easily just about any place you put him and the concept is all in what you make of it without taking it too seriously. Have fun with him (or her)!",4.0
"My sister got this for my boys (ages 2 and 6) and they loved it! It was amazing how the boys never forgot each morning that they had to go in search of ""Rocky"", their elf. The book is cute and the idea is wonderful as it makes waiting for Christmas more fun. I am ordering one of these for my best friends children and I hope they have as much fun with their elf as my boys do.",4.0
"So let me start this out by saying that I love shenanigans!!  Love it!!  Not evil shenanigans....anywho.  So I thought this toy would be awesome to ""follow"" my husband around....and it exceeded my expectations.  I anticipate the angry texts and phone calls when he finds it in his gym back, back seat of his car, eating his sandwich, and so on.  I cannot wait until my son is old enough to partake *he is currently under the age of 2.  When he is older I do think that it will be a fun game to see who spots ""Valdimir Boulderdash O'Maley"" first, but for now he just tries to stick it into his mouth.
Enough about why I personally bought this....  This toy is actually decently constructed.  The face is adorably creepy (not like Chucky or a clown doll but more like a sock monkey).  I do wish his body had some sort of wire inside to help him pose more efficiently.  Since the body is nothing more than stuffed felt, it does fit into almost any space.
The book that is included is your typical Santa Claus book.  Bad= no presents; good= presents galore.  It is cute but will not be replacing ""The night before Christmas"" or ""The Grinch"" anytime soon.  I was confused by some of the other reviews saying that they were upset that it was about commercialism that has become Christmas....ummmm der it is about an Elf that watches you for Santa.  But if that is not what you are into then this is not your product.
Overall I do think that this was a super cute idea and it is a lot of fun, but you really have to take it for what it is, an elf spy that helps Santa pass out presents.
The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because of the non-wire body.",4.0

"In the spirit of Christmas, and kids wanting to be good so Santa will come visit, this is a good toy. It comes with a book and a toy elf. Every night the elf reports back to Santa if the children have been naughty or nice. The elf moves around the house to ""spy"" on the children. It keeps parents busy moving it and children more ""aware"" of being nice. We did not receive this until after Christmas, but we wanted to make sure we had it early for next year.",4.0

I spent a couple of weeks before Christmas moving the elf around the house periodically, to my son's utter delight.  I'm not sure it improved his behavior but it brought a feeling of magic and play to the holidays.  I recommend it for kids his age!",4.0
"We love this!  My ONLY suggestion (and I might be missing the fact that one already exists with this modification) would be for the maker of this elf to add wire inside his arms and legs- that way he (Pumpkin the Elf- Don't ask, I didn't name him) would be able to be REALLY creative as to his hiding spots! He could hang from/wrap himself around anything.

Just a thought.",4.0
"We bought the Elf this year for our not-yet-two year old daughter. She LOVES this. We weren't sure if she'd catch on this young, but she looks for the elf every morning, and tells him what she wants for Christmas (a kitchen). When she's done ""helping"" me with something, she always tells me to tell the elf she helped. It's adorable, and I love that we did this this year!",4.0
What a great toy. My children go looking for the elf every morning. I love looking at there faces as they race through the house. Plus he comes back every year and I hope that my kids will pass this down to my grandkids..,4.0
"We purchased this for our 2.5 and 4.5 year old granddaughters and they love it, however I would suggest waiting until about 10 days before Christmas to begin hiding your Elf.  Also, be prepared, the 2.5 year old was a little freaked out that an elf was coming and going in and out of her home.  But overall, kids loved it and it's a great idea.",4.0
"We really enjoy the Elf on the Shelf.  My daughters (age 1 1/2 and 4) LOVE looking for him every morning.  And the story is super cute.  The website is fun, you can register your elf, give him a name and print out a really cute letter direct from Santa!!  My only complaint is the quality of the Elf himself.  He's very lightweight, and difficult to position on some surfaces.  If only his body had wires, or beads in it to pose him, would be much easier!!",4.0

The first year I was not really good about moving the elf every day, but our little one was only 2 also, so he didn't notice. We also combined this with our advent calendar saying that the elf was bringing back each little gift from Santa each day.",4.0
"I thought this was a cute idea but thought it might freak out the kids (probably b/c as a neurotic child it would have freaked me out).  But our 2.5 and 4.5 year old kids love looking for Welfie (the name my son picked out) each day.  I try to hide him in very high places so it looks like it was impossible for him to have gotten there other than by magic.  This entails climbing on tables, ladders and chairs.  They get very excited when they find him in crazy places and think it is so funny.  They call us to come see where he is.  They threw him a birthday party the other night and my son slipped him his Christmas list.  To me the idea of a spying elf is a little creepy but it works for them so that is all that matters.  I can see how some people's kids don't like it.  YMMV.  It works well every now and then to quickly stop negative behaviors.  My only complaint is that the elf should have a weighted butt so that he stays up better.",4.0
"We really love the little story and elf, it is so adorable and my 4yo daughter loves it. My only complaint is the way they beat into your head that it's going to be your new family tradition.

At the end of the book they make you write down the day you start your new tradition.

"First let me say a couple of things off the bat:

The job of designing a game system that would reproduce the events in the Dresden Files books is one I wouldn't have undertaken on a bet, but these guys have managed to figure it out. Kudos for that.

And:

I'm currently running a game of DFRPG, or trying to. Everything I'm going to say is from the heart and from experience. This is the first time I've played anything like this kind of RPG (I run Call of Cthulhu, D20 and Savage Worlds) and it has been an uphill climb to get a grasp of the system.

CAVEAT: There is an official help forum you can access to get answers to questions on this game. Unfortunately, it requires a confirmation email which for reasons beyond me never reached me in several attempts to sign up, preventing my access to the knowledge base it represents. Read accordingly.

This is a review of the Hardback version of the Your Story book for Dresden Files Roleplaying Game.

The game system may have started life as a FATE-based one, but it morphed in the process into something that bears no resemblance I can see to the currently downloadable version of FATE. If you have prior experience of FATE-style games I've no doubt you'll have an easier ride learning DFRPG. I don't, and got no helpful insights from reading the current FATE rules.

The rules system is by necessity very involved (not difficult; involved). It is my opinion that a GM new to FATE-style games would need to read just about the entire book before it began to make complete sense. This has certainly been my experience. Skimming the rules proved to be inadequate to running the game this time (I'm a GM of 35 years standing in many other game systems).

I also find myself paging madly back and forth as I examine this or that aspect of the game. I don't doubt this is a learning curve issue but that curve is extremely steep, much steeper than any other system I've had in my hands.

Is it all worth it? I think so. I'm certainly still running a game twice a month for a keen group, though three months and six sessions in we're still having problems with the mechanics because they are so different to our gaming community's other RPGs. I think the payoff will be worth it. I hope so.

Clearly I'm not the best person to talk to on the mechanics, and I'll happily cede that the other reviewers have more knowledge and a better take on the whole thing. My perception of the game system complexity isn't why stars fell off this review.

[EDIT 11/22/13] I never did properly understand how the ""Fate Point Economy"" worked from the information in this book, but because I often don't know when I'm beat I picked up a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fate-Core-System/dp/1613170297/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fate: Core System</a>&nbsp;and after a few minutes reading had my Fate Point Economy epiphany. Now I want to try the DFRPG again.[/EDIT]

Production-wise the book is a hardback, with a cloth binding to which the signatures have been stitched. It should last for many many games providing you don't get it wet (glossy pages don't survive moisture well). Well done Evil Hat for getting the book's construction right.

The pages are glossy, as I said, with full color illustrations derived (I think) from the graphic novels. Each page is colored and decorated as though it were part of a spiral-bound magical notebook, and the text is littered with post-its, blue highlighter and marginalia purportedly between the collaborators of the design team.

And that's why the stars fall off this review.

The graphic designers have gone to a great deal of trouble to make the book look like a work-in-progress, with notes from ""Billy"" the RPG designer and ""Harry"" a playtester, and with the occasional aside from ""Bob"". Sometimes this stuff clarifies a rule, much as a sidebar would in any other rulebook. Sometimes they are simply running in-jokes.

I found the joke content got old (very old very fast) when I began to struggle with the internals of the system itself. It got in the way. It used space, driving up cost of ownership. It was distracting. It was, and remains, annoying. Your mileage may vary.

The index is also particularly vexing. In at least one case the only reference to the subject I was looking for resolved (eventually, after much searching the page text) to a stupid joke post-it. Call me finicky, but indexing the jokes in preference to actual useful entries is unhelpful and worth dropping one star. Indexing them at all was a questionable decision in my opinion.

So, to sum up: Flexible (but complex) game rules with a steep learning curve for Trad. RPG fans, achieves the very difficult goal of modeling events in the DF books, sturdily bound but marred for me by the desire to ""gussy up"" the contents in a way I found intrusive and unhelpful.

You are going to need FUDGE dice. Cheapest option for the GM:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fudge-Dice-GMs-Multi-Color/dp/B004CHMBTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fudge Dice GMs Multi-Color</a>.

No more ""helpful"" votes for that literary gem then.[/EDIT]

"I like the way this is written. The text itself is easy to understand and that makes learning the rules easier. All of the ""notes"" in the margins from the characters is great for explanations, examples, and breaking up the monotony that texts like these often have. I look forward to playing with my friends!",4.0
"My first exposure to the aspects of the Fate system.  I love how expansive and enabling the mechanics are and how the rules set supports the setting.  It does suffer in a few points from being too accurate to the book, particularly around magic.  IT also seems to sport some balance issues and is best used for a strong story driven table, over a mechanically crunchy approach.",4.0
"The Dresden Files RPG is a great game and it uses a great system, however, it is flawed by being way to convoluted in some aspects and the thamaturgy rules are incredibly complex. I played Fate Core first then moved on to the Dresden Files RPG even though I got the DFRPG first because the rules were getting a bit over my head. To be fair, this is because the DFRPG is using an older version of Fate that, by Evil Hats own admission, was a little TOO indepth and complex

For example, in Fate Core, you start off with a high concept aspect (what your character is all about), a trouble aspect (a running theme of problems for your character), and a regular aspect (just something about your character flesh them out a little) and you can get up to two more as the game progresses. Aspects are invoked for all kinds of reasons by the player as long as they are relevent in some way to the task at hand. For example, if my high concept was 'Internationally known strong man' I can invoke this aspect to a bonus to get into a crowded bar because I am famous, I can invoke it to perform a feat of strength, or the DM can use it against me by making it difficult me for me to not call attention to myself because so many people know me. With 3 aspects it is great for beginners to learn the basics of how to invoke these aspects and it limits all the stuff the GM has to keep up with for random invoking and such when he is new. 5 is solid for advanced players who are into a pretty epic game with established characters and DM who knows what he doing really well.

The DFPRG STARTS with SEVEN aspects per character, NPC, location, and enemy (yes, locations and items have aspects to for example a back alley can be 'slippery when wet' and 'well hidden' with a trouble being 'rats everwhere' and those can come into play during any encounters, investigations, etc that goes on there). It continues until players have a total of NINE aspects.

If this is your first outing with Fate, DFRPG is a meaty, meaty game that takes time and patience to learn for the GM and the players, however, if you get the hang of it, understand the rules, and it clicks with all the players you will be hard pressed to find a more rewarding and enjoyable RPG experience.",4.0
"I've been playing RPGs for years, but this is the first time I've gotten an RPG rulebook as an ebook.

I'm looking forward to using this game.",4.0
"My husband and I ordered this game to add to our collection for Family Game nights. The first night we played it, we could not stop. It was so, so fun, even though he kept winning.

Overalll, I'd recommend it if you get it on sale...it's pretty fun!",4.0
"This was a cute game I got for my 24 yr old Sister and her Boyfriend.  We played it the night I gave it to her.  Although it is a fun game, we didn't play the full round of wins (Olives).  At least for that night, is was not able to keep our attention.  I'm sure we will play it again.",4.0

"Great game for keeping the mind engaged.  It is a really fun game, but definitely depends on the crowd.  Our family is very into board games, and this reminds us of the original Balderdash, we have enjoyed playing it so far.",4.0
"I got this game as a birthday present in February. I finally got around to opening it and brought it to my Sunday game group. They liked it a lot. During the first round, one player fooled three of the other four players with his bluff answer. One other person actually knew the correct answer to two of the phrases and wrote it down, before hearing the choices. This game is similar to Balderdash and Malarky in which players submit bluff answers and then try to guess which of the answers is the correct one. I like games that involve bluffing, so I'll definitely be bringing this game back to the group on a regular basis. The only problem with games like this is sometimes you can't read an answer because the person's handwriting is awful. Other than that, a good game where you can learn something.",4.0

"This game is essentially a Balderdash knock off, but it's fun and worth adding to your collection.  My family and I have had many side-splitting laughs playing ""Origin.""",4.0
"If you've every enjoyed Balderdash, you'll love Origin.  The game is simple, but fun, and rarely dominated by any one player. The mechanics are simple:
1. the reader draws a card that lists a common phrase such as ""cat got your tongue""
2. Every player writes down on a piece of paper their explanation for where the phrase came from. (the player that's reading simply  copies the ""real"" answer from the card""
3. The reader collects all answers, and then reads them out loud.
4. Each player selects the explanation that they think is correct, and the the reader reveals the truth.
5. Players score 1 point for each person that guesses his or her explanation.  Each player that selects the right answer gets a bonus point.  If no player selects the right answer then the reader gets a bonus.
6. The next player becomes the reader.

Very simple, but tons of fun.  There are enough different phrases in the box to keep it interesting for a good long time.

My only complaint is that the correct answers are written much more formally than most people write.  So if the reader copies them word for word, it is usually pretty easy to detect the correct answer.  When we play we have the reader paraphrase the correct answer to make it more challenging.",4.0

This expansion continues the ""dots"" system for additional rules, which works really well.  The best addition in my opinion is the use of barricades.  You have fortify any building on the board, making it harder for zombies to get in.  The additional decks are fun too, and they add another role-playing element to the game.",4.0
"So this product was on back order for a really long time and after almost of year of waiting I finally got it.  I haven't got a chance to play it yet, but it arrived fast, and was in perfect condition.",4.0
"A few extra scenarios never hurt, zombies with grave weapons makes the already tough to kill zombies harder to kill and really adds to the game. I wish they would have boxed this with the heroes mentioned in the new cards and on the box, but you have to buy them separately.  I would have rather paid a little more and gotten them in the same expansion.  Great addition to the game overall!",4.0
"This expansion, amidst all the other Last Night on Earth expansions, is a bit of a gamechanger. The contents of the box may pale in comparison with the contents of Growing Hunger, but don't be fooled. This expansion introduces new cards for both heroes and zombies as well as several new sets of rules (including barricades and sewers). On top of that, it does include new scenarios, which is always a plus.

All of this new stuff may complicate the game a little, but it also can help to keep things fresh. It allows both zombie and human players to try different strategies and approaches. Absolutely worth considering if you're a fan of Last Night on Earth.",4.0
"This was a good Christmas gift for my teen; it's not getting as much use as some of the others, but he obviously relishes the fun of insults in the Shakespearean style.  A fun gift, not too expensive.  It was worth it for the smiles it generates whenever it's discussed.",4.0

"Okay, my title might be a bit confusing.  I will get back to that.  My neice and nephews came over on New Year's Day and I brought this out after everyone finished eating and carrying on.  They all loved it, but it would probably be better to bring out in the beginning of a party or get-together so you don't necessarily think it's someone trying to get you to do something solely for the game.  For instance, if you are trying to get a person to say ""no"" to getting you a drink.  You ask them without having them realize that it is the game that you are playing.  Thus, if you are carrying on and talking, one might think you really do want them to get it for you.  I hope I made that clear enough.  So just ""play"" it while you are chatting and not an intense ""game"".  They all loved it though.",4.0
"Party Gras is one of those games that had our family talking a lot about it. That is a good thing.  The game is supposed to get people in a group talking and interacting especially at parties and other fun oriented gatherings.  The game comes with a bunch of beautiful colored beads and cards.  The idea is that you have three cards and have to pick one of the things on the cards you are going to use to trap or take beads from others.

The interactions for the most part are fun and silly, but once in a while they are downright stupid and on occasion insulting.  I mean, in most groups I am in, I would not want to emulate a dog lifting its leg to spray territory.  For the most part, however, trying to get someone to stay or do something might be on the cards such as trying to get someone to tell you their favorite something-or-other.  They immediately might say no but that could be what is really on your card- it could be to get them to REFUSE to do something.  That does cause some laughs and fun.

I thought this game was quite a bit of fun, but some of my family members thought it was not as fun as they had hoped it would be, but they did appear to enjoy it anyway.

I recommend this game heartily with reservations if you have the time to scan the cards and remove a few of the less tasteful cards before guests arrive in situations where you think it appropriate to do so.  The beads are pretty, the game play is fast and we all laughed a lot, however, it is just a fun game with no real competition, more just time for laughing and being silly.",4.0
"We got this in time to bring along with us to a few holiday time gatherings and in every situation, the game seemed to take on a life of its own.  A large part of how successful the game will be depends on the people you are playing with.  If you have some particularly manipulative players, you'll end up having a few paranoid guests who are convinced that EVERYTHING that ANYONE is doing is a ploy to get their beads... and they are probably right.

The first time we played, I brought the game along to a game night where there were a total of 5 guests.  Although the rules say that the dealer can set the time, we ended up playing for much longer than the original set time and keeping the game running in the background as we played a couple other games.

We took it to a few places after that and in small groups we followed the rules pretty well, but in larger groups, we just used the cards and the beads and let the game run its course. The largest group we played with was about 25 people at a Christmas party - we didn't even explain the rules, just handed people beads and a card and in minutes people had figured things out and were running around trying to collect more beads and get more cards.  It was a ton of fun.

The only downside I saw in this game was the packaging.  Although I like the handy handle and don't mind the plastic exterior, the boxing inside is flimsy and fell apart after trying to pull the contents out and in a number of times.  It would work better if the entire top of the game case would come almost entirely unzipped so you wouldn't have to pull the materials out and shove them back in when the game is done.

This game proved to be so simple and so fun that I will continue to bring this game to parties and game nights from here on out.",4.0
"We have large family gatherings at Thanksgiving and Christmas and I thought Party Gras would be a fun sitting around the living room kind of game, and it is.

The game includes 36 strings of beads, 300 Party Gras Cards and directions, and the zippered bag it comes in is perfect for storage.  The cards to the game include things such as Mind Control....get someone to go to the kitchen, Caught in the Act.....catch someone talking about the weather, Fashion Police.....find someone without jewelry or a watch, Challenge Cards, Go Crazy Cards, each different task tells you how many beads you can 'steal'.

What's fun about this game is that it can go for any amount of time, 5 min, an hour, however long you decide.  At the end of the time limit the person with the most beads wins.

Imagine a serious relative drawing a card where they have to Jump up and down and scream ""I want to win this game"" 3 times, this game is sure to loosen up even the most tightly wound people!

As far as durability, these are the mardi gras beads you can buy at dollar stores, etc. and the cards are your typical game cards, the bag is plastic with a zipper and handle, so as long as you use common sense I don't see any problems with durability.

Our family had quite a bit of fun with this game, and I think it's a game that will be used frequently.

I received this game in exchange for review from the Amazon Vine program.",4.0
"If you're looking for a game to play after a big dinner & drinks, sitting around full & sleepy on the couch, look elsewhere.  This game requires standing and walking about.  It also requires a crowd willing to try something different and be a little uninhibited.

If you're looking for something fun to do either as an ice-breaker or a family game, this game can be really fun!  We played it twice over Christmas, with a crowd of 10 - 12, aged 10 - 75.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Basically, there are mardi gras beads which are shared out equally.  And there are cards with a bunch of challenges on them (find someone with a nose smaller than yours, make someone look at their shoes, catch someone asking for help, get someone to refuse to massage your shoulders, etc). Every person has 2 cards - when you have played one you discard and pick another. Everytime you successfully play a card (complete one of the 3 tasks on it), you take a necklace from the person you 'played'.  (There are also a few extra cards like Go Crazy - e.g. spin around 10x and take 2 necklaces from the person of your choice.) At a pre-established time the game ends, and the person with the most necklaces wins.  It's less confusing than it sounds-- it's difficult to explain.

NOTE:  Before we tried it I didn't understand how you could ever 'play' someone  -- they know you are trying to get them to do something from your card so as to steal their necklace, so why would they do it?  BUT there is a rule that everyone must answer all questions honestly (e.g. Do you have a tattoo?  Have you been to Disney World in the past 5 years? etc).  Also SOME tasks are to get someone to REFUSE something (so you don't know if someone wants you to take out the trash, or if they want you to say no), and also some tasks are just about seeing someone laugh, or finding someone shorter than you, etc.

NOTE 2:  The game doesn't get repetitive quickly, as there are many cards, and each of them has 3 choices of tasks -- so someone could discard a card without anyone in the room ever hearing what 2/3 of the tasks are.

NOTE 3:  It says 13 and up but anyone who can read can play; it's not like the questions are at all 'adult' in nature.

BOTTOM LINE:  Fun for the right time, the right crowd.  Needs people with energy and a good sense of silly.  I would guess that the ideal amount of players would be between 6 - 10.",4.0

He beat me by 14 points! It was very exciting. Just like real games you just don't know what's going to happen on each play. My teenagers and I love it!,4.0
"Before I got this, I was using a card collector's box to keep all of my Red Dragon Inn decks together. This not only holds all of the cards, but all of the coins, has new score trackers that don't take up a lot of space, and comes with some interesting new decks. My biggest complaint is the price, but if you're a fan with everything, it's definitely worth it.",4.0
"The box is huge, but it's not quite big enough! The one disappointment that I have with this product is that they included character-specific boards and I guess by doing so they tried to obsolete the older big brown boards that you get 4 of in each of the main game packs (RDI 1-4). However, we much prefer those boards, so we don't want to get rid of them... however, they don't easily fit in this box! That's disappointing for something that is supposed to be the ""end-all"" storage solution for this series.

Other than that, this is great. The characters are all fun and each have their own unique characteristics. Lizwick has a separate item deck that she can draw from to get (mostly) beneficial cards. This is balanced by the fact that all other players see what kind of benefits she is getting from the items, so they can plan accordingly. Sera is like a ninja - she dodges a lot and can hit you with a lot of quick, small attacks; including some action cards that can't be negated and others that allow her to play another action card on the same turn (although most of these are for just 1 fortitude loss, so it takes time for their effects to add up). Joran the ""trickster"" has a lot of ""gotcha"" cards to try to mess with other players - spiking their drinks, re-directing damage, cheating for gambling, etc. And then Zakhan introduces his own unique mechanic where he can choose to gain ""drunken chi"" that will allow him to deal more damage later, but it also puts him at risk of being knocked out sooner.

Sera is a little boring to play as, but I find the other 3 pretty entertaining. Joran is probably one of my top 5 favorites overall in the whole series (Dimli, Phrenk, Serena, Halden, Joran, not necessarily in that order) and then both Lizwick and Zakhan are fun as well. Definitely a worthwhile addition!",4.0
"I love Red Dragon Inn, and this collector's box is great!  Comes with a lot of extras, custom character cards for all the decks, and plenty of options for sorting/organizing/storing. I haven't played with any of the decks that come with the box, so I can't speak to the gameplay aspects.  I really got it mostly for the box.

The one thing I will say is: This Box Is Big!  It's much bigger than the boxes of the previous editions I have (obviously), and it's longer than the shelves for game storage.

If you love Red Dragon Inn and have a lot of the expansions, this is a great place to store your decks and everything else.",4.0
"The game itself is a five-star game, but I give this volume four.  The idea of having one box to hold the entire franchise is nice, but it is VERY large (won't fit on any of my shelves that hold board games).  Also, keep in mind you still only get one set of characters.  There is a plethora of cardboard pieces for larger games, but you still only get four characters.  In my opinion, the price was a little high for the product, but I am overall very happy with not having to haul four boxes to play one game.",4.0
"Love that you can fit all the things in this box! It makes for such a better organized space. Wish it  would've been maybe double stacked inside the box with like the cards at the bottom, then a try insert above it for all the boards and coins and such. It would be a bit taller but not as awkward wide and big. I had all of my Red Dragon Inns in my game cabinet. This is too big and has to sit on top. Plus side more room for new games! Down side this one gets dusty.",4.0
"Bigger than you would expect. Room to expand beyond what is available today. The only problem with it was there was not quite enough overall height to store all the booklets and health tracking cards on the top, but I have a lot of extra of those.",4.0
Love this game! I Would appreciate maybe more clarity on where this game falls the series of packs because this is actually #5 but it's the biggest box created to hold all the other packs. Really fun game and a great product.,4.0
It is a huge box.  I only hope that they release enough expansions to fill it. I appreciate that it comes with foam blocks to secure the cards (and dividers).,4.0
"Another Great Expansion for Red Dragon Inn.  However, If you are adding this to Red Dragon Inn 2, be aware that the card sizes and tokens are all a different size.",4.0
"a nice addon to a great game, just be sure that you don't anger Pooky!...for the love of god don't make him angry!",4.0
"If Pooky belonged to a version of Red Dragon Inn, it would be RDI III.  His character is just slightly more complicated to use than the characters in RDI I or RDI II, but still easy to use and fun.",4.0
"At this point in time I own all the RDI expansions and decks. Pooky came as a refreshing addition with a lot of adorable card art (including pulling Zot out of a hat).

Pooky shares similar traits with Natyli in terms of their lack of defense cards. Pooky only has a couple, and his best cards come into play with the use of his Anger Meter, an additional mechanic that gives him a range of damage on several of his cards. Arguably, being Psychotic (the highest tier of his meter) is best bet for Pooky to be a real contender, but to do so he has to take some damage.

Pooky comes off like a berserker, but he's really more of a glass cannon who excels at early game but has trouble near the end. If he can fly under the radar and avoid being a direct target so that he gets to end game in fairly good condition, he has a chance to win. That said, sometimes Pooky is best off being very aggressive in early game (he has two small heals that become practically useless once other characters have a certain level of Alchohol), so that he leaves characters more vulnerable for the final showdown. If the other character is anything but a Gambler, Pooky's chance of winning one on one plummets pretty hard, since he has less ability to take and disperse drinks and damage.

Even though he's hard to win with under less than perfect conditions, he's still a lot of fun to play. He has a lot of high damage cards and the ability to wail on the entire party with some of the highest (natural) damage dealing cards in the entire series.

Recommended if you like a challenge. :)",4.0
"This is a nice extra character with a neat mechanic of getting more ""psychotic."" The mechanic doesn't seem to affect much though as most cards you play aren't affected by the mechanic, but if you like the Red Dragon Inn games, it's a nice addition.",4.0
"It came sooner than expected, though one of the cards was 'scrunched' up at the side, looking like it had been smashed in, through the protective plastic, it's odd but that's the only complaint I had.",4.0

"I'm just gonna say, this is the funniest game....like wear a depends funny.  I bought it for a family game night where I invited many different families.  It was hilarious.  I gave only four stars because:  the mouth pieces are a little rough on the mouth; if you get a small size you can rig the game (the younger ones figure this out but quick) and the hilarity wears out kind of quickly.  But, overall, it's very fun and a game we will break out often.  I did buy extra mouth pieces.",4.0

"Santa brought this gift for our family and it didn't disappoint.  It really helps to know the people who are playing though.  When it was my turn, my husband almost always had the ""right"" answer.  However, it did prompt to be more creative with their answers.  The issuing of points seemed a little skewed, the person who guessed the answer the judge choose may not get any points if other players didn't select that answer; we changed that to give more incentive to  thinking up really good responses.
Good family game, had us all laughing and with a 14 and 10 year that don't always get along - laughing and having fun was the point!",4.0
"We had a lot of laughs playing this game with the family since we've bought it.

I have a brother and we're mostly like polar opposites with the way we think, do things, and the things we like. Yet, somehow when playing this game, we can come to think similarly. We get a question, and it's something like, ""What's the most complicated thing in the world?"" And he and I both wrote very quickly and put down the same answer. It was hilarious.

The only reasons why I don't totally love this game is because:
1) You're limited to 6 people unless you add external components to allow more players (extra pencils, paper, etc.)
2) Questions are sometimes difficult to select from because although you would be interested to see what others would write, if they all don't really know you and maybe one person knows you, then you'll either get 1 good answer and the rest will be bad, or they'll all be bad. Then it gets uninteresting. It's fun when everyone can answer the question at a competitive level though - but finding a question for this is hard.
3) This ties in to #2 - although I don't really care since I only play with family anyway, I think it will be difficult for people to ask these questions with strangers or friends of friends. The less you know about the person asking, you're less likely to write a good answer unless you get a silly question and can write a silly/clever answer. Yes, this game is titled ""Say Anything - Family Edition"", but I am inclined to take this game as a party game with family-safe questions, rather than a game you're pretty much only playing with family and no one else.
4) The equipment supplied is on the cheap side. The markers dried out quickly and there weren't felt cloths to wipe the boards so we often had to remember to find paper towel to share.

Of course, with all that said, we still had a lot of fun with this game. I bought/played this after we've had Telestrations, and I think with Telestrations beating this on all points stated above, Telestrations is an overall better game - but you'll still have fun playing this. If you play this game with the ""scoring/winning conditions"" as Telestrations though (that is, not caring too much about the final points but about the laughs along the way) then you'll probably enjoy it as much as Telestrations. This game has an advantage over Telestrations that it doesn't require the players to be artistically inclined in order to have an advantage at playing though - so if your group would prefer not to draw, then this is a great substitute.",4.0

There is a lot of room built into this game to make sure everyone can win, at least, some points because you don't want them to get aced out. Only the scorekeeper has the ability to cheat at this game, making this a good clean, fun, interactive family game.",4.0
I purchased this game for my great grand sons for Christmas.  My grand daughter was excited to get it and was looking forward to having a family night so they could all play it together.

"We enjoyed this game, but there were only three of us playing. It says for 3 to 6 players, but I think four or more would be more fun. We also were unsure about how to answer. The card says, ""In my opinion..."" but we are sure if we should answer with our opinion or what we think the judge would say. We enjoyed playing, just a bit confused at times.",4.0
We love playing this game! We are a three person family and it is not great for just three (but that doesn't stop us) so we also play with other families. We have played with kids as young as 7 years old and there are a few questions here and there they simply won't get so just skip those. But other than that they have some great answers! It would get 5 stars if you had enough cards for more than 6 people. But 6 players is still a fun game and it moves really fast - the smaller kids won't get bored.,4.0
"We played this at Christmas with the whole family - the questions might seem aimed at children, but you should have seen the thoughtful adult faces when everyone had to give ""Your best time ever"". And when my son-in-law misread a question and asked ""Can you dress yourself?"" we all laughed until we cried.  Each card has a choice of 3 questions, so there is always something that fits the players.  People came and went as kids or activities needed attention with no problem.  We all learned a few things about each other and possibly ourselves.",4.0

I did not want her to be sad (when she should be super happy/excited) so we said he could stay longer and I tried to explain he is just for fun.

Christopher did his job this Advent.  The kids paid more attention to their actions and were overall better behaved than they likely would have been without him.  He has started a new tradition in our family.  The kids are already wondering if he will know where to find us when we move.  I suspect he will -unless the movers mess up.,4.0

"This elf is a little cheaper than the original ""Elf on the Shelf"" and it's not creepy looking. I paid $20 for this one, where the other is $30.",4.0
"If you're here, you're no doubt trying to decided between the Elf on the Shelf and Christopher Popinkins. First of all, understand that in concept they're both meant to hide in your house and leave to report back to Santa every night, then return in a new hiding spot. Children aren't techincally allowed to touch either of them or they have to go back to the North Pole early. Neither book mentions the pranks you see on Pinterest, blogs, and maybe your Facebook newsfeed, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. So what are the differences? Here are my pros and cons:

Pro - Cuteness factor. I get a bit of a sly-vibe from EotS, but that could just be me. Christopher is all cuteness.
Con - He comes already named, and since the book calls him Christopher, it would be hard to change. There's no good explanation for why someone else would have this *exact* elf with the same name in their house. With EotS all the identical elves have unique names.
Pro - He has a little sister named&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pop-In-Kins-Elf-Pop-In-Kins-Christina-Marie-Bookset/dp/B004478BTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pop In Kins Elf Pop-In-Kins Christina Marie Bookset</a>, who I'm sure will visit us next year, and unlike the EotS ""girl"", Christina Marie is very girly looking. Two elves!
Con - Both books are hardcover and of comparable quality, but I think the EotS box is nicer. Christopher's box is nice, and it also comes with a nice sleeve for the book, but the EotS version is more durable.
Pro - Chistopher is secular, while there is a mention of 'say your prayers' in the EotS book.
Con - Christopher's book does not rhyme. I like rhyming. Christopher has a poem, but his book isn't written in rhyme.
Pro - I think Christopher has a nicer story, the emphasis is less on ""watching"" and more on ""visiting"". He was sad that he made toys for children he never got to meet. He really wanted to meet the children so Santa sent him to watch the kids as a lookout.
Pro - Christopher is posable. To pose EotS parents have to resort to rubber bands and bits of wire, but Christopher has bendy arms and legs, much easier.

Also it's worth noting that Christopher's story is a lot longer than EotS, if that's a pro or a con depends on your point of view.

"I ordered this little guy last year after Christmas and was so excited to get started on it this year.  I read the other reviews that the elf didn't come with the book, mine did, so no problem there.  He is the perfect size and the kids have had so much fun searching him out and seeing what he has gotten into.  He is just like the elf on a shelf except this is a little cheaper.  The quality is great and the box that he stays in along with the sleeve for the book is sturdy. My kids loved the book that explained all about Pop-In-Kins.  I can't wait to break him out year after year each December.  There are so many inspiration and ideas for him on pinterest and plenty of ways for him to be mischievous.  I did minus one star just for the fact that he doesn't bend as well as I hoped.  Still, plenty of fun",4.0
"I ordered Christopher... but received his sister, Christina. It's a cute story, the elf seems well made... and not as creepy as the other ""elf on a shelf"".",4.0
"We choose this elf over the seemingly more popular alternative in hopes that it would be more friendly-looking than its elf counterpart.  Success!  The kids are enjoying looking for the elf every morning not cowering.  The book is OK.  Its main benefit is providing the back story for the elf, why it is around the house and some ground rules (such as no touching or back to the North Pole I go).  I liked how the story was written in a way that encouraged positive behaviors without a big brother is watching you vibe.  If you are looking for an elf to visit during the holidays, I would go with Pop-in-Kins.",4.0
"the Elf on the Shelf must have a more powerful family at the North Pole than Christopher, because this fella' is definitely cuter and he arrives with posable appendages!  The story is a bit long, but the pictures are fantastic and the book as a whole is readable.  I wish there was more emphasis on the ""do not touch"" aspect in the story as all my littles want to do is touch him.",4.0
"I am very pleased with the quality of this little guy and the book. It's great that the elf has posable arms and legs so he can grab on to things. The more well known ""Elf on the Shlef"" does not and frankly I find that elf to be creppy looking anyway. My one gripe would be that the way the story is written it doesn't really catch a childs attention. It is a fun storyline, but could have been told in less pages OR even better, there could have been more of a story behind it rather than just a crying sad elf that wanted to see kids.

My son is young enough not to know what I am reading anyway so I just kind of made up a story as I went along.

It has been realy fun coming up with ideas for this elf and my son loves looking for him when he gets up in the morning. His birthday is right after thanksgiving and when he woke up for his birthday I told him I did not have time to decorate, but I did wrap his presents. Christopher decorated for us though and was found perched on the top of a balloon that had been tacked to the wall. He also hid my sons presents for him to find.

If you are trying to find away to bring some more magic into the holiday for your little one this is a great way to do it!",4.0
"Received this item the day before Thanksgiving.  Yeah!  I can start on time this year.

I noticed that Barnes and Noble carried Christopher Pop-in-kins online, and since it was the only store I could find it at, I went into my local Barnes and Noble and was greated with the popular Elf on the Shelf instead.  Seriously, there were thousands of those creepy dolls at literally every corner of my bookstore.  I am not one who starts telling my kid months in advanced that Santa is watching, and I wasn't going to get a doll whose primary ""job"" is keeping an eye on my kid's behavior.  At last, I decided to order Christopher from amazon.

Christopher's head, scarf, mittens, and shoes are all cheap plastic that has been painted and he looks cheaper than I expected.  I was hoping that he would be very well made so that he could be passed down thru the generations.  Although he seems durable, I am not pleased with the defects from the plastic being painted and the molds obviously being assembled quickly.  I will keep an eye out for a better made cute elf that will be a beautiful addition to our holidays and that will replace this.

Bottom line, he is way better than the other popular option, and I will use him until I find an elf better than this.  The story is cute.",4.0
"This is a SUPER CUTE elf but beware, if your child is already aware of the creepy popular one, she/he may be disappointed in this elf.  I purchased this for nieces and nephews, and two of the three kids weren't convinced that it was the real elf...they basically claimed fraud!!  Yikes!  The other child was too young to know better. (Her mom was happy to receive this version because it was bendable and the other one gave her the creeps.)  :)",4.0

"I agree with a previous review---which said ""My only word of caution is that if you have a child who still believes and can read, be sure to cut out the dedication page in the book, which essentially gives the secret away. I almost didn't catch it and I know my voracious reader would have seen it right away... and honestly, as short as childhood is these days, I want her to hang on to the magic and wonder of Christmas for as long as she can. :)"" So because I read that I tore it out...
well.... my daughter was so excited about christopher when he arrived today! so excited, then when she started questioning it and reading the box outload....I nearly jumped out of my seat when she started reading ""how to play"", which apparently was what the elf is attached to when he arrived....ugh so bummed. She said so its a game and YOU hide the elf....luckily my husband tried to talk it down and said no its that the adults can help guide him to find good hiding places....not sure if she bought it....",4.0
"Hes cute, has bendable arms and legs. Comes with a hardback book that my daughter loved to hear (shes 7). She is always looking for the elf to see what hes up to.
So far he has TP'd our living room so she woke up to toilet paper all over the living room.
He turned the milk blue, in the fridge.
Climbed up the tree.
Tried to eat cookies and milk.

So much to do with him :)

Cons: why is this thing so expensive? Same with Elf on the Shelf.
Made in China
His head doesnt really turn so its hard to get a good position.",4.0
I am a first grade teacher and I cannot wait to read this with my kids and hide the elf in my classroom! We will enjoy this for many years to come!,4.0
As soon as she arrived I had to read the story and it was so cute and sweet that I ended up ordering her brother christopher as I think his story will be different and probably just as cute. I am going to give Christopher to my two year old son this year and save Christina for my daughter for next year.  I just have to have both!!  Cant wait for Christopher to arrive!!,4.0
"I purchased this to begin a new tradition for our 7 year old.  She absolutely loved Christopher and was sad that he had to go.  I personally preferred this over the elf on the shelf which has become pretty commercialized, making it much more believable that this is a REAL elf from Santa Workshop.  We did decide to downplay the visit as something more fun vs. him being there to watch over her.  My daughter is pretty sensitive and didn't want her to be creeped out that this little guy was watching her.",4.0

"This game reminds us all of the Twister game, but is designed for younger participants.  We played on Christmas
Day, my 3yr old grandson, parents and grandma did pretty well. It will provide lots of exercise and a learning
experience also.",4.0
"My ESL kids like this game.  However, we can hardly ever win all the cards when you have to put your ear to one item.  Maybe they should change that  to a different body part.  It is a good twist on Twister and the kids can practice their alphabet and vocabulary.",4.0
"We received this game yesterday and have played it several times both yesterday and today. My three year old daughter likes playing the ""stretchy"" game. The mat seems very durable(it did have a strong vinyl odor, which is fading). I like that it doesn't have many cardboard pieces, the letter coins are all hard plastic. I would like this game more if it had both upper and lower case versions of the letters, I also think some of the letter pictures are a little confusing, when I asked my daughter what the picture was for the letter E she was more focused on the skateboard that the elephant was on than the elephant, I know the pictures are supposed to be Dr. Seuss'y' but I also feel that the pictures should contain only things that begin with that letter, and be a little more clear, the train is hard to tell it's a train. Overall, a fun game for calling out letter names and some word association in conjunction with a bit of silly wiggle time, but I would not depend on this for learning ABC's",4.0
"My 4yr old daughter received this as a gift, and we all love it. We play several times in a row as it's good holding my daughter's attention. It's good to practice letter recognition & sounds but mostly it's just fun to watch each other stretch & twist into position. Great game!",4.0
"We purchased this game for our 4.5 year old daughter after playing some of the other cat in the hat games.  I thought that it would be a little more like twister but it is basically a 'horseshoe' shaped map with letters (and words corresponding to those letters) on the horseshoe.  You then have another part of the game which is the letter assigner that you spin and get letters assigned that you have to put hands, feet, and an ear on.

As far as difficulty, it is as difficult as you want it to be.  Our daughter has been doing physical therapy to catch up to her classmates and that is why this toy intrigued us.  It is very good in that way as she has to work on core strength and balance to get to all of the letters.  But nothing in the game says that you have to get them all each time.

I wonder how much educational value it has though. The player must identify what letter they need to be standing on, but for our daughter this was a minimal task.

In conclusion, one month out from getting the game and our daughter still enjoys playing it.  Great team building as you can cheer each other on.  It is a durable product, but it does have a lot of parts (mainly the letter disks and feet) that could get lost (oh yeah forgot about the cards.)  It would still be a strong recommend in my book.",4.0
"This Dr Suess game is an excellent play on the beloved classic - Twister.  The mat is small enough for little bodies, and the option to use pictures or letters is great.  Currently, we are on pictures, but we do try some letters each time.  My daughter is four and really enjoys this game - she likes watching me try to contort on the little mat as well.",4.0
"Great game but do not let this retailer rip you off - I was so disappointed in Amazon to see that this 3rd party retailer is trying to sell this game for $49.  Is is selling for $14 at T-R-S, and $15 or $16 at most mass retailers.  Get the game, but pay a resonable price for it!",4.0
"My 3 and 5 year old really enjoyed this game.  It was a different way to learn the letters of the alphabet, which is a good thing considering that all kids learn differently.  It is like ""twister"" for toddlers, although depending on the random letters that are generated, it was nearly impossible to touch all of them at the same time.  It's educational and great for busy little bodies that can't play a traditional board game.",4.0

I've taken some online courses for the subject and none of them have provided information so easily assimilated as I have found with these cards.

Obviously that's not much of a negative.",4.0
"The cards were great and in an order that made sense (similar terms/topics).  It was easy to grab some of the pile and bring it with me to use when I had a free moment.  You will still need to come up with a plan for study that will require you to route through the cards to find the most relevant to you.  If the manufacturers are reading this, I believe it would be beneficial to band and label terms from different areas of study.  If I know I'm solid in most knowledge areas but need help in some others, it would be great to easily be able to identify and separate the relevant cards.  Otherwise, they are great. Very comprehensive.",4.0

These were great for fitting in study time while stuck in stopped traffic or on my lunch break. They focus on some of the more important points and are a great supplement to other study materials.

"I really love the Adventure deck. As the description says, it has a number of cool effects and interrupts. It's simultaneously made my players more engaged and encouraged me to be more willing to improvise as a GM. When the players play a card and completely change the tide of a battle (or otherwise pull off an amazing feat) it doesn't feel like a gimmick or cheating, it feels heroic. Some of the best moments in our campaign were the result of these cards.

However, 20 dollars is an awful lot to pay for the adventure deck, and the action deck (aka normal playing cards), just isn't all that spectacular. The art on the facecards is cool, but not cool enough that I would buy it on its own. I would prefer it if they sold the action and adventure decks separately, but they don't. I would say fifteen dollars of the value is in the Adventure deck and five is in the action deck.",4.0
"Eminent Domain keenly combines multiple tried-and-true mechanics (deck building, resource generation, role choosing, etc.) into a very fun game with a cool theme.  As you take actions and lead/follow roles, you try to create the largest amount of influence.

I really appreciate the high-quality components; the little fiddly bits (wooden token and various warships and cards) are well produced.  Because the rules are succinct and clear, I felt comfortable playing this game even from my first play.  It also seems to scale well; I have a lot of fun playing the 2-player version.  As well, the game play and overall theme seamlessly meld together.

My biggest compliment to the game, I think, is that I haven't figured it out yet.  About 15 plays in now, I don't have a go-to strategy.  Some games, I go for military.  And sometimes, I think colonization is best.  And even a couple of times, my best strategy has been to research technologies.  Because it is different each time, I always feel challenged.

Kudos to Seth and TMG!  Great job!",4.0
"Eminent Domain is a deck building game that requires a strategy to win and some luck with your card draws. When you're playing against others, you need to decide the best way to inhabit your planets. Do you want to take them by force (Warfare) or by peace (Colonize)? I'll watch the other players before making my move because most players seem to take Colonize over Warfare. This leaves it wide open for me to get a lot of Warfare cards in my hand while others are going to fight over the Colonize pile.

Overall, it's a great game and it's fun from 2-4 players.",4.0
My son-in-law got it for Christmas and enjoys it.  He is a game enjoyed and said it was great. Now he needs time to play away from work.,4.0
"This is a card game that appears to take features from several other games. Specifically, Eminent Domain has mechanics from:

* Dominion - start with limited cards, add to your deck and re-use them on future turns.
* Glory to Rome - the ""leader"" chooses a role, and others follow that role, or gain a card instead.  The leadership then passes to the next player.
* Race for the Galaxy - gain planets and technology cards, which give special abilities and victory points.

If you have played and enjoy the above games, you'll like Eminent Domain.

If you have never heard of the above games, it will be a bit harder learning the flow of the game.  You might want to watch a video review of the game at boardgamegeek.com

"The Good - You have a fun strategy deck building game that has enough meat for interesting choices and a variety of strategies to try out. The interaction initially looks limited but in play, being able to benefit from another player's choice leads to a lot of back and forth during turns.

The iconography and design of the cards are well done. The tokens and ships are nice pieces of cardboard and chunky plastic. The central game mat is a pleasantly thick board and not flimsy paper. While the artwork for some cards might clock in as a bit cartoonish for some it highlights the theme well (having a light touch of humor with some).

The Bad - The game turn revolves around selecting role cards. As the exhaustion of role cards is an end game condition, your engine can take some time to build and only a few turns to utilize once it's in place before the game ends. I'd also say that card combinations not as deep as other games like Race for the Galaxy. While you have some interesting technologies to incorporate in your deck, the unique ones are somewhat limited. Players might also tend to slip into set strategies depending on the starting homeworlds they draw (which are limited).

Also, direct player interaction is not part of the game. It's all through a sort of proxy with the selection of role cards. While your opponent can take advantage of roles you select, you can't really do anything about it. Some looking for a 4X type of game where direct warfare against other players as an option will be disappointed.

Lastly, while the components are good overall I did have some dings in some of the cards and cardboard pieces from the player summaries and starting planets. Nothing huge, but certainly expect to sleeve those cards.

The Verdict - I enjoy Eminent Domain immensely. While it may have what initially seem as flaws with the game, through practice you realize they aren't really much as a major detraction. The initial feeling is one might find the game repetitive. However you realize much of your overall strategy depends on the first few initial planets you control which actually are quite varied.

Additionally, you really have to be fluid with your plans. If your 3 other opponents are going a heavy warfare route you are just adding to the ending the game faster jumping on the bandwagon (by exhausting the supply of warfare cards). It might be more prudent to shift into another strategic role that's less focused on by others. At the same time, you really want to be able to jump in on the action of other players' choices for roles. This all goes on under the backdrop of a deck building game, where you want to also try and keep a tightly refined deck of cards. Dabble into too many different things and you'll have a hard time getting the right cards you need.

This has sort of become my space empire card game choice as of late, replacing Race for the Galaxy. RftG is a fantastic game and one of my favorites. However the learning curve for RftG is so high, I just can't seem to justify getting it out to the table as much. Eminent Domain is much easier to teach, yet still has some surprising depth and a little more player interaction than RftG.

Eminent Domain is a good game that combines role selection with deck building elements. It's got enough player interaction and strategy to make for a fun game. And keeping the game to just about an hour means you can easily get a few games in a single evening. It's a great buy for an approachable, yet strategic, card game.",4.0
"So I went camping as kind of a chaperone with a youth group and learned to play this game at a picnic table.  The occasional breeze made so many stacks of card perilous, but it would have been too warm in the tent.  I was enthralled: surveying planets that would be subdued either by force of amassed fleets of fighters or more subtle attrition with one colony at a time.  I was producing and trading resources for points, and researching new technologies that- as I think of it- seldom improved the quality of life for my empire- some of the most expensive ones are game changes though all this from the comfort of a picnic bench.

Game Play

This is a role-based game similar to Puerto Rico.  Where one player chooses a role and does the action then others get to do it too, though not with the same bonus as the person who chose the role.  Its also a deck building game like Dominion only the number of cards to choose from is always the same and is much smaller.  This leads to how the role portion is different.  The more often you choose a role, the stronger you will likely be when you choose that role again in the future.

 My Canadian friends might at the point say, Eh?  (read: Please explain or huh?) Lets take surveying planets: before you can grow your empire youve got to find planets in the vastness of space.  The way its handled is you draw as many cards from the planet deck as one less than the number of survey cards in your hand.  Got three?  You draw 2 planets.  Look em over, consider and weigh them and then pick the won you want to show up in your empire.  Letss say you chose the role of survey, well you get to add a survey card to your hand, now you have four! You can pick and choose from more planets now, leading to better planet discoveries.  The poor guys who don't have at least two survey cards in their hand can abstain and draw a card from their deck to help them for the next role selection.

The roles are:

*Survey  Described above

*Colonize  One method of making a survey planet one of yours for points, trading opportunities, or other bonuses.

*Warfare  Second method surveyed planets become yours

*Produce/Trade  How you make or sell goods for points

*Research  Buy cards to add to your hand that help in role phase for either of two roles

Prior to choosing a role, you have an action phase.  This is when you can actually subdue planets.  Or use a research card to trash cards from your deck so they won't come up again.  Used in the action phase, the survey card will let you draw two new cards.

There are a few end conditions.  You run out of point tokens, or two piles of role cards are depleted.  There is a last up opportunity till you get back to the start player.  So everyone gets the same number of turns- even extra victory tokens (different color) that can be earned during those turns.

As I said, points can be earned by selling goods and by subduing planets, but also by possessing of some research cards.  Whoever has the most at the end wins.

 I hate to tell you what to do but

Multiple paths to victory is the name of the game.  Ive won going heavy on subduing planets, pushing an early game end producing and trading goods like crazy once I had four or five planets.

Something to watch out for when colonizing a planet, don't embark on one that you don't have enough colonize cards for.  These cards get tied up with the planet card and you need on in your hand during the action phase to finally flip the planet over.  If they are all tied up there, youll never be able to seal the deal.  (ok, you can buy a research card, and wait for it to be shuffled into the deck and finally be picked up.) or you could just watch out for that sort of thing.  The warfare method doesnt tie up cards- being a bit safer.

 Theme

Perhaps its apparent that I get caught up in the game.  The little fighters are awesome and sometimes get flown from where they were amassed to the planet they are subduing before they get returned to the supply because, by gum, Im in space!  Theres never any battle, just a threshold that needs to be met to subdue.  The planets are pretty the cards are gorgeous.  The resource chips, though variously colored to represent different resources aren't limiting if someone is hoarding them, but they are kind of plain.  I suppose you might take this out of space and then you are looking for islands to conquer instead?  Man-o-wars are probably more expensive to make than the little fighters.

 Balance

Most games have felt pretty close that Ive played.  You may look over at someones empire and see they have many more planets than you but hopefully you are thinking, yeah, but my stack of tokens from trade is a lot bigger than his while the third guy is smiling about the points from the technology cards.  If you are woeful, and you might be your first time, then if the shoe fits

 Interaction

This game encourages interaction.  Youve got to tell people what role you are doing so they can do it too.  But after that, my empire might as well be in a parallel universe.  I cant survey your planets.  I cant send my ships to your planet to steal your or destroy your goods, let alone take your planet and pleasantly trade with you.  That would be a fantastic expansion, says I.

 Learning Curve

Medium.  At least when Ive taught people the idea of tapping a card to affect the roll before or after it happens seems to be a sticking point, mostly because there are only two kinds of cards that go before a roll and you are used to tapping all the rest of the cards after you roll.  Once you get past that, then theres the analysis paralysis for those who struggle with the idea of multiple routes to victory.  Which of all those cards should I try to get?  Happily the opening options are limited.  The options increase as people warm up to the game- hopefully getting the hang of it.

 Downtime

Not much at all.  You are either getting a new card or doing a role.  Sometimes it takes a while for them to choose their action and unless they announce what role they are doing you could see them doing an action and jump the gun.  But

 Whats not to Like?

The prude in me strikes again: My permanent marker helped me a bit with the Artificial Intelligence card.  Really?  I grinning guy looking forward to time with a metal-clad winking female shaped robot?  Except the forced interaction previously described, its even more solitaire-like than Puerto Rico.  At least there you can shaft people by claiming a boat or two and cause them to throw their goods in the drink or buy the building you know the other guy needs or sell the good to the trader they have so they cant.  Yes, thats how I play that game.  I like to think of it as defensive playing.  Yeah, thats it.  But no room for that in this game.  I guess my mom should really like it.  I guess there could be a race for the really cool tech cards but thats pretty weak.

 Adaptations

Dont let the wee ones touch it- ok, theyve played with the fighters and the 1/8 thick planet cards.  Ive bought two copies of the game so that up to 8 can play.  And I think- for an expansion that you should be able to scout neighbors planets and trade with them and attack them.  Add a card called planetary defense that lets you beef up defenses on a planet.  If you trade with a surveyed planet you get two points and put the good on their planet and they can sell it.",4.0
"It's a little complicated to learn, but a good once through and a trial game later, you're going to want to come back to it and explore new strategies.",4.0
"""Eminent Domain"" manages to be something really unique- a deck-building game that focuses how cards are used to play in a very interesting way.  Players start out with a base deck, made up of five different kinds of cards and a wild card.  Decks of those same five base cards lay on a special tile.  Throughout the game, players may play one of their cards in hand for an action, but they must select another one of the five base cards for its ""role,"" essentially another action specific to each card, different from playing it as an action.  The player then takes the card from the tile and adds it to his discard.  Each player then may follow the role by also taking that action (though with penalties), or passing and drawing another card from their deck.

In some respects, the game feels very similar to ""Race for the Galaxy,"" but ""Eminent Domain"" is much simpler to learn and perhaps more fun to play.  Player's attempt to colonize words, or take them over via military conquest (small plastic spaceships act as military currency in the game), research technology (which gives players access to more kinds of cards), search for new worlds to bring into their empire, and produce or trade goods for victory points.  There is a lot going on here but not so much that you feel overwhelmed.  Also, with its 45 minute- 1 hour playing time the game will end before it starts feeling repetitive.  Like ""Race for the Galaxy,"" it does very much feel like each player is engaged in a solitaire game of building up their own unique star empire and trying to get the most points before anyone else.  With the ""roles,"" however, there is more player interaction.  What you choose to do on your turn will effect other players most of the time.  This helps to keep players engaged throughout.

Generally, I am very pleased with ""Eminent Domain"" and believe that fans of great deck-builders should definitively check it out.",4.0
"I've bought games on impulse in the past and been disappointed, so I waited to buy this game until after Rodney Smith showcased it on WatchItPlayed. I'm really glad I bought it - it's one of my favorite games ever. Every single decision you make, even down to how many cards you discard on a turn, has subtle long term effects on the rest of the game. Unlike other deck builders, you never have a turn where you can do nothing - you just might have an ineffficient term. The only reason I gave it a four is because the cards aren't as thick stock as I would prefer.",4.0

"Eminent Domain is a great Sci-Fi card game but lacks a bit of depth in the long run.  Cards are a bit on the thin side and the edges are black so you'll need to sleeve them for sure, but the artwork is great and easy to read.  The one thing about Eminent Domain that I didn't like was the lack of depth in the theme.  Honestly, after the first game, we didn't even think about it being a Sci-Fi game really.  Gameplay is sharp and very easy to pick up but lacks the depth of some of the other space opera card games.

All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase.  Eminent Domain is a great game that is quick and fun to play.  The lack of depth is overshadowed by the entertainment value of the game and the smiles-per-hour were very high.  Enjoy!",4.0
"I am basically a wargamer who enjoys other games that are civ building, economic competition or space exploration related.

I played the game with a gaming group I belong to, and found it interesting. I need to devle into the rules a little deeper, but I did enjoy the session. However, it was much more of a learning experience than a great gaming experience. If you wish to delve into deck building games, there are others I would recommend before this.

The components and artwork are OUTSTANDING. The rules are easy to follow.

I will not play this game a lot, as their are other games I wish to pursue, and I do intend to check out Race for the Galaxy. As for calling the game a ""toy"", it is not. I would not buy the game for a child under the age of 15. The rules say it is a game for 2-4 players. I think 3 is the minimum I would recommend. The information provided here gives some thoughtful insights to the game [...]

It is a game that requires a dedicated gaming group to get full enjoyment. I will continue to seek the 5-star space game. The closest I have come is Cosmic Encounters. I am considering Space 4X4 as the next foray into space.",4.0
"Eminent Domain is a game about building up a deck of cards that maximizes your potential to collect victory points before one of several game-ending conditions is met. It combines mechanics from recent euro-level board games (in-motion deck building and role determination specifically) to create a deep strategy game that doesn't reveal its true nature until your third or fourth run.

The game looks simple, and it is in an elemental sense: there are only five roles, the planets have relatively little variation, and you don't even have to pay attention to all the cards to play effectively. Curiously, this lack of breadth makes Eminent Domain much deeper than a game like Dominion because it allows you to exercise more precise control over your deck. I won't say it's more fun than Dominion, but luck is much less relevant in Eminent Domain.

If that sounds like your cup of tea, go for it; just keep in mind that you'll need a group willing to play this at least twice to appreciate how it works. Thankfully, the games are pretty short.",4.0
"I would rate this game 3.5 stars but no half allowed here. This is an ok deck building game. Its like Perto Rico and Dominion had a baby, in space! Haven't played with more than two so might be better with a larger group but as it is found it kind of limited in the strategy department. I found Core Worlds to be a better space themed deck building game.",4.0
"Yes, this is a good game. but its definitely not my favorite game.

Its got a great mechanic going for it, but i feel like lots of the cards you gain have problems with them.

For example, the only way to get planets for you to attack (a major part of the game) requires you to use survey. You use either warfare or colonize to take over the planets. In almost every case you will be flooding your deck if your using a strong taking over planets strategy. Soon you will find that your deck is more flooded with Surveys then your actual, original strategy of taking over as many planets as you can.

This is only one example of small problems i had with not being able to fully commit to my planned strategy. Yes its a good game but it suffers a tiny bit from losing your planned strategy becuase you forced to accept the weaknesses of each card and how they don't synergize with eachother.

LOVE the game more when adding house rules though, and theres alot of room for it.",4.0
"I have played this several times and already and enjoyed it. It is a fast game best with 3-6 people and because of the way in which cards are drawn has pretty much limitless replayability. It is more difficult for younger kids since they have less knowledge of people to match the cards, but otherwise works well for all ages, and there were some fun moments of debating if someone named really matched the categories on the cards.",4.0

"Buffalo: 2-8 Players, Ages 14+, Average Play Time = 20-30 Minutes

The manual is only one page long and the rules are laid out in a way that made learning the game easy to understand.  The cards themselves were on the bland side, but I honestly found them easier to read that way.  The box isn't as large as say, ""Apples to Apples"", making it ideal for travel and vacations.  The box could stand to be a tad taller, as the cards were spilling over across the insert.  In the grand scheme of things however, I had no complaints with the components or how everything was laid out.

I'll say this, ""Buffalo"" gave us a good mental workout.  It goes without saying that this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Despite being gamers, the boys and I have significantly different tastes in hobbies.  This goes double for the women of the household, as both Carolyn (14) and Jennifer often watch and listen to things that I can't stomach.  This game actually served to bring all of these different interests together, as we each were naming off people that some of us knew nothing about.  In a way, it was an educational look at the pop culture and world events that we each grew up with.

While the rules tasked us with laying these cards out on the table, we found ourselves just sitting around the dining room table and calling out word cards after our initial review session was over.  We'd pick two cards at random and just see if any of us could match them, without the step of keeping score.  This casual gameplay variant ended up being just as fun as the core game and I could personally see it being a great ice-breaker at parties.

Speaking of variants, the manual includes a ""repetition"" and a ""pro"" variant, giving players a different way to stretch their minds.  Repetition forbids players from using the same name twice, while the pro variant forces players to match all of the cards on the table to acquire visible buffalo cards.  The game is flexible enough to where you could come up with your own variants, for those of you who enjoy doing such things.  For example, folks could force players to match three or more cards instead of two or more cards.  This might make for a more difficult game, but you get the idea.

In the end, ""Buffalo"" doubles as both an excellent mind teaser and a superb party game.  While there is only one word descriptor per card, the chance that two cards would ever be dealt at the same time from one game to the next is pretty low.  Vinnie (12) had a difficult time with this particular game and this is a rare case where I'd recommend that parents pay attention to the 14+ age recommendation.  Both Jennifer and Carolyn (14) liked the game, but disliked the competitive tendencies that it could bring out in those who play strictly for points.

The price tag of $19.00, I feel, is just about on target.  Card games like ""Say Anything"", ""5 Second Rule"", and ""Last Word"" all go for around twenty bucks, give or take.  With that said, is ""Buffalo"" worth checking out?  Most definitely.  Is it right for you?  That depends.  Is your group overly competitive?  Do you have a lot of younger kids in your family that join you on family game night?  Do tempers flare easily where points are concerned?  If the answer is yes to any of those questions, then you may want to consider an alternative, more cooperative game.  Otherwise, ""Buffalo"" is just what the doctor ordered.",4.0
"This game is similar to Apples to Apples, though slightly more complicated, and is clearly designed to get one to empathize with potentially difficult situations (and plenty of funny ones). It is clearly targeted at a middle-school audience. I found the game fun, but many times the cards in my hand just didn't apply to the situation presented. Otherwise, it's a good game!",4.0
"This game was such a blast to play! It made you think about many realistic situations and how to handle them; which is turn, generated a lot of laughs. I would recommend this game for high school and middle school students.

However, as a college student, this game got to be a bit boring and a little repetitive. More cards would be great and maybe more adult-like situations would have made it more appealing to young adults.",4.0
"My students at school love this game! We had to prescreen some of the reactions and moments, but it caused some great laughs.",4.0
"We got this for our three middle school aged daughters.  It gives a nice balance of silly answers with an opportunity to discuss what we'd really do in these ""awkward moments"". While we got this as a family game, the kids have played amongst themselves and with friends too.",4.0
My students love to play this!,4.0
Clever!  You can't read the answers and not laugh out loud.  Definitely a keeper.,4.0
"I purchased the game outright based on the recommendation of a friend who shares my love of ""Betrayal at the House on the Hill.""  So, it was woefully dismaying to me that I needed to set aside A DAY OF PREP WORK in order to get everything assembled and ready for use.  As you can see in the other comments, the miniatures are NOT EASY to assemble.  They force a precision blade to extract them, a file in order to smooth down rough edges and plastic cement in order to join the pieces and then mount them to their bases.  IT IS CRITICAL that as you make your purchase, you either already have these elements on-hand - an Exacto Blade, a small file and Plastic Cement (I used Citadel's cement for Warhammer figures).  Even then, you will find no in-box assembly instructions and need to be careful in how you put together each piece since you might make it hard (or outright impossible) to put together the other elements.  Once the pieces are assembled, you'll then be forced to ""free-glue"" them to generic bases which further requires you to be extra careful during play lest they break-off.  Once I had finally completed all aspects of assembly (and the MULTIPLE store trips it required to do it), only then was I able to play the game with my daughters.  Once we finally got playing, we were having fun, but I must admit that my experience has been severely tainted by this terrible assembly process to the point where I am far less likely to acquire the complementary sets since I am not at all looking forward to suffering this ordeal again.",4.0
The game is great. The detail on thw minis is terrific contrary to what some say i thought it was fun to put them togather and paint.,4.0
"I hope you like assembling figures as this game is not playable straight from the box.  Also, after assembling the figures, you will have to find some storage space as they won't fit in the box.  The game itself is a blast.  Cooperative dungeon crawling board game with an old west feel.

I recommend getting the Swamps expansion box to expand upon the available monsters.  There are only 5 types of monsters in this box so replay gets a bit old with the same monsters.  Of course, having to buy 2 core sets is a bit much.

The game comes with an adventure book like Descent so that every time you play, the game will have some meaning.  Without the adventure book, the game can seem shallow.  Go in dungeon, kill monsters, and get the loot.",4.0
"While the rest of my gaming group is not the biggest fan of Shadows of Brimstone, I LOVE the theme. It's a great, immersive environment and I really wish I could play this more often.

The gameplay is great at first, but once you play for a while, you realize that there really isn't much choice involved if you want to succeed as a group. Everyone has their action ""choices"" but as a group the only way to win is to kill monsters, so if you're not doing that, you're not contributing to the group's success.

You get a LOT of components for the price, however, it is a bit on the expensive side.",4.0
"Shadows of Brimstone is a Western Horror Cthulhu-esque cooperative campaign game. If you have not played a cooperative campaign board game before, it means the players work together to complete objectives and achieve mission success while the board fights against them. Upon completion of a scenario, the characters retain their equipment and perks received throughout the mission and use them in future adventures. The game scales along with the characters progression, offering more challenging objectives and monsters along the way.

If you don't want a detailed review and just want to know my ultimate recommendation, skip to the end for a quick synopsis.

Component Quality and Setup:

This game cannot be played right out of the box! The rule manuals (yes, plural) are thick and require a generous degree of comprehension by at least one person prior to delving in. Due to the modular and random generation of the maps, it takes a modicum of practice to get the hang of tile placement and event ordering. Once the game gets rolling however, it becomes second nature and rapid fire tile placement occurs.

Even if you are a quick study, the miniatures  heroes and monsters alike  come in pieces and require a hefty amount of superglue assembly. I ended up using D&D miniatures for proxies until I had the time to construct everything. The pieces also do not come painted, yet adding another task for accurate and immersive representation. I imagine (and hope) the developer didn't intend to go cheap but rather wanted game owners to feel a sense of ownership in painting and constructing all their models. I personally don't have time for that. If you don't either and have boatloads of cash to spend, there are services out there that will sell you the game with all the pieces hand painted and assembled. Otherwise, set aside two to three hours prior to your first game to punch out tokens, read the rules, and glue minis together.

The quality of the map tiles, cards, and punch out cardboard are excellent. I transport my map tiles around in a small tote and they handle it without fraying. The plastic miniatures are terrible quality (I own countless board games and consider these among the worst), but once assembled if taken care of (not thrown back haphazardly into the box) they should last a while. Some of my figurines came bent or didn't snap out of the frame easily, and because the plastic is so thin and soft they were prone to damage. The booklets are spine-stapled and large so may come undone over heavy use, but otherwise everything else is great quality.

My advice is to have lots of small zip lock baggies on hand to help organize the counters, tokens, minis, and cards.

Gameplay:

Characters traverse over map tiles that (usually) unveil through exploration. When you enter a new map tile there is the chance of an encounter (a story scripted event that tests character attributes) or a battle. On more advanced gameplay, there may be residual effects in play from an encounter that impact the variables of a fight. All the while the darkness is growing stronger and you are desperately trying to keep it at bay while seeking the missions objective.

Combat and exploration are extremely satisfying for a number of reasons. Foremost, they are consistently challenging; the bad guys gain more potent abilities as the hero posse levels up, keeping them evolving along with character abilities. Loot is extremely frequent (found through scavenging or post-combat) and varied, offering unique enhancements or ability improvements. On top of that, there are numerous scenarios with different objectives and because the maps and fights are randomized even the same scenario can be dramatically different.

The games cooperative element is also top notch. Because of the impending darkness and ever-looming threat of losing your sanity or releasing the darkness, implementing strategy and collaborating on decisions is paramount. Conversation, socializing, and if its your groups thing even roleplaying is a fluid activity while the game progresses. SOB is more challenging, perhaps even impossible, if the posse doesnt work together to accomplish their mission.

A note about Expansions:

SOB consists of two base games and an increasingly large number of expansions. I have played City of the Ancients alone and I have played with all the expansions included, and I have some insight. First, when playing City of the Ancients or Swamps of Death alone you will cycle through the same enemies quickly. There are only a handful of varieties in the base games. I would recommend purchasing an enemy pack or two along with the base game to start off. The enemy packs will include a new enemy type with respective threat and combat cards. Sadly, the quality of minis are still garbage but the gameplay value increase is notable.

Second, adding a new world, such as Caverns of Cynder or one of the other base games, you will find that your game components proliferate exponentially. I found myself researching storage solutions that went beyond shoving everything into one or two boxes. Baggies, totes, and shelves are all dedicated to this game for me.

If you want new worlds to explore right away and storage isn't a concern then go nuts, as all the expansions add at least one new monster type and loads of added gameplay value.

Quick Synopsis:

The game itself is incredible. It packs the best elements of Tabletop RPGs and campaign-based board gaming into an innovative Cthulu horror-western. The feel of the genre persists throughout the entire game, including when you fight the final encounters and when you return to town only to find half of the villagers have mysteriously vanished. If you enjoy games where the player characters level up and take their hard earned experience and loot across scenarios then this game is for you.

SOB is ideally suited for a game group that has a core set of players that return on a regular basis for recurring game nights. Since the game and its expansions are expensive, I do not suggest it as an entry level or low budget choice. Barring that however, this game is amazing and if you have friends to play with and want a solid game choice for the next several game nights  don't hesitate to grab it. Gamers that have experience with more complex or challenging games, or like sensation of leveling up, will have the best of time shooting and slashing their way through the dark horrors that await them.

I gave 4 stars. Were it not for the quality of miniatures and setup tedium, the gameplay would easily drive this to a 5 star and beyond review. Were I reviewing this just as a player and not the owner/buyer of my game, I probably would have no complaints at all.",4.0
"I like most of the others here am Actually reviewing based off the PDF, but i plan on purchasing the hardcopy. I have played most of the big name RPGs on the block, D&D, HERO, GURPS, WoD. and have ran a few Sci-fi games using Hero, GURPS, and starwars d20. I also played in a few rifts games.

I enjoy science fiction literature but have always found that when it came to sci-fi i could develop decent stories but the rules systems were never very good. Rifts offers ridiculous imbalances, running terran empire with Hero is alright but i find for the most part Hero has a few balance and scaling issues at the low power scale. Starwars d20 was d20 which has it's place but 1) you are forced to do starwars pretty much and 2)d20 is not the most character based and flexable system.

So GURPS was alright and filled the need.

Now that i've seen Eclipse phase, for the style of sci-fi it presents, i don't think there is a better system out there. I find the universal systems will always do their job until a specifically tailored one is released which will do the job easier and hopefully better. Eclipse phase does the job better, while still leaving plenty of options.

If you want a crew of Aliens flying around the universe getting into space ship battles around far off moons, this might not be exactly the system you are looking for. There are some space opera elements but for the most part there didn't seem to be alot of focus on having a space ship flying around and blasting. Eclipse phase is sort of more of a Neo-Sci-fi. While still fantastical in some eliments (there are psionics). the vast majority of the setting seems to be a modern extrapolation of what technology could be, with some interesting elements add in to make the game interesting.

I like the default setting and the rules system alot and even though it isn't space opera focused I think a GM would be able to add in rules to make it more space battley pretty easy. They also leave you alot of leeway for playing around within their universe but not using their campaign per-say. There are things somewhat similar to 'stargates' so you could wormhole off somewhere crawling with aliens and play that way.",4.0
"I originally acquired the free pdf version of the game and enjoyed the setting and system so much that I ordered this handsome hardcover edition not too long afterwards.  Physically this book is very nice with my only gripe being the paper weight seems a little on the thin side.  The illustrations are very mood appropriate and the graphic design is very well done.  The setting is a very nice blend of transhumanism and horror and thoroughly detailed in this book.  My only real gripe was in the layout.  Things didn't seem to be organized in a way that was very intuitive (for me) and there was much page-flippage.  The upside is the index is very thorough and there are several page references within the body of text itself.  If you've enjoyed other sci-fi games like Transhuman Space, enjoyed the movie Blade Runner or loved the book Altered Carbon then this game is probably right up your alley.",4.0

"Eclipse phase is not the first attempt at doing a transhuman sci-fi rpg, but it's probably the most fully fleshed out and playable. There is a lot to like in this setting, with a wide level of intrigue and philosophy that can be digested in a gameable way.  Some tastes vary on the mechanics, a straightforward enough percentile system, but it plays as smoothly as any BRP game such as Call of Cthulhu. The character generation is a bit heavy however, working on a meticulous points-based scheme which I find a bit tiresome. The book itself is full color, hardback and bound in the manner of a book produced by a mainstream publisher.",4.0
"So this book was everything I wanted and more in terms of the info it provided and stunning artwork inside.  The only thing that dented my mood was the first time I opened the book it immediately caused a large indention between the pages, so much that when I closed the book you could clearly see the difference.  Now I worry about it falling apart at the seams since it seems to have started to.",4.0
"I have two copies of this book , both have very shoddy bindings, seems the books are very cheaply made.
The content of the book is good despite some things missing and other confusing aspects. For example there are no rules for the blast radius of most grenades. Overall this is a great game but it should be used with plenty of GM creativity and house rules.",4.0

"This is mostly a negotiation game based on the Starz original series (which I never saw) where players collect and spend money on slaves (income producers), gladiators (used for fights, another big part of the game), and other miscellaneous things like equipment for your gladiators and guards to protect you from attacks played by your opponents.

I like the mechanic they used to encourage a little extra negotiation among the players; during one of the phases players draw and play intrigue cards, many of which are used to attack your opponents such as steal money from them, injure their gladiators, or lower their honor level (this game's victory points).  You need to have a certain honor level to play these cards though and are able to combine your honor level with supporting houses.

The other big part of this game is the gladiator fights which in my one play so far are a little disappointing.  I like the idea, especially the way the hosting duties, invites, and deciding whether the loser lives or dies are handled.  But the fight itself is a Risk-style dice chain system where attack dice are matched against defense dice and are usually just decided by lucky rolls.

For the most part I like this game.  The mechanics used to encourage negotiation are good, the slaves and gladiators have different special powers which makes them interesting and the underlying mechanics of the gladiator arenas are actually interesting and well-designed as well.

I don't love it though, a big part of it being, as I said, the  dice combat system used for the gladiator fights.  The other reasons I didn't exactly enjoy my first game can easily be avoided though.  For one, despite what the game suggests, I don't recommend playing the ""quick game"" that has players start at 7 honor.  At that level most of the intrigue cards can already be played and all of them can be played with the support of just one house.  This makes it a lot less interesting when you can play every card out of the gate.  I recommend setting aside enough time to play the normal or even the ""long game"".

Also, and I know this would extend the game length as well, playing with 3 is a little uninteresting which I think is a poor number for any negotiation game.  Negotiation games are at there finest with more players so there is more wheeling and dealing.  With 3 it is easy to identify who is winning and the other two tend to gang up on that one player.  the base game supports 4 players and with the expansion you can accommodate 6.  I recommend at least the four even though this is looking like a 3-4 hour experience at that point.",4.0
"Really enjoyed my first play through of this game with 3 friends. Played a ""condensed"" version that lasted about 2 hours. Rulebook required a little bit of jumping around to verify rules here and there, but overall everyone had a great time! Looking forward to another game night where it will make an appearance.",4.0
"The fighting is a bit weak, but different than other combat systems. The game should be played with 4 people only. We had fun with 3, but 4 would be much better.",4.0
"For me, a truly fun game is balanced. Spartacus is not balanced.

Let me make a distinction, there's a difference between ""balanced"" and ""balanced learned curve"". I'm not referring to the latter when I say Spartacus is imbalanced. The learning curve is great on Spartacus. Good and less than good players are not equal. Good players do do better, and less than good players do have an obvious enough reward system to help them understand what would make them better.

What I mean when I say Spartacus is imbalanced is, however, that when you have a game where each character has unique native advantages and disadvantages, that uniqueness still should be roughly equal to the uniqueness of the characters with their native advantages and disadvantages. Using a simple wizard-game analogy, if I can shoot lightning for tons of damage, and you can shoot ice for less damage, your ice ought to have a secondary effect like chilling your enemies that boosts it. Back to Spartacus, certain characters (houses) are just better than other houses, and not just a little bit, but a lot better.

If you're playing a good balanced game, then when a player starts to win, other players will gang up on him/her. The problem with imbalanced characters is that this ganging up starts from the get go and is a necessary strategy in order to win. It makes the games (and the table talk) redundant.

However, in many other ways this game excels: you can strategize around your disadvantages, you can table talk your way to victory, etc. I would just suggest three house rules: (1) There's a 12-point victory point (influence) track. Start at four. This avoids that boring part of the game where one player has skyrocketed and losing is obvious and imminent for everyone else. It does this by enabling all characters to do more with the cards they draw so that if someone gets too advantaged too quickly, by making the advantage of the more advantaged characters less sizeable, and by eliminated a stretch of the victory point track. (2) Make it so that players cannot pool their money during the auction phase, including the host auction. This makes the game last a much more reasonable amount of time. And (3) allow players to rent out their weapons, armor, and special items during the arena phase, which allows weaker players to advantage each other through some rental agreement so that the skyrocketing player is not as super advantaged as s/he otherwise would be.

With these house rules in mind, I would buy the game. It's fun.",4.0

"My kids LOVE The Elf on the Shelf and have had them since 2008! We currently have 4 elves and 2 reindeer so of course when these came out we had to have them! I'm not sure why they are $25 when the reindeer were priced at $20. They're pricey but everything that is this brand is expensive.

While they are adorable, they aren't very well made considering the insane price that they are. It's almost impossible to get a discount on them at any store, this year Kohl's made it so that their coupons don't work on anything of this brand. Almost no point in shopping around since you'll pay $25 everywhere. So back to them being not very well made... I had ordered two of these from Amazon and noticed they had very crooked facial features. After noticing this I checked several of the local stores and found it almost impossible to find *perfect* or as close as possible dogs. I remember having this issue with the the reindeer when we bought them but this was much worse with the dogs as they have a plastic nose and fabric tongue. I know I sound like I'm being picky and stuck up but again, $25 for a very small stuffed animal and book is steep when it's not a quality made item. I haven't seen any issues with the elves, but the reindeer and dogs are hard to find with near perfect faces!",4.0

"Excellent game board for playing in an active environment. The small pegs at the corner of each square hold the letters quite well. The challenging thing for us was how to open the new box without tearing it---not fully realizing that we needed the box as storage when the game is not in use. Some folks find the plastic tiles to be too smooth, but once placed in the squares, all was good. The plastic tiles could be a choking hazard if small children get hold of them. In addition, including a score card pad would have been a nice touch. However, the main function of the board is fully realized, and we will be using this product for the foreseeable future.",4.0

"Not having read the details closer, I didn't realize this was a smaller version of the standard Scrabble game.
I find that I actually like this one though. It takes up less space on the table, yet the tiles and board are not so small that they are hard to read.

The board fits right in the box, about 12 inches square, so there is no need to fold and unfold the board.
The box fits perfectly in the cubby cupboards that are popular right now.
It is also small enough to take along on family vacations to help fill in the ""downtime.""
The tiles are of good quality plastic; the days of wooden tiles are on their way out, I fear.
The tiles are kept in place with little knobs at the corners on each square  on the board. It is actually quite an effective way to keep the tiles in place if the board gets bumped.

"Tile lock is actually really annoying unless you are playing in a car. It makes cleanup harder because the pieces stick to the board, so when you turn it upright to have them fall, they stay on and eventually can fall pretty far away from the board.

The tile rack made this one star less, it has a hook/tab kindda thing at the back and I was wondering if it hooks to the board to make it more stable in order for the tiles not to fall, but looks like it has anything to do with it but probably just a stand. It would have been nice if it does. So they may say you can play this at the car, train, boat or plane, but be prepared to hold on to your tile rack and tiles, because once the car does a sudden stop, your tiles could be flying out too.",4.0

The board is smaller than the regular game. The tiles smaller as well. But it works well. They aren't going to hang tight on to the board in the back seat of a minivan rolling down the interstate--the tile lock is not tight. But it would keep letters from flying everywhere when someone jostles the board.,4.0
"I think it is a good idea to have some sort of a device to lock the Scrabble tiles in place.  Winning Moves did it by placing small posts on every corner/intersection on the board.  It doesn't lock it in a way that you can invert the board and the tiles remain attached like a gecko on the ceiling, but you can tilt in an angle or slightly nudge the board sideways but never bump it from the bottom or the tiles will fly everywhere.  I think Scrabble boards should spin like Lazy Susan but that is not always possible unless you get the more expensive boards.  The Tile Lock Scrabble at least spin better with the tiles staying in place when someone else's turn.

This is a budget Scrabble set, you can tell by the price (around 15$ at the time of this review) that it is a basic set. Made mostly of plastics.  The board is about 25% smaller and doesn't fold.",4.0

Including the box, it weighs only a little more than a pound. Four small foam ""feet"" protect the surface of whatever you place the board upon.  Four tile trays, 100 letter tiles (same number as are included in Deluxe Scrabble) and a fabric tile pouch are included.

The size of the board is much smaller than all of the versions of Scrabble I have played over the years.  The smaller board, at 10"" x 10"", means smaller square tiles (which are each approximately the size of dimes).  This won't be a problem for me but I think my father (or anyone else with large hands or limited dexterity) might have some difficulty placing tiles in the right place on the board.

I was expecting a plastic grid to keep tiles in place, similar to Deluxe Scrabble but on a smaller scale.

"I am a Scrabble player, and have seen variations of Scrabble games for various transportable and convenient purposes.  What is nice about this is the compact size, and yes, smaller than a regular size board.  There are small beads that keep a tile secure as you place them for playing.  This makes it easy to work with even if your board gets tipped.

This is a nice portable size, great for the car, taking to someone's home, to the office, etc.  And, again, that is because of the size.

The only downside to this is there is no protection for the tiles on the plastic holders.  If you go through the trouble of placing beads to hold the tiles in place, what about the tile racks?  The tile racks could use some security, as for now, there is none.  And, basically, this means that if you are in the car playing with a friend, your board is secure, but your racks are not.

Other than that, this is nice and convenient for portability......Rizzo",4.0
It was everything I expected...flawless and effortless!,4.0
I would have gone one step further and have the tiles snap into place instead of just resting between the pegs. That would make little brother attacks less damaging :) The tiles are a bit more difficult to handle due to their reduced size but nothing terrible. The tile racks work well enough on a nice flat surface but will tilt over fairly easily on anything else.,4.0
its a little small and sometimes the tiles are a pain to set into the places. overall its not bad though.,4.0
"This is not a review of Scrabble, obviously. This is merely about how this board does what it claims.

The name is a little misleading. The tiles are not really locked in place. They're just held in place.

The way ""Tile Lock"" works is that the board has tiny plastic bits that protrudes out a little at the corner of each square. Each tile also have indentations in the corner. When placed into a square, each tile is held in place and can't be shifted out of position. You have to place the tile directly into the square, you can't slide them into position.

Once placed, the tiles are held quite well, but they are not locked in position. You can tilt the board beyond a 45 degree angle and they still won't fall out - you have to tilt it to a 70 degree angle or so, but if there is sufficient force (say, someone knocking into the table from below or if the car hits a particularly deep pothole) the tiles can still jump out of their squares.

The tile lock feature also makes it almost impossible to remove a tile if it is surrounded on all 4 sides by other tiles, without removing them first. This should not normally be an issue in Scrabble game play.

Overall, it works quite well. If someone accidentally bumps on the board or table, the tiles won't get shifted out of position. Have you or someone you know is one of those people who would constantly be adjusting the tiles during play so that they fit nicely and neatly in the squares, this board may be the answer to your prayers.

Keeping the tiles after game play is a little more effort - I find it easiest to tilt the board and empty it into the box, then scoop it out from the box to place back into the drawstring bag.

What I don't quite like is the size of the board. It's smaller than the ""normal"" Scrabble set, but not quite small enough to be convenient for travel. It's probably a compromise - the regular Scrabble board folds, this board does not. Game companies probably has research data on what is the biggest box size customers are willing to accept for a board game.

While it works well for its intended purpose, it would be nice if the quality of the plastic is better. Especially the trays - it would be nicer if they feel a bit more solid.

For the price and how well the feature works, I'm giving this 4 stars. I wouldn't recommend bringing it on a plane unless you don't have much else in your carry on luggage. Might work in a car if you're careful and you don't drop the board when passing it around. For travel, the travel edition with snap in tiles that actually lock in place will work better. They are smaller and more expensive though. It's all about compromise.",4.0
"It's been a while since I played Scrabble, but I do remember the frustration of trying to keep tiles in place!  I played this with my niece the other day and I was surprised at how small the tiles were.  I'm not sure how they compare to regular Scrabble pieces, but they seem TINY to me!  Other than that, the tile locks do exactly what they say and even my parents thought it was a pretty cool feature.  Great to have a new spin on an old classic!",4.0
"We like our Tile Lock Scrabble! This is our first adult version since purchasing the Junior Scrabble for kids. First off, we never owned the original deluxe version so I couldn't compare the two, but obviously you can pay more for that type of quality.

The plastic tiles are easy to use and like the compact size of the board. The whole box is lightweight for the convenience of travel. Although I would not recommend this for kids in a moving vehicle unless its an RV.

Overall, we have enjoyed this Tile Lock Scrabble because its fun to play and easy to use!",4.0
"This will be a down and dirty review.  First of all the board is very small.  It is for traveling and you can not really have a full size board when you are traveling around.  It is about 10 or so inches by 10 inches big.  This is small and the words on the board are small.  Second, the tiles to not lock per say, they fit very well and unless you hit a pothole the pieces should stay in.  Finally, the pieces are small, as in probably no more then 1/3 and inch by 1/3 and inch.

This is scrabble and it is a fun game.  Unless you are getting this for traveling then I would suggest a bigger game.",4.0

What I like about that game version is that it has raised squares on the board (in the form of a grid) that allows the tiles to be seated but not locked in place.

This&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tile-Lock-Scrabble/dp/1223063151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tile Lock Scrabble</a>&nbsp;board is not much different with regard to the ""locking"" feature except that there are 4 raised nibs at the corners of each square into which the tiles get placed.  The tiles DO NOT lock in place; they are just restricted from excessive movement.  Obviously, my other board is a little over double this size.  This board only measures 10 inches on all sides so it's closer to a travel or portable size. Besides the plastic board, a cloth bag holds all 100 tiles and four tile racks are included.

There are only two things I do not like about this particular version.  The biggest disappointment is that the rubber feet are not at the edges of the board. This means when the game is being played, the board can be easily tilted if someone leans on any one corner because the feet only support the center of the board. The second thing is that the game is mislabelled because the tiles DO NOT LOCK in place but they stay seated well (or are prevented from excessive movement) as long as the board is not tipped. These were the only two items that kept me from loving this version and rating this five stars.  Other than this, I really really like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tile-Lock-Scrabble/dp/1223063151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tile Lock Scrabble</a>.

"I play Scrabble on my tablet every day and on an old board about once a week. I've owned the old deluxe board and a travel set, both of which had indents to hold the tiles in place.

The tiles feel good. They are very easy to read. Of course they are smaller than a full sized tile, but the font takes up more space. I thought they would feel too small, but they don't. They have a good heft, feel good in the hand, fit in the tile racks well, and sit between the pegs perfectly. I am impressed with the way they fit. It's quite satisfying as the game board fills up as the tiles sit up against one another nicely and do not shift. I did not find them hard to maneuver nor did my playing partner.

It's really not the best design for travel. It doesn't fold in half like the old travel set, so one would have to bring the entire box. The board's surface feels a bit too flimsy to throw into a bag without the box so it doesn't really take up that much less room than a full sized set. However, it one is going to play on a boat, or at the beach, this would be a good set. But, I am unsure whether the board would stand up to getting wet. In fact, I doubt it. So, it wasn't thought out fully.

My other issue are the colors of the board and pegs. There's simply too much red. The pegs are bright red and the double word squares are the same brights red (as opposed to the pink on a regular board). On top of that, there are double red lines where the white lines between the squares are; all that red is quite distracting until one is almost done with the game and it's all covered up. I suppose one would get used to it, but I really found it unappealing.

The triple letter score squares are green instead of dark blue and the double letter score squares are dark blue. If you've been playing with an old board for a long time, you'll be finding yourself checking the squares, which is pretty disorienting if you've been playing for some time!

Still, it's a great idea. The tiles are not truly ""locked in"" but it's close. My old deluxe set melted in the heat outside on a hot day and I found the old travel set's tiles way too small. If this set were full size, could fold in half, and the colors were the same as a standard board, I'd give it five stars plus.

Yesterday, after playing a game on my bed (very relaxing), I gave this set three stars, neither great nor bad. But today when my husband and I played yet another game, both of us surprised ourselves by deciding to play with this set yet again. So, four stars. It's really fun lazing in bed while playing Scrabble. Big plus: it's quite hard for our cat to bat the tiles around. She only managed to dislodge one tile!",4.0
"I loved the concept of this newest scrabble version.  The tile game board is great and keeps your game from getting messed up if you accidentally push the board around.  My only comment is that I wished the tiles actually locked in, as the name suggests,  really the game board just sets the tile in place, it doesn't actually ""lock"" in.  I was hoping that the tiles would snap in place but besides that the board is more secure than previous versions.",4.0
"This is a nice Scrabble set overall, but it's not a luxury version.  The board is lightweight plastic and measures about 11 x 11 inches.  Each tile has four little plastic pegs that hold the tiles in place and keep them from sliding around.  The pieces are plastic and come in a little bag.

I would say the main market for this product lies with people who want it for traveling or transporting.  It would be great to use in an RV, where you want a board that is small and easy to store, but which also can keep the tiles from sliding around.  It would also be a good version for kids owing to the low price and relatively simple design.  If you are looking for a luxury set, you better keep looking.

Overall, though, this product comes as advertised and is a nice addition to my collection of Scrabble boards.",4.0
"I think the name of this product is very misleading. In no way do the tiles actually lock into place. Instead there are 4 little pegs that stand up at the edges of each spot on the (plastic) board that are supposed to help keep the tile in place.

The pegs do achieve this if you tilt the board a little bit or if you just want to slide it do someone else can view it easier (not read upside down). They do not achieve any kind of helpfulness if the board is knocked against or bumped roughly. The tiles will go spilling.

All parts of this game are plastic - which with kids is kind of nice - I can wash them!  But I do kind of miss those wooden letters - but maybe I'm just old school.

The board itself is smaller than a normal board - it measures 10"" x 10"".  There are 100 letter tiles, 4 plastic tile racks, and tile bag included with game board.

Overall my kids and I enjoy both using this board for education purposes (they spell their spelling words on it) and for an actual fun game of scrabble.  I just wish the tiles actually locked into place. Seems like a simple adjustment to the design could have achieved this.",4.0
"Nice Scrabble game for the $$$.

Pros:
  Quality hard plastic tile, nice size letters and game board,
  Little pegs to hold tiles in place (awesome feature, )

In Between:
  Game board is smaller than a lot of other Scrabble boards.  This can be a pro or con depending on what you want.  If you are playing on a smaller table this is great,  larger tables will make it more difficult to see the letters and players will have to reach further.

Cons:

"We really like this game because of the locking tiles!  We have young kids, and so it is great that if the board gets bumped the tiles don't go everywhere.  The only thing that we don't like about it is that the board is pretty small.  If it was a little bigger that would be nice!",4.0
"smaller than what I though, but still useful. glad we bought it and it arrived very quickly. thanks for the quick ship",4.0

"In retrospect, I would prefer to have a traditional Scrabble board as this one is more of a pain to put and keep the tiles in their place than is worth the trouble. However, for the purpose it was created, I'd say it's a good product if you were to have it in your RV on a smooth drive.",4.0

I bought this game for my boyfriend and his son for Christmas and they really like it. I liked the tile locks which is really handy when playing with kids.,4.0
The tile lock feature is really helpful as we like to spin the board around when we play.  The board however is so small it gets frustrating.,4.0
We love Scrabble and the tile locking board is great. The letter rails are too light and fall over easily. We actually started using our old wooden tile rails instead. They work better.,4.0

They love it! my seven-year-old is better at this game, he can play with his friends and my five year-old is learning how to do her 'sight-words' from school.
Great price for a game I loved as a kid and wanted to share with my kids.",4.0
"I purchased this as a gift. The tiles lock in place, so they would slide out of place. Fun game. The gift was a hit.",4.0
"It is a nice game, was shipped in a timely fashion. Would recommend it to others.  Not much more today here",4.0
"The board is smaller than I expected, but everything about the pieces is cute! The red letter ""benches"" are better looking than the typical wooden design. The drawstring bag is nice, and the board, made of plastic, would last longer than cardboard boards of an older Scrabble board I had years ago. I spent two hours playing this with my sister and niece. It's a good game to have for a rainy day. I just wish the pieces weren't so small.",4.0
The product was exactly as discribed and pictured. Arrived quickly and has been an exellent addition to our game collection.,4.0
"Tiles can fall off of this game's board easily because each play-square is surrounded only by tiny small pegs in each corner.

I've seen that other ""tight-fit"" Scrabble boards have a complete embankments surrounding each play-square.  This structure give the tiles a stronger perimeter and makes them less likely to come loose.",4.0

love it ... play all time
and its make use the dictionary allot :)",4.0
"Good quality and fun. Pieces are smaller than the original, but still very usable and good for smaller places like traveling.",4.0
"I purchased this version because I needed a board that would hold the tiles. This helps with organizing the tiles, knowing exactly square they are on, also it helps with accidental bumps to the board. The board uses pegs and there are notches in the tiles to keep them on the board.",4.0
"This Scrabble game is advertised as a ""lock"" Scrabble game. Actually, the tiles do NOT lock. The tiles are placed so that they don't move around while you're playing, but if the game is jostled, the tiles could be in disarray. So the tiles do NOT lock. All the same, it's a little different, and as a Scrabble playing enthusiast, I am enjoying using this set.",4.0

"If your daughter spends all her money on tchotkes at the Scholastic Book Fair, then she will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this journal.  My 7 year old made an absolute mess of the puff paint frosting, but a more focused or mature child/teen could really make it happen.  Of course, my 7 year old plopped down the stickers and then puff painted around them instead of pressing the stickers into the puff paint.  Following directions would be helpful to get the look on the cover of the journal.  But the beauty is that my 7 year old could have cared less because SHE made it and then SHE wrote in it.  The page prompts are fun, but the highlight is definitely in the decorating at the beginning.",4.0
"This is very cute! Definitely geared towards older girls as it's more of an activity book than a journal. There's a lot of surveys and questionnaires and artsy activities for them to do, more of a fill in diary. The decorating is a lot of fun but it's messy and takes a long time to dry. My daughter's favorite part were the charms. It definitely keeps them entertained and it's a fun keepsake for them when they get older!",4.0
"My granddaughter loves this kit. It was hours of fun for her. Before I get into details the only CON I have for this diary is that it takes too long for the clay frosting to dry. The instructions says it takes 24-48 hours to dry (48 before it gets hard). I think this is entirely too long. And even after 48 hours the frosting is not completely hard. It is spongy. Another tip: Don't put the frosting on until the very end. My granddaughter put it on first and it made it difficult to open the pages without getting the frosting (puffy paste) everywhere.

If you're looking for instructions, they are on the inside of the diary and have perforated pages that can be torn out. The diary comes with the puffy paste, 5 custom charms, 4 sheets of squishy stickers, 15 rhinestones and a star tip. The pages have a place where your child can answer questions about herself, like an about me section, a rainbow quiz with questions (If I could be an animal, I'd be a?) and other fun pages. It has a 30 days of Happy where the child writes down something that makes them happy for 30 days in a row.

The product page says this is recommended for ages 8+, while the inside of the diary says 3+ and up. I would not recommend this for a 3 year old. However, even though the description says 8+, my granddaughter is 7 and very responsible. I would even say someone 5 or 6 could do complete this journal with the help of an adult. My 7 year old did it by herself, she just needed a little assistance with the frosting and the tip.",4.0
It's okay the glue gets messy,4.0
"My 11 year old loved this. She is into crafts big time and she also likes to keep a diary. When she saw this, she got very excited and couldn't wait to get started on it. She had a blast decorating it and loved the fake frosting.",4.0

"Love all the colorful pictures and monkey faces are fun for the kids to touch. Each page has the monkeys doing something different, something you can use for learning. ""That Monkey has a cookie, oh oh that money hurt his foot, etc.""
Very cute and a book you can 'sing' which makes it a bit different.",4.0
My daughter is 10 mo old and loves this book. She likes to poke her fingers through the holes and also likes the sing-songy rythem of the book. I am happy with the purchase. We also bought 10 little ladybugs and she loves that one too.,4.0
"No mess drawing, however there is no creative page for the kids and they colored in the book fairly quickly",4.0

"On a whim, I got a few friends to get together and play this game through.

I, frankly, will soon be adding this gem to my game collection! While there is currently an absence of Magic: the Gathering players, you can play this with a few buddies. And there aren't $300 cards to add on, either. I recently finished up a 5 hour game with three buddies, and the satirical humor was the only thing keeping us up other than the sheer manipulation, deceit, and crazy power struggles it evolved into. I found myself performing twists and turns that I could never imagine myself doing in any strategy game.

This is a game about conquest, plain and simple. Manipultions, wheeling and dealing, and all of that come attached. By amassing a horde of money to stock your Illuminati faction's treasury, and by building a structure of carefully organized power, you must aim to accomplish one of two goals: gain control of groups in proportion to the number of people playing, or complete your faction's ""secret goal""; be it summoning Cuthulu to destroy the Earth, amass the world's greatest treasury, build the biggest power base, etc.

I will tell you right now that this game is not ""nice and friendly"", and there are some imbalances. I feel that the imbalances were meant to be there, in order to force the other players to wield strange politics, and work together to keep each other from getting too powerful - while chasing their own goals at the same time! It gets very crazy, and can keep you up until 3AM playing.

My only slight beef is that the instructions were written a bit obscure, in like, two places. However, through game play, we did sort out misunderstandings. There were no errors or inconsistencies... they even have rules on ""cheating"", written in a rather sardonic and humorous fashion. :)

I also like the blurbs on Illuminati trivia and history, about the Gnomes of Zurich, the Society of Illuminated Seers from Bavaria (or something), and others. A bibliography has also been included for additional Illuminati referencing and amusement.

I would love to write some more, but alas, it is 3:45 AM, and my forehead is about to bang into my keyboard. :)",4.0
"This is one of the classic games from Steve Jackson's company that can be found being played at most any gaming convention. Friends of mine once even reprinted the game onto aluminum cards to increase the ambiance and look of the game, it's that popular.
The update includes new art for all of the cards and the addition of many groups from the CCG version I:NWO. There is an expansion to follow soon with even more cards.
For those of you new to the game, the setting is thus: You are one of the mysterious 'illuminantis' who wish to rule the world. You have a goal all your own in addition to the generic 'take over the world' goal as well. For example, the Discordians wish to control five 'wierd' groups. To this end each of the players struggles to control any of the hundred or so groups that are available to take over. Everything from the 'Boy Sprouts' to 'Empty Vee' and 'Moral Minority' are in there to use as puppets.
Take over the world if you can... ""The UFO's, with assistance from Texas will attack to destroy the Congressional Wives...""",4.0

"This is a really fun game, if you take the time to go through the ""ifs"" and ""maybes"" of the instructions. Its simple as a draw one, play one. A battle here and there. And thats it. Once the people in your group figure out who you are and what you are doing to try to win the game, then the game becomes interesting. Take the time to play it once or twice, then get some people who want to play a fun card game for an hour or so. Its worth it.",4.0

"Good expansion to the Illuminati Deluxe game, lots of new groups and it introduces Artifact cards into the game, works good in addition to the Y2K expansion.

This item is still available from the publisher for around twenty bucks, not sure why Amazon does not sell it, it is not worth hundreds of dollars.

Look up Steve Jackson Games Illuminati web page

[...]",4.0
"It delivers as advertised.  The new groups are a blast, and the addition of artifacts add a great dynamic to the game.  If you are an Illuminati fan this will keep it fresh.

I wish there were some more Illuminati organizations but this is easily overlooked with all the other groups and artifacts.",4.0
"Takes a while to understand the complicated 16 page rule book, but can be done.  Only problem is finding 2 to 6 other players willing to play!
Bit disappointing that it's watered down from the original 1995 edition, by omitting the twin towers (terrorist attack) and Centers for disease control, etc.  Obviously an Illuminati conspiracy to re write history! Ha ha ha.",4.0
"I've played both the new and the old versions of Illuminati, and I can say that this version is an improvement over the old one.  My main problem with the game, though, is that, when I've played, it devolves into long sessions of slap-around-the-leader. ( I'd use stronger language, but this is an Amazon review. )

Every time one player gets near winning, all the other players procede to, more or less, destroy his power structure and his chance at winning.  While a strong Illumanati will fend off two or three attacks, after eight or nine, you just don't have anything left to resist with.  So, you're back to nearly square one and, while you're trying to rebuild, you're helping everyone else do the same thing to whomever else might be nearing the win.  Games can last three or four hours until someone manages to squeak out a victory.

Now, if you like that kind of game, that's fine, but that gets a little long for me.

Also, and this is another minor issue, I have never seen any player manage to win by the standard victory conditions.  For those who've never played, a standard victory is controlling a certain number of groups, with the number depending on the number of players.  For a five player game, for example, I think it's somewhere around a dozen groups.

Each Illuminati, though, also has its own victory condition:  The Gnomes of Zurich need to collect a certain amount of money, The Assassins need a certain number of Violent groups, The Discordian Society need a certain number of Weird groups, and so on.

Since I've never seen a standard victory, everything can depend on the right groups becoming available for each group.  If you're the Discordians, and no Weird groups come up, you've got no chance at winning, in my experience.

Don't let me discourage you from buying this game, I'm not trying to.  I am saying, though, that it can be so irritating that you'll throw it on the shelf and never look at it again.",4.0
"I thought this game was fun and interesting.  The rules take a bit to get down, but they are thorough, so you don't have to interpret them.",4.0
"By now, Munchkin has become something of an icon in the non-electronic gaming world. The game play is relatively straightforward: (1) collect cards that give you points, (2) flip over cards that depict monsters, (3) compare your points to the ""level"" of the monster, (4) defeat the monster or attempt to escape (depending on the results of your points comparison).

Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play, so each card contains (often substantial) text.

The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate, but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best. If you stick to those numbers, a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.

This set CANNOT be played as a standalone game but is rather a (fantasy themed) expansion to the original Munchkin core set (although it is also compatible with any of the many Munchkin sets and expansions).

Overall, the play is very fun, portable, fast-paced, and often amusing.

This expansion adds a number of amusing cards to incorporate additional variations and twists on the game, and does a great job of breathing new life into a wonderful game. The addition of Dungeons-- a ""global"" card that effects all the characters and monsters in the game at the same time -- is one the more entertaining new features added thus far.

Note that this particular expansion set, like its core game counterpart, is fantasy themed -- in other words, if the player doesn't enjoy (or won't understand) Dungeons and Dragons and Lord of the Rings jokes, you are better off getting a different set of Munchkin cards (Star Munchkin for sci-fi fans, Zombie Munchkin for zombie fans, etc).

"This is a great addition to the standard Munchkin game. You get several new cards and a new way to play. There are new cards called ""dungeons"" as the box indicates. Everyone start the game in one, and you can leave and enter new ones (or multiple) throughout the game.

The dungeons can span from ""if a curse is played or drawn it applies to everyone"" all the way to crazy ideas like ""everyone changes sex and picks the opposite sex version of their name. You must call them by that name or lose a level.""

This deck is a great expansion, personally I think it's the best, and a must have to any avid Munchkins player. The cards come with the Munchkins humor and great, colorful pictures.

I do recommend that you do not use the dungeon cards if you are lacking in time because they can make the game A LOT longer.",4.0

However, please be aware of the age range. It says 8+, and looking through it I doubt many children younger than that age are going to get much out of it. If nothing else, this book assumes they can already read well enough to understand the instructions with little to no help.",4.0

My only issue is the square corners of the cards, granted they are replicas but it makes shuffling a challenge.  I would love to see more of these decks, with round corners and more affordable, they don't need to be ""replicas"", I just like the old world look and the lack of numbers in the corners, it's fun to play with them.",4.0

"I run a Weird West RPG with a card-based mechanic and I'm always on the look-out for atmospheric card decks to dress-up the game and give the players a little value added enjoyment.

With these I reckon I've hit some sort of sweet spot. The pip printing looks like it was done on a low-budget press (but wasn't), the court cards have a one-way up, crowded artwork feel. None of the cards has an index in the corner, and those corners are square rather than rounded. The backs are also very olde-worlde in look. 10/10.

I'm dropping a star because there are no jokers in the deck, and I need them. There are a couple of cards with a printed history of the deck on them and I'll write ""joker"" on them, but it won't be the same.",4.0
"I really like this deck, got it for atmosphere/effect for an RPG [Deadlands Hexslingin'] - note that even though there are 55 cards in the deck, there are no Joker cards. Of the extra 3 cards, one is an original-styled Ace of Spades [kind of bluish ink with an eagle and stars], and the last two are a fairly interesting history account of L.I.

"Snatch, by U.S. Games Systems, is a simple word game which is compact, quick to learn and fun!  The game comes with 100 plastic tiles, and it is cleverly packaged in a simple tube (it sort of looks like a small, plastic packing tube).

Play is simple.  Players lay all of the tiles face-down in the middle of the table.  Then players take turns flipping the tiles over one at a time.  When a player sees a word three letters or longer, they shout it out and snatch it from the center, setting it in front of them.  Players can steal each other's words by adding a letter to them, so beware!

What's great about this game is that unlike many word games (Scrabble, for example), it's socially interactive the whole way through.  No waiting for other players to take forever making their play.... it's fast-paced and fun.",4.0
Thanks,4.0
Awesome card game.,4.0
"For some reason, in my set the pieces looked like they were broken or manufactured incorrectly. On my friend's set, the glass covered both sides of the letter tiles. But in my set, the glass only covers one side and you have to always stick the blue squares back into the glass casings. Very annoying, since they keep falling out every time.",4.0
This game is a fun variation on scrabble.  It's great for younger players since the words don't have to be very long and you are not limited to the set arrangement of a scrabble baord.,4.0
"Easy to learn, fast play, and compact -- play on any flat table. Probably best with 3 or more players but fine with 2. Basically uses the exact same part of your mind as scrabble but has is faster, more intense and also more complex.

The tiles are acceptable but they could be a little nicer. And it would be nice if they gave you a bag for the tiles -- the tube is fairly easy to carry around but a small bag would make this game even easier to bring along on trips.

Lots of fun and well worth having in the house.",4.0

It is similar to a game we've played using regular cards, but the addition of wizards and jesters adds to the enjoyment for youngsters and does add a twist to the game.  The rules are fairly simple.  A lot of the game is the luck of the cards received, but there is some strategy involved and requires some concentration.

I would play it without the wizards, or with only one or two, or maybe change the rules so that the wizard becomes the highest or lowest trump, and it's subject to the trump rules...  I just don't like being able to play the wizard at anytime, even if you have the original suit played.",4.0

Heres the cliffs notes version Non-PC;

I read the rulebook to fall asleep when I can't get to sleep. Whoever was the master sculptor likes to splitting tiny pieces into smaller halfs that could've been casted whole so you get stuck glueing microscopic pieces together. Not only that but pieces don't fit snugly together for a test fit prior to gluing, instead you have to roll the dice. Some pieces don't even fit together at all, instead you have to lay them on top of each other with some glue. The assembly instructions appear to be made by someone who had no idea what was going on and who had SOME pieces to go on and a bootleg copy of illustrator. This game should only sell for $40 tops in my opinion due to the quality of plastic and the above said. The price here however although seriously pushing it is better than than the $100 I paid at the shop (had I known...).

Four stars because it's Robotech, the rules are pretty straight forward if you pace the reading, I'm ok with intricate or detailed work, the box the starter comes with is very nice and sturdy. Can't wait to start playing, just the Battloids, Destroids, and Zentradi forces to go..... after a month.....",4.0
"as a backer, I've had this for about a month now. Overall, it's a good product. It definitely has some flaws but if you are willing to stick with it, it can be fun to recreate battles from the show.

Pros:
- Models look pretty good when assembled and especially when painted
- Rules are fairly clear and fast (faster than 40k, not as quick as X-Wing)
- Lots of models included
- Robotech!

Cons:
- As stated in other reviews, models have a large piece count. Some models (Galuag and Recon pod especially) have fiddly bits that are hard to get off the sprues without breaking. Just about every piece is split down the middle, so you have to be careful to not have seams and in some cases you have to fill seams even if you assemble them firmly.
- Some ambiguity in some rules. Mostly this is about the Close Formation rules
-  if this the first buyer for table tops stops and get help
- Assembly instructions are bad.
-The product does have a few flaws, as any first edition game does. This is to be expected.
-While not a perfect product the game is fun. There are a great many models to assemble (and paint if you choose), so the investment in time in order to play is fairly high.

I would recommend this game,if have experiences,time or money it WILL TAKE  TIME  to built THIS
Hopefully Palladium Books will improve on this for later editions but as a start, it's a good product.",4.0
"This is an in-depth review of the product ""Robotech RPG Tactics Starter Board Game.""

1) OPENING THE BOX

The first thing you'll notice about Robotech: RPG Tactics is the sheer size of the box: it's over 11 inches long, 11 inches wide, and 6 inches tall, so it takes up a lot more space than an average Parker Brothers or Fantasy Flight Games box.  When you open the lid, you'll see that it's covered in gorgeous artwork depicting battles between the United Earth Defense Force and the Zentraedi Armada.

Then you'll look inside the box, and you'll notice how much stuff is inside.  There's over 20 plastic sprues, which will allow you to assemble 5 Veritech Fighters, 5 Guardians, 6 Battloids (1 extra, I guess in case you screw up), 2 Tomahawks, 2 Defenders, 12 Battlepods, 1 Glaug, 1 Quel-Regult, and 1 Quel-Gulnau, which I didn't recognize from the series but is apparently a Zentraedi ""Recovery Pod.""  There's also over 50 stat cards (they are sort of laminated, but I wouldn't risk writing directly on them), 24 Robotech-themed 6-sided dice (12 UEDF, 12 Zentraedi), 20 infuriatingly small command tokens, a blue artiller template, 2 decal sheets that will give you flashbacks to your childhood, and 1 decent-sized, full-color rulebook.  There's almost TOO MUCH stuff.

Unlike Warhammer 40,000 or Warmachine's ""starter board games"", there's enough in this box that you'd never need to buy anything else (I'm sure you'd need two or three boxes if you wanted to play in a Robotech RPG Tactics tournament, but as I mention below, this isn't really a ""tournament"" game).  Of course, there's a flyer in the box that advertises all of the cool stuff you COULD buy - it seems there are plans to release some of the more obscure Macross saga mecha, followed by the Masters Saga and New Generations machines at some future point - but the rulebook is full of plenty of scenarios you can play using just this box set.  You're also not going to want to buy anything else after getting this box, at least for a little while.  This thing takes forever to put together.

2) PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER

Let's not beat around the bush: the average number of pieces you'll need to assemble one if these playing pieces is TWENTY.  ""Big deal"", you say, ""I can put together Space Marines in my sleep.""  Not so fast, these are much more similar to Japanese Gundam models than typical gaming miniatures.  You're going to be using an X-acto blade to cut these brittle plastic pieces (think the material used to make Lego bricks, but thinner) from their sprues, filing down seams, filling in gaps, and praying to God you don't glue your fingers together.  Getting this game ready to play will take more than a couple hours.  We're talking at least a holiday weekend... longer if you plan on doing the kinds of customization that will make this product look truly exceptional.

If you consider yourself an ""expert"" at assembling tiny plastic model kits, this product will challenge you to create some of the most beautiful figurines you can imagine.  Give yourself three hours to cut and reposition limbs, and you'll be able to recreate any pose the Valkyries take in the show.  If you have a pin vise and a can of GluBoost sitting in front of you right now, and you love Robotech, then go ahead and add this product to your shopping cart, because Robotech RPG Tactics is your playground.

However, if you consider yourself a ""beginner"" or even ""intermediate"" hobbyist, then these models are going to frustrate you.  Whoever designed this product made several legitimately horrible design choices: they gave the models amazing potential at the expense of accessibility.  In fact, if you've never used model clippers and superglue to put together a model kit, I would suggest you stay far, far away from Robotech RPG Tactics, because you'll end up with a bad impression of the hobby.

3) PLAYING THE GAME

After playing the story-based missions from the rulebook, I think this game does a great job simulating the ""feeling"" of Robotech/Macross.  The Valkyries dart around the battlefield, switching forms in response to the flow of battle.  You'll immediately notice how different a Valkyrie operates in each of its three modes, and each mode offers its own distinct advantages and disadvantages (it's not quite so simple as ""fighters can move the greatest distance""; they actually HAVE to maintain forward thrust every turn, they follow strict turning requirements, etc.).  Regults play like expendable footsoldiers - they have a rule called ""life is cheap"", and Khyron can gain temporary bonuses by killing his own men - while Glaugs provide their squads with an increased range of command options.  There are special things Valkyries can do when they are ""in formation"", but they can also split up and try to flank the enemy forces.  On any given turn, Rick will fire missiles at a squadron of Regults, the Regults will try to shoot them down, the surviving Regults will shoot back at Rick... and then you can choose whether Rick dodges, attempts to ""roll with it"", or Ben dives in front of Rick and takes a bullet for him.  Each turn, both players are given a set number of ""command points"", which can be used to accomplish feats of improbable heroism or villainy.

Overall, the rules provide an extremely cinematic game experience.  At times, you'll feel like you lost because your opponent outplayed you; at other times, you'll feel like you only won because of dumb luck.  You'll rarely feel like the rules are unfair; however, you'll often feel like the rules are fun at the expense of clarity.  For instance, in tournament miniature wargames such as Warmachine, the rules clearly delineate when you can measure the distance between two models, and when you can't.  In Robotech RPG Tactics, you're allowed to measure whenever you want, but the rulebook gives a friendly reminder that, sometimes, frequent measuring and re-measuring can bog down the game's pace.  Although this kind of thing didn't seem like a serious problem to me or anyone I played Robotech RPG Tactics with, I know from past experiences that many miniatures wargamers, especially those who like to play in tournaments, want rulebooks to be as specific as possible.  For those kinds of wargamers, Robotech RPG Tactics may seem unpolished.

4) FINAL THOUGHTS

Robotech RPG Tactics was produced by the role-playing game company Palladium (famous for games like ""Rifts"", which emphasize tone over mechanics) and the young-and-hungry miniatures designers Ninja Division (famous for producing a number of anime-themed, ""you either love it or you hate it"" games such as ""Relic Knights"" and ""Tentacle Bento"").  Perhaps this is why the components Ninja Division produced - the miniatures - are best enjoyed by experienced hobbyists looking for a challenge, while the components Palladium produced - the rulebook, the stat cards, etc. - are best enjoyed by Robotech fans who have been waiting years to play a Robotech board game, but may not have much experience with Robotech RPG Tactics' competitors such as Battletech or Heavy Gear.  I think that if you are interested in Robotech or robot model kits enough to consider buying this product, you should go for it.  Even if there are parts of Robotech RPG Tactics you feel could have been done better, you'll feel like you got enough Robotech merchandise to justify the price tag.",4.0
"Note, this game requires a lot of work before you can play it. You will spend hours putting together the miniatures. More on that later.

While I have not had a chance to play the actual game, the miniatures and system seem pretty straight forward. Where most other games are purely tactical, Robotech RPG Tactics adds in character cards and special equipment to mix up the battles. Each special character has unique abilities to enhance the tactical play. Strangely, the cards are lightly laminated, and you are expected to write on them with an oil pencil. I don't recommend this as the lamination won't hold up to repeated use. It would be better to make copies of these cards and print them out for each battle or get them professionally laminated.

I have been a fan of Robotech since I was a kid so getting my hands on these miniatures is extremely nostalgic to me. I have played Battletech for years and was drawn to it, in part, by its use of Robotech mechs in their books. However, that system seemed slow and clunky and never seemed to fit the high paced battles in Robotech. These new rules seem much simpler, faster, and deadly - perfect for Robotech.

The box set requires a lot of work and the miniatures are better described as models. They seem to have been designed based on much larger scale models as there are far too many parts to be glued together for such tiny miniatures. And when I say tiny, I mean it. Some of the parts you are expected to glue on are little more than slivers of plastic. If you are not a skilled modeler, you probably want to avoid this pack as it will have you screaming in frustration.

While the destroids and the Zentradi pods go together fairly easily, the Veritech battleoids are a real pain. The destroids really only have a couple of simple options to choose from. But the veritechs have multiple arm configurations, and it is not entirely clear which arms go to which guns. Besides that, when you try to glue them together, you will be forced to make some uncomfortable guesses as to the positioning of the arms and guns, and @#@%@!%@$

But, once you've got these models together, they are beautiful and really reflect the look and feel of the Robotech mechs. You will need to paint the miniatures to really complete the look. And if you play CAV or Battletech, you can use the destroids and veritechs as they are very close to the Battletech scale. The Zentradi units, though, are too big. I'm not that concerned about the scale so much and I plan on using the officer's pod as the Battletech Marauder despite it being much larger than the Battletech scale.

I was disappointed that the box set didn't come with a basic map. Most games of this scale and cost include some sort of battle map, even if it is just a cheap, fold-out poster. With no battle map, I feel like this isn't a complete game. Sure, most people already have some sort of 3D terrain or paper maps, but it seems like such an oversight and for the price, I expected to have some sort of battlefield based on Macros City or the deck of the SDF-1.

If you like giant mech battles and the Robotech universe, this is the only source for this kind of game and despite the frustration of building the miniatures, the end result feels worth it.",4.0
"All in all not a bad little game, certainly for a company's first attempt.  It's not perfect however.

Gameplay:  Rules are quite simple for the most part, most complex thing to worry about is is building your force, and a basic dice roll with an added value compared to another value (Say, shooting, D6 + Gunnery needs meet or beat Armor).  Turns move fast, with players able to act and react to oneanother in various ways.  Missiles coming in on you?  Use anti missile weapons or burn command points to dodge, or if another model is close it could try and take some of the damage for you.  You can steal activation from someone (And prevent it) to throw a spanner in the works for someone, though it's not easy.  Each of the three factions have unique rules, Human pilots want to be the top gun and one up each other, letting you get more shots if they see their mates taking out the enemy.  Zentrati care little for their men, as they know they have millions more at their disposal, Their rule lets them call in re-enforcement waves when units die close to commanders (So long as they have a rule called Life is Cheap), the same rule lets you ignore the normal restriction that would keep you from shooting allies, letting you take out your own men (you can always call on more afterall) if they would be blocking line of sight to the rest of your forces, or let one poor guy pin someone down in hand to hand combat before raining fire on the two.  Included in the book are a number of scenario options, almost all of which are modular to create unique missions and goals for the game, in addition, there are fully fleshed out campaign rules for running extensive, interconnected games with branching paths.

Creating your army is done through unit cards that have listed stats, special skills/weapons, point values and upgrades, though the book doesn't have the point values or the faction rules, so don't loose the cards!  Get some protectors, they will be used a lot.  That said, the cards are dry erase, with boxes to note the amount of health each unit has and ammunition for certain weapons.

Miniatures are a bit of a mixed bag though the human models are incredibly fiddly, having 12+ parts in some cases for a model that is only a few inches tall, some of which look to be as thin as a pin.  Zentrati models fare better here, but they also have some very small guns.  If you have experience with miniature building then you can find a way, but if not then you will struggle.  This is made all the worse with spurs that are not labeled, letting you know which arms go to which pose, or which head may be the match for your mech.  The instructions are little better, having no step-by-step guide and providing only one view, something which may not show the direction the feet are facing.  It's not easy, but after you build a couple you will get the hang of it.

Included in the box are two sets of custom dice, one for the Humans one for the Zentrati, a template, rule book, tokens for the command points, the needed cards for units, characters and detailed stats and decals.

Overall, the fun you have playing makes up for the bad, but there is room for improvement.  The company is new to this, though they are old salts at RPGs, and it shows with the way many of the stats and information is handled.

And yes, the kickstarter was handled rather poorly (At the time of writing this, there are still a number of EU backers that don't have their pledges despite the company now selling it in the states and canada) and they didn't handle information or shipping well.  That shouldn't impact the game itself, so try to keep that in mind if you see negative reviews from kickstarter backers.  Gamers are a passionate bunch, we want what we want, when we want it (like many) but I'm not reviewing their handling of the launch or their business practices, this is just for the game.",4.0

"In contrast to what others may say, the game is made from good quality plastic materials.

The kickstarter that funded this project ran over a year late, which has led some to believe erroneously that the game would not be published, it has been.  Shipping to backers is estimated to be completed early next year worldwide.

The models do suffer from a high parts count, but not excessively so.  I would say they're no more difficult than comparable GW miniatures.

The rule set is fun, and easy to learn.  There are a few issues with ambiguous rules, but nothing that will not be cleared up by a FAQ.

The product does have a few flaws, as any first edition game does.  This is to be expected.

While not a perfect product the game is fun.  There are a great many models to assemble (and paint if you choose), so the investment in time in order to play is fairly high.

cute puppet-the only reason I did n't give the full 5 stars was the same complaint i have seen elsewhere- -only 1 button pops off so it doesn't really follow the story- I actually ended up removing all the buttons and reattaching with velcro- not a tough job but makes Pete follow his story better. Granddaughter loved it!,4.0
"Like some of the other reviews, I was disappointed that only one button comes off the jacket. The premise of the book is about 4 buttons coming off.  My grand daughter likes to do the 'take away' or subtract the one button from the total buttons. We can do that with the book, but not with the puppet. On the plus side, she loves the size of this Pete - it fits her little hand and she can hold him up pretending to lose his buttons. I may try to devise a way for each button to come off.",4.0

I am a story teller for a county library system and I love Pete the Cat.  I was so happy when I saw that there is now a puppet.  The kids love him as well.  They love his belly button.  The puppet combines small aspects of all the books.,4.0
"This puppet is cute, seems well made, and is a nice likeness to the Pete from the books.  As other reviewers have noted, it would be better if all of the buttons were attached with velcro and therefore removable, for greater fidelity to the story (and increased amusement for kids who like to play with the puppet while reading along with the story).  If it hadn't been for this fact, I would have given it 5 stars.",4.0
"My grandson absolutely LOVES the book and asks me to read it repeatedly.  I have the ""Pete the Cat"" stuffed toy and he plays with it while I read the stories to him (and I actually was considering making a shirt with velcro buttons to reinact with the story).  After seeing the puppet, I just had to get it.  It is a nice size and is easy to maneuver.  My only disappointment is that only one of the buttons pops off (it is attached by a string so it won't get lost or disappear in little one's mouth) which I feel won't be as big a hit with the kiddies when reading the story because in the story, all 4 buttons pop off to reveal his belly button, and I believe my grandson will be trying to pop off all of the buttons and become disappointed when that doesn't happen.  I guess I will still make a yellow shirt for the stuffed toy where the four buttons can pop off, and will sew a ""belly button"" on the toy as well.  That way, it flows with the story in exact detail and my grandson will be able to reinact.  Thus, that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I think it will still be a hit with the little ones and would recommend.  I feel it would be great to have in a classroom for a Preschool or Kindergarten teacher story aide.

Addendum:  I failed to mention that the shirt does close with velcro, and when opened does reveal a belly button on the puppet.  I discovered that on my own as it was never mentioned when I placed my order to get it.  Now my grandson likes to open the shirt revealing the belly button. ;)",4.0

"My daughter and I love the Llama Llama series so I bought this as a Christmas gift to compliment her book collection. It's good quality but a little smaller than expected. Yes, I see that it's 13.5 inches but still seemed a little small. Overall, good product although a little pricey.",4.0

"This doll came on time when it was scheduled to so my daughter was not disappointed. We picked it up at our Walmart, she came with me and was she ever excited.

"My 2 year old grandson loves to be read to.  As a retired elementary school teacher, I have lots of favorite books.  Found some new favorites with the llama Llama red pajama series. This stuffed llama seemed the perfect companion for our reading time.  Just a bit disappointed in the glued on felt buttons.  I have a feeling that my curious little grandson will be trying to peel those off soon.  Otherwise, a llama to cuddle during story time and to use as an imagination prompt as we develop our own adventures.",4.0
I have to praise amazon for having this product at a great price.  We actually picked one up at Barnes and Noble and I couldn't bring myself to pay $20+ dollars for a simple stuffed animal that feels painfully like a claw-machine reject.

"My toddler LOVES the Llama Llama books so I thought this would be a great addition to his other stuffed animals.  He loves it and sleeps with it...I only have one problem - he keeps taking the clothes off!  They are sucured with one little stitch in the back, but I have a feeling he'll eventually break that and they will come completly off.  I just wish they were secured all the way around.  Not a deal breaker, just a minor frustration.  But otherwise, very cute to go with his books.",4.0

"Llama Llama is nicely detailed and a great representation of books' illustrations. One heads up though: this is a smaller stuffed animal (13.5 inches) and has a firmer, thinner body than many stuffed animal you may already own. My two year old nephew loves him, but this Llama Llama just wasn't the super squishy, floppy animal his Mom and I were expecting.",4.0
"Overall this is a nice stuffed doll. My 2 year old knew exactly what it was when I pulled it out of the box.

"I purchased the entire Llama Llama book series for my granddaughter, so I think having the plush is a natural fit. I envision readnig the books to her as she holds the toy. I was a bit taken aback by how small the toy is for the price, but at least it is cute. I would still buy it.",4.0
"A really great gift for a sweet 2 year old!  She simply loves  all the llama stories.

"My son loves to recite the No More Monkeys Jumping on the Bed story.  When I bought him the book with all 5 stories I saw these to go along with it. They're cute, and he does enjoy them but they're a tad be awkward.  They're too big to really be finger puppets on an adult's hand, let alone a 3 year old's hand. They do velcro together so they can hold hands and you can make them jump.  He was excited about them, but they aren't really a favorite of his.  I probably wouldn't pay that much money for them again.",4.0

Exactly what my daughter wanted. Mead seem heavy duty and more reliable than the folders you have to choose from in stores. She didn't want the ones that cost .15 but would rip within two months use. So I ordered these. Great designs. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price. I found cheaper directly through Mead but wanted the fast shipping that Amazon offered.,4.0

Working as an electrician in the construction trade for 34 years. This is the best and most versatile ratchet drive that I have ever used. Not only it is a dual drive;It is also compact and light which means a lighter tool bag to carry.

We could not get the computer and printer to work together with it, but I don't think that was the cables fault because we put the old cable back on and then it didn't work either, so I think the port in one unit or the other went out.",4.0

"This is standard fare for Barbie. The only hang up I have is indicative of all their equestrian toys - they are made of hard plastic - fairly strong - but not solid enough in legs so a random stomp by a little brother or sister can leave the stallion or mare quite literally without a leg to stand on. However, my daughter has been more diligent in her storage and the toy has held up to lots and lots and lots of play. Purple unicorn is a must for many little ladies.",4.0

My daughter's face lit up when she opened it on Christmas Morning and right away she wanted to play with it, brush it's hair, take off the saddle, etc! It has now been dragged all over the house by its mane or tail or unicorn horn but still looks amazing. I saw another reviewer recommending to glue the crown to the unicorn. I forgot to do this, and the crown did fall off but I eventually found it and now it's super-glued to the unicorn's head and isn't going anywhere. I'm very happy with this toy, the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the unattached crown.",4.0

First time buying framelits they are really nice. I like the idea of stamping the image and then cutting out the image on the Cuttlebug. I need to buy more! Great idea!,4.0

($38.00) I had seen it at Walmart for less than 20.00 but it was sold out. :(  I was crazy to purchase it but you know how it goes when they love it ""sooooooo much."" It is a beautiful horse and nice size for Barbies and other dolls of this type. The mane and tail are pretty but become frizzy when brushed. Braiding helps keep them nice and so does using small elastic bands.",4.0

"I have used many rechargeable drills and saws over the years.
Old battery technologies are finicky, heavy, and die when left unused............

This set of tools has the performance of previous models with better battery technology in a smaller size.

So far I have used the drill and reciprocating saw. Have not yet used the circular saw.

I grab the drill often- even though I have several others to choose from. Power, size, and speed control are good.

On the downside, the flashlight seems an after thought and is built like it.
I used it once and it died.

I will follow up as I use these more.

So far, the real tools perform well.",4.0
Bought this item to go with my new Samsung 42in LED Smart TV.  It was easy to mount to the wall if you have a stud finder or have some good screw-in drywall mounts handy.  The bolt lenth and the adapters did not fit the new tv.  Trip to Lowes for 4 correct bolts and it went up ok.  Make sure you have help when hanging the TV.  Lay it all out and then go to the hardware store.  Looks and works great when complete.,4.0

"This is my first set of cordless tools.  I had some old corded hand me downs from my dad and felt it was time to get a set.  I don't use them a whole lot but wanted something nice for when I did need them.  These are used tools, so they have some minor scratches but they work just fine.  For the discount it is the way to go.
The batteries work just like everyone says.  They give full power until the every end and they just quit.  The power indicator on the battery is a nice feature.
The drill is the smaller of the two (450 in-lbs I think) but still has plenty of power to drill through 2x4s, cabinets, other stuff around the house.",4.0
"After seeing with my own eyes how the food my friend had cooked did not stick, I was sold.  I love the size of the pot.  Wide enough and not too tall.  Easy to saute and mix my food in it.  The lids handle wasn't even hot after covering up my pot while cooking.  My friend and I went on a shopping find for this item and was not able to find it even in William Sonoma stores and trust me we went to alot of stores.  I made up my mind that I will own one of this pot and was able to find it in the internet.  I love to cook for my family and friends and when I cook I cook in big amount.  I love it so much I ordered another one.  I also bought a wok in William Sonoma store in clearance same brand.  I have a two sets of Kitchen Aid and now I just use my Calphalon all the time.

"First of all, I'll point out that I'm just an average cook.  I got this product free with purchase of a Calphalon One set. It's a great piece of cookware, I've been very satisfied with the all the outcomes.  It has been very convenient going from stove top to the oven and the nonstick feature makes it very easy to clean.  Great alternative to the crock pot as far as taste.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because the bottom of the pan, looking in, started to become a faint multi-color.. not sure if this is supposed to happen.  It's not rust, it's still smooth and definitely still usable, but it's just no longer solid black.",4.0

However, we had 20 people instead of the 8 recommended and it just really didn't work as well (we created new supporting characters to supplement it).I  Highly suggest using it just for 8 people. Even then, it can be complicated and detailed, so choose participants who are patient and pay attention! Enjoy",4.0
"This was very much fun and had my friends on the edge of their seats to turn the page and find out what crazy things their person did next.

The costumes are fairly easy to assemble.  The food was good, and optional.  I recommend choosing food that can be prepared ahead of the game.  Or play it at a restaurant meeting room.

Costumes were incredible, food was right out of a Roman Feast (got ideas online, rather than suggestions that came with the game).
We've discovered that giving each suspect a copy of their players manual (sans last page) prior to the party, really helps them understand their part and keeps the game flowing along without loss of clues or confusion.  This was one of our favorites!",4.0
"I would recommend the game to anyone. The game is a lot of fun.  The ""Princess Bride"" theme added a fun party atmosphere. My only complaint is that the movement tokens could have been designed better. I should explain that I have played with Aaron the game mechanic's designer. He originally designed the game with a different theme. He still hopes to get it re-released with his original theme. I had him explain the game to me and the differences the two themes have. Also he said, there was some problem with the written instructions and the translation from his original theme, to the ""Princess Bride"" theme.  No offense to Aaron, however I like the ""Princess Bride"" theme better than his other theme. In addition I found no problem with the rulebook. It was very easy to follow.",4.0
"It is very rare that we get pop culture themed games that are actually worth playing twice, I can see this making it to the game table quite often.  Though I enjoyed the actual game play, I would have liked to see more movie quotes from this games.  I would also like to see a deluxe version.  I would have spent another $10.00 to get pewter or even plastic pawns, instead of the cardboard ones that are included in the game.",4.0

"It's fun, but a bit repetitive. Wish there were more variation in the cards. Be sure to watch the movie first!",4.0
"It's a very simple game but that's not a bad thing. Basically you use cards to make your way towards the castle to win. There are very few rules and they're all pretty basic. Overall it's a fun little time waster and people who like the Princess Bride will probably get a little more enjoyment out of it purely because it relates to the book/film. However, for people looking for a deep game, you won't find it here. This game is quick and simple.",4.0

Everything as expected.  A well intentioned and fun game.  More complex than you would think.  Would recommend to friends.  Seems to be well thought out.,4.0
"This game is really cool... if you're as big of a Princess Bride fan as I am. I love the innovative use of the situations of the film in a card game. Essentially, you place tiles to mark the obstacles on the way to, well, storming the castle. These tiles include the pit of despair, the cliffs of insanity, and other locations from the film. You use cards from your hand to help you get through the obstacles, make more obstacles for the other player, or get more/different cards. The first one to get past all their tiles to the castle is the winner! I really enjoyed the game, but the rest of my family (who enjoy the film, but haven't seen it the bazillion and a half times I have; nor have they read the book) was only humoring me by playing. The game is pretty complicated to get started, especially if you don't have a solid grasp on all the aspects of the film. I would only recommend this if you are a HUGE fan, and if you know other big fans who would enjoy this type of game.",4.0
"I normally do not buy ""branded"" games because they are often only good for a few plays before they become boring. In any case, my entire family loves ""The princess bride"". When I saw ""Storming the Castle"" as a game option on Exodus's shelves there was no question that it would become a Christmas present for my husband who is the biggest ""princess bride"" fan in our house!

We played ""Storming the Castle"" for the first time tonight. I am very happy with the durable quality of the cards and the pieces in the box, with one exception. The stand easily comes off the character, which could be frustrating during game play. We avoided the issue entirely by hot-gluing the stand to the character before play. Problem solved.

The instructions were well written for the most part, but left us confused on a couple of instances. But we decided to play the game anyway to see how it would play out. Most of our questions were figured out in this first round of play, we had fun, and laughed the entire time.

After tucking the children into bed, I went online to see if I could find answers the remaining questions about the game. As it turns out, ""Storming the castle"" was originally designed by Aaron Watson as a different game, but was re-themed to a ""princess bride"" game by the publisher. The game designer was not involved in the re-themeing process in any way. Most of our confusion arose from the re-themeing.

As far as those pesky questions go... I was able to find the answers, so our second play of ""Storming the Castle"" will make much more sense... and will likely be a roudy, competitive, all around good time.

4 Stars for a fun family game, it would have been 5 stars except for the confusion surrounding one particular card.",4.0

"After receiving this expansion for the wonderful Arkham Horror base game we decided to go all out and throw every expansion we has onto the playing field. With the maximum investigators so we could have people covering all points, we gave it a shot. Many a player were devoured, and many and old gods broke the seal and destroyed our world, but it was so much fun. The new Kingsport field was aimed at giving the players a bit more survivability, but the damage that could be done from a Rift opening was immense. Thoroughly enjoyable and well worth it. If you want your players to survive better, you can just include the playing field additions. Personally, we saw moving portals because of the Rifts opening, and it was a lot of fun having to deal with a portal opening, moving and then another one opening behind it.

It adds new elements to pretty much every aspect of the base set: new investigators, new gates, new items, new encounters, new monsters, and (last but not least) the Epic Battle variation which adds a significant and challenging twist to your last stand against the Ancient One. But this expansion is more than just markers and mechanics: it also introduces characters and locations from a wide variety of Lovecraft's writings into the game, making his world larger - and more frightening - whether you play with all of Kingsport or just mix a few extra cards into the standard game.

4 1/2 stars, rounded down because I find the rift progress mechanic unwieldy (but still fun).",4.0
"I had first read about the World of Warcraft board game in an issue of Game Informer.  How could a game as epic as WoW could be made into a board game?  What about all the small details everyone loves from the PC game?  PvP?  Raids? Loot?  Rest assured, it's all here.

This game is HUGE.  That's the only word for it.  There are over 1,000 pieces.  Anyone curious about the steep price tag, trust me, you get what you pay for.  The pieces are very well sculpted.  The character pieces are not painted (would have been nice), and the monsters could not be painted.  Monsters are a fairly unattractive array of blue, green and red.  Everything else in the box (including the box itself) looks great.  The amount of graphics from the PC game are endless.  Fans will love to see how much graphic detail was put into the visuals of this game.

Like many of FFG's games, there are a ton of rules.  They aren't hard, there's just alot.  I won't go into detail on them, but instead say what I don't like.  The setup time for this game takes forever.  There's just so many pieces and cards that need to be set up and distributed.  If you have several players and everyone helps, it isn't so bad.  But if it's just two players, get ready for 30-45 minutes of setup.

The game is extremely long.  Not really a bad thing, since it is alot of fun, but the downtime between each player's turn can make for some boredom.  The more players, the worse it is.

And my third and final gripe is that there really isn't an incentive to fight independent monsters.  Some monsters are fought to complete quests, but random monsters are ""generated"" with each new quest card.  And independent monsters are tough!  It's mandatory to fight them if you encounter them, and being as difficult as they are, some reward should have been given.  This problem is addressed in the expansion ""Shadow of War.""

Fans of the PC game curious about the game shouldn't be deterred by my comments however.  This is a great buy for any WoW fan with alot of time to kill.  It's not perfect, but impressive none the less.",4.0
"In terms of playability, Kingsport is much better than Innsmouth as it actually gives you some bonuses and things to do that help the investigators out. It also doesn't have an endgame trigger the way that the Innsmouth track does.

My Arkham friends and I play with this and Dunwich and not a lot else.",4.0
This expansion adds aquatic destinations to your board as well as a new town. We had a lot of fun playing with this but just like the other bigger expansions this is something that takes time and effort to learn. Since it's an expansion I would assume you have the actual Arkham Horror game in which case you would know this is not a casual game.,4.0
"The Lord of the Rings board game is, amongst my group of friends, something of a classic. It's a difficult, engaging, and fun board game for a group, though it is not without its flaws. It carries the art style of the classis Tolkien books and is not related to the movies (though of course the plot is the same).

Gameplay:
Each of the players (up to 5) plays one of the hobbits from the books (including Fatty Bolger, who is included in the game even though he was left out of the recent movies). The goal is for the hobbits to trek the one ring to Mt. Doom before Sauron can claim it as his own. To do so, players will need to work together to draw and play cards allowing them to move through each section of the story successfully. While doing so, they will often draw cards or run into scenarios in which Sauron will draw closer to victory. There is a bit of luck and a good deal of strategy involved.

Difficulty:
This is one of those games that is going to take a while to fully learn. After a round or two, most people will have gotten the rules for the most part, and won't have to consult the rulebook as often. It will, however, still require some attention to detail to master. Also, the game (Sauron) usually seems to win. In my book, that's a plus since it makes the rare wins all the more meaningful.

Time:
I would say that a game usually takes about an hour, though this can vary a bit depending on the number of players and their level of familiarty with the game.

The Game itself:
The game itself has some really lovely boards with full-color drawings of Middle Earth. The cards are also quite nice. The pieces for the hobbits themselves are a bit lackluster, but everything is pretty sturdy, and you shouldn't have any problem keeping this game for quite a while.

In conclusion, I think this game is a great buy for LOTR fans who enjoy a boardgame experience a little more invovled than the LOTR branded Monopoly and Stratego. In my experience, people tend to really enjoy the game once they pick it up.",4.0
"It took a little while to get used to the rules, but it's pretty good. I collect anything LOTR anyway, so it was a good bet I would have purchased it even if it was terrible. The artwork on the cover of it is good.",4.0
"This game is a favorite of a couple of friends of mine with whom I play regularly.  We have a ball trying to get the Ring into the Crack of Doom and sometimes it can get frustrating as the cards or the Events don't go our way.

This game is pretty abstract, though.  There is no ""moving your hero to this spot and rolling for an attack against the Nazgul"" in this game, but you basically move tokens through the board in order to try to advance through each board without your Hobbit becoming too corrupted by the influence of Sauron.  You use cards to move the tokens as well as try to block adverse effects on yourself.

I personally really like this one. If  you are an LotR fan and don't mind a game which doesn't have a lot of ""action"" (by ""action"" I mean moving pieces and making attack rolls), you will likely like this game.",4.0
"Good game, although the rule book is rather badly written. Confusing, jumps around all over the place, and makes it feel as though there are a LOT of rules.
What is awesome though is Amazon's service: after the first package arrived damaged they performed their usual sterling service to sort it out for us.",4.0
"This is a good game with a lot of replay ability.  You have to find the right people to play with and understand how the game flows.  If you make sure to read the rules and understand how the game is played, it becomes a very fun game that can be played many times over.  I enjoy this game very much.  I recommend it to anyone who likes Fantasy Flight and Reiner Knizia.",4.0
"My husband and I have only played a couple times, but it is definitely harder than Pandemic or House on the Hill(sic).

This edition contains slightly different rules than the original release.  It is helpful to have both.  The other rules can be found at Boardgamegeek.",4.0
"So first off, the directions on how to play this game that come with it are HORRIBLE! It took us a long time to figure out exactly how to play and were constantly searching for things we didn't find answers to.
Eventually we figured it out and things started to flow smoother although we only made it to the helms deep scenario. Also this newer version of the game is definitely made cheaper than the original but it still works.
It does have a luck element to it which I really don't like but since it is lord of the rings and cooperative than I deal with it.

Overall, it is a fun game. Be prepared to do a lot of learning and reading the rule book before getting a complete understanding of how the game works and should be played.",4.0
"Like the novels, this game can come across as quite the endeavour if you plan to finish it.
Do not start this game with people who are not ready to play a long game that can be sometimes tedious but also at times very exciting!
When Sauron starts to move, you'll see why this game is such a challenge to beat.
If you've got time, patience and determination to see it through, you'll have fun.",4.0
"This was a fun game. It is extremely difficult to win, however, and it takes a long time to complete the game.",4.0
"Middle Earth Quest is a game where up to three hero players compete against a single Sauron player for either a historical result or a new ending. If the heros win, the ring is safe for now and Frodo is able to begin his quest, but if Sauron wins then it is the end of Middle Earth.

The game starts out with a lot of options for each hero and the Sauron player. Almost too many. The learning curve is steep. Trying to figure out how best to spend your resources and keep an edge at the beginning of the game is daunting.

While the game will eventually end with an artificial type timer. It can get long. Hero turns can get to be very long especially when the heros arn't taking the time during other players turns to think about what they will do next. Because of this th game can last anywhere from 2 to 5 hours depending on how casual your group is with games, the more casual, the longer it will take.

Once you get passed all the choices and start to figure out what the best moves are from the beginning the game really shines. It is very much a cat an mouse game where the heros try their best to stay one step ahead of Sauron and his plots. If they faulter for just a couple turns it can mean that Sauron will catch up and make it very difficult for the heros to overcome him at that point.

A lot of strategy, oozing with Lord of the Rings theme this game plays well and is a lot of fun if you can get over the learning curve and the amount of time it takes to finish. Those two factors, time and learning curve, are what keep it from being a 5 star to me and earn it 4.",4.0
"Hubby and I are avid board strategy gamers and are delighted to add this to our collection. The game is challenging, varied, and interesting.  We love the context of it being set between The Hobbit and LOTR; our familiarity with the settings, characters and conflicts mentioned in the game is enjoyable, but the game smartly avoids re-living battles and re-creating character conflicts from the books.  Instead the setting simply provides a rich back story to your plot choices and decisions.  Many reviewers have mentioned the time it takes to learn the game, and while this is true, we have had an easier time with it than with most other games of similar complexity, perhaps due to well-written instructions and few ambiguous situations popping up during play.  While the overall game design, the artistry, and game play all receive high marks, for us the game stands out for offering different types of play (you can play as Sauron or as a Hero) and for its high replayability.  So far it's the only game we've found that rivals Mansions of Madness for enoyability and different gameplay experiences.  Works well as a two-player game for us but it's better if the character playing the Hero plays at least two Heroes.",4.0

"This game is fun.  Overall it is basically a land control strategy game.  It is nice to see they made an effort to try to keep with the books and Fantasy Flight made a good product, very good quality.  The first time you play the game might be a bit complicated and a bit confusing, but after a round or two you get he idea and it become easier to understand and thus more fun.  Play with at least 5 players, it makes the game more fun.  It is a good game that allows for good strategy and deception.",4.0
"My son and I have purchased all the Arkham Horror expansions.  This is the latest one.  It is a big expansion, with lots of materials and an additional game board.

A person needs the base Arkham Horror set to go with this expansion, in order to play it.

We set up the game with the base set and this new expansion, but put away materials from other, earlier expansions.  This gives the new expansion more of an opportunity to be fully appreciated.

Generally, this may be the toughest expansion yet.  Every game has players battling a Great Old One, as is always the case.  The new Great Old Ones that come with this set are very challenging.  New features include a private challenge for each investigator, which adds interest.  There are also about 275 new cards to be added to the original game deck.  The price for this expansion is a bit stiff, but Amazon prices it with a major discount compared to other sources.  And you do get ""lots more stuff.""

Anyway, we have been having great fun with the new Innsmouth Expansion.  We only win about half the time -- that adds to the fun.

The art work and creative imagination of the game designers have paid off in a terrific game.

Note:  The website associated with this game encourages that players create ""house rules.""  In other words, players can get together and agree to modify the official game rules in various ways.  So if the game seems too difficult, it is easy to make a few adjustments, thereby ensuring success at least part of the time.

Those who own the original Arkham Horror game will probably get great fun and entertainment out of the new set.

For any interested, the new Innsmouth Horror expansion is based on a novelette by H.P. Lovecraft, entitled ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth.""  Some of you may enjoy checking this out of the library and reading it. It is included in most collections of Lovecraft's short fiction. This reading will enrich the game experience for you.

Great game but super complicated. Took way too much time to initially figure out the correct way it is supposed to be played.,4.0
"Overall I wasn't That impressed with Innsmouth. There usually isn't a lot of motivation to visit the innsmouth board, as in order to reset the deep one rising track requires a lot of clues, and unless you have certain characters present, those clues are better spent sealing gates.
The aquatic monsters while cool in concept there are so few aquatic locations that this is something that almost never enters play. The two aquatic locations on the new board are so difficult to get to and from that I have never seen anyone visit them in dozens of times playing. The positive thing about this board is finally fixing the problem in the base game where more portals getting sealed makes the game easier. The Deep One Rising track increases when a portal should open in a sealed location, making it much more difficult to manage when the ancient one will awaken.

The real meat of the expansion is in the new Investigators and Ancient ones. More variety in a game that is all about variety? Perfection. This is solid content and to be expected. What wasn't to be expected were the optional personal story cards. These add a little personal quest to each investigator in the game with pass fail rules, adding more uniqueness to each character.

Overall it's only a so-so expansion with some pretty major highlights.",4.0

"This game is a blast to play even if you know nothing at about GOT. The combat system while on surface appears to be  very simple, the House card system can make the outcomes very unpredictable and adds a huge element of surprise which generates screams of anguish from the defeated and smirks of satisfaction from the victory. The directions are well written and along with the several excellent walk through and strategy videos on Youtube had me and my sons up and playing in a very short time. While most of our games have been 3 player, we have played one 4 player match and found the chaos increases with more people. Our 4th is now hooked on the game and we have a 5th that wants to try it. I cannot wait ! If strategy board games are some thing that you enjoy, you should certainly give this game a look.",4.0
"As someone who usually plays Arkham Horror at least once or twice a month and has played all the previous expansions, I think this one is a good addition.  I like it better than Kingsport, and even a bit better than Dunwich, though that might be because it's still new (only played it 2 times so far).  The added characters are interesting and the new character goals are fun and give you something to work toward during turns when there's nothing else for your character to do.  This board doesn't add any new portal locations, but instead just has two tracks.  If one of them fills up (tokens are added when gates fail to open due to elder tokens or when monsters move into holes like the ones in Dunwich) the ancient one awakens.  You can clear that track by filling another track with clue tokens (you must be in an Innsmouth street or location during upkeep to put up to 2 clue tokens on the appropriate color.  There are 3 colors so you need a total of 6 clue tokens, taking at least 3 turns to fill up this track, so you want to partially fill it before it becomes a problem).

It also adds some interesting gate cards for the base set portal locations, several of them doing something crazy if you're in a specific location (example: there was one that you kept and after a certain number of gates opened, your character got devoured, but in the meantime it gave you good bonuses).

I haven't yet played this expansion with either of the previous large expansions, so I can't really comment on the interactions.",4.0

Hardcore Arkham Horror fans are going to buy every expansion anyway, so they may safely stop reading here.

Let me now address owners of the base game wondering if this is the first (or next) expansion they should buy. The answer is yes, if you routinely play with 4 or more people and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shadow-Over-Innsmouth/dp/B0010PBI4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shadow Over Innsmouth</a>&nbsp;is one of your favorite stories. Groups of 3 players or less will need to play with multiple investigators each to have any conceivable chance of beating the game (or even making an attempt worth setting up the board for) due to multiple elements designed to delay investigators and RAPIDLY awaken the Ancient One.

When my wife and I play by ourselves, most of this expansion stays in the box. We have incorporated the encounters and monsters into the base set to good effect (adding greater variety without skewing things significantly) and have enjoyed spicing things up with new investigators and personal stories, but - all things considered - we should have bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dunwich/dp/1589942841/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dunwich</a>&nbsp;first.",4.0
"This review primarily revolves around the Arkham, base game, Innsmouth Horror expansion.  For those that came across this game and have never played Arkham Horror, well be aware that this is the third ""board"" expansion of the Arkham Horror series. Arkham Horror, the base game, is a complicated board game filled with many kinds of pieces and a book of rules. The Innsmouth Horror expansion adds several more elements including a new town to visit, Innsmouth, with several new locations and an additional track that causes the investigators problems if it fills. The track is somewhat similar to that of the Dunwich Horror.

All in all, I personally enjoy this expansion. Furthermore, I tend to play the Arkham Horror base game, Dunwich Horror board expansion and Innsmouth Horror expansion. I would add that my other gamer friends are quite frustrated with the expansion as they tend to complain that they game is just too big. The ""too big"" comment refers to having more problems to solve in order to win the game.  I, however, find the expansion to add another complicated dimension and that increases the fun factor for me. Additionally, there are new investigators, monsters, cards and rules. I enjoy having more complications and don't mind losing and descending into some unspeakable horror. Again, my friends do not appreciate these additional problems.

For those of you new to this series of games, this review is probably not helpful as you should read the reviews for the Arkham Horror base game and start from that point. For those that are interested in purchasing this expansion, Arkham Horror only becomes more complicated and harder to win. Again, several of my gaming friends find the game to be too difficult with this expansion. I would add that it does increase the difficulty and I find that we lose more games. However, if you enjoy a wider array of characters to play, new bad guys and more location cards, I would recommend that you buy the expansion. If the game is too complicated, you can always just mix and match the parts you want. Good luck and don't let the horrors of Arkham get you down. It is, after all, only a game.",4.0

"So much fun! The game has a lot of parts and is very complicated. Expect to take some time studying the instructions before you play, and even then taking a few rounds for players to realize exactly what they are doing. The game says that it only takes 3 - 4 hours, but it took us over 6. While the game looks like a form of Risk, it is not nearly as logic based. The primary focus of this game is politics, alliances, and deceit. The game reportedly ruins friendships, so be sure that you are not too sensitive about what happens in the game! The game ends after 10 rounds or whoever has 7 castles/strongholds first. Here is a synopsis of our game:
I started out as the head of house Martell. I quickly made secret alliances with my northern neighbors of the western end of Westeros (Tyrells and Greyjoys). They would bid their alliances away throughout the game, so trust that ours was intact was not an easy thing. I moved throughout the southern end of the country building up a footprint, an army front, and power, while those in the center fought tooth and nail to expand and maintain borders. I was finally able to overtake the Iron Throne in the final rounds, but that brought focus to me. My northern Tyrell neighbor broke the truce and attacked, leaving an opening for the Baratheons to attack and overtake my capitol. Up until now, I have slowly gone through and overtook 5 castles in the game, but now my focus moved from expansion to maintenance. While all this drama was going on, the Lannisters swept through and grabbed lands with minimal forces and won the game.",4.0

"This game is no joke. You can't bring it over to a friend's casual gathering and say, 'Hey, let's play the Game of Thrones Board Game!' without warning people first. It has an exhaustive amount of rules and sub-rules that all intertwine with each other, leading to a required hour-plus of explaining to first-timers and an untold number of minutes squabbling about minute clarifications that could make or break an entire strategy. Turns can last up to an hour or more as players take their time scheming, strategizing, and agonizing over past choices; and there are ten turns, or seven castles to capture, whichever comes first (the last game I played took use 3 hours to reach four castles apiece -- you can imagine how long the entire game lasted). The game itself is woefully unbalanced, with Lannisters especially taking a beating while the Starks can slide in to victory without ever firing a shot if they play their cards right. It's a mess with any player number other than the max 6, with the balancing tipping further and further askew with each missing player. The pieces are tiny and easily lost; the Tide of Battle cards useless and game-breaking; and the rules are never-ending and needlessly complex.

But when everything works, when everyone understands the rules, when you have six people, when everyone's moving and playing and matching each other and going to war and backstabbing each other and outbidding each other, it's magical. Amazing. Untouchable. One of the best board games ever made. An unshakable high that will have you questioning your tactics days after the game has ended. A fantastic adaption that completely captures the intrigue and warfare that makes its source material so compelling. A destroyer of friendships that will turn even the best of friends into the pettiest of enemies. A terrifically intricate experience that eschews randomness and embraces the calculated nature of hard, unchanging numbers. A deep, rewarding game that encouraged repeated play and offers unparalleled delights at high-level play. A gem. A favorite. A really, really, *really* great game.

And when it doesn't work...ah, well. At least they tried.",4.0

"Android is a Raymond Chandler tale with science fiction trappings. The cyberpunk theme and variable story outcomes for each investigator are unique in my encounters with board games. All the references and sub plots make this a feast for cyberpunk fans especially. The first game did take a lot longer to play than expected, as it was necessary to consult the rules occasionally. I enjoyed all seven hours of sleuthing and story-telling.",4.0
"I really enjoyed this game.  It is a Fantasy Flight game though, so it is a little bit on the complicated side.  Once you've played a couple times, it does really start to flow though.  I would definitely recommend this to any board game enthusiast.",4.0
"We've played this game through twice now, and I think I can now say that I enjoy it. The rules are complex, and the first time we tried to play, it took us 3 hours to get HALF WAY through the game before we ran out of time. Once you have a player or two who know the rules, the game will move quite smoothly, the ""2nd Week"" in the game goes buy very quick, as the options become more limited towards the end. The final outcome is decided by point totals. The 2nd time we played, we finished the entire game in 4 hours, and we're confident that next time it'll be finished in 3 (since we know what we're doing now).

This game is all about Characters. The game is filled with flavor text, stories, NPCs, and  character specific events. Do yourself a favor, read them all aloud for everyone to hear. Its obvious the creators put a lot of work into them, and they really solidify the style of the gameplay as your going along. We made it a table rule to always read your cards and character stories for everyone, and we enjoyed the game much more when we did that, and a lot of the characters' strategies and goals became more apparent that way as well.

Note: this game is NOT a game of ""Clue, in the future"". The game is a noir-character based strategy game, you aren't finding ""who done it"", its a strategy game about finding more evidence than the other players, and its suggested, though not definitely stated, that you're actually just pinning the crime on someone, not actually solving it... and that makes perfect sense if you allow yourself to be immersed in the game story.",4.0
"I bought this for my husband for Christmas who is a huge GOT fan and he is obsessed.  This was the first ""strategy"" game we have owned and it is great!  You do not need to be up on your GOT knowledge in order to play.  The only con is that it takes a while to learn the rules - be prepared to spend an hour or so just learning the rules and then spending a long time each game that you play with new people explaining the rules.  The best thing about this game, and I am sure any strategy game, is that it is never the same each game you play.",4.0
"Update: 5/24/2016
By now, I've played almost 10 games or so almost all of them with 5 players. As expected the game feels much more balanced now. A lot more combat. But as one commenter pointed out this game plays best with 6 players. Having 6 players forces combats and that's when things get really interesting.

I will rate this game 4.5 stars out of 5. It took at least 5 game plays to fully understand the rules and still a couple of folks in my gaming group don't get them. In general, a great game. Just make sure you have lots of snacks by your side as this can take about 3 hours or more from start to finish. Also, having a group that is willing to spend that much time is a also crucial. This is definitely not for the average gamer out there.

Previous Review:

I played only 1 game so far this past weekend. So take my comments with a grain of salt but I thought I should point out somethings.

The rule book: It's a tome, for good reason. This game is a bit complex but it is worth it. The rule book had example scenarios but some of the images are either too small or low quality making it hard to read what's on the image. It's not a deal breaker but high res images would have been really nice.

The game play: Awesome. We played with 4 players and we enjoyed it. The only problem is that a player (greyjoy) won the game without a single combat in 4 rounds. It feels like there should be at least 5 players to make it more balanced. We had exactly one combat between Stark and Baratheon and we totally enjoyed it. We wish there were more combats.

4 stars because of the imbalance in the game the rule book is A-OK. I will update the review again after I play more games with more players.",4.0

"If you love GoT, you will love all media that's associated with it hands down. However, as a game by itself, it's super complicated and one might even wonder if it's worth playing through. It's a rare game that takes several hours to learn all the rules, and every round is very involved. Main issue being there are many little mechanics for every detail of the game. This really puts a damper on the play time. Average game time is close to 6 hours for a full group of 6 if people don't know what they're doing. If they do know, time shortens but still only to 4 hours.",4.0

"Be prepared for a long afternoon or evening. This game advertises that it will take 2-4 hours to play. While I do believe this to be true, it took us 6 hours the first time we played, and that was only with four players. At the end of the first time of playing, I was left not really sure of what I had just done for the last six hours. With more practice, I'm sure the game will become more entertaining. However, it is a bit overwhelming the first time.",4.0
"This game was very hard to learn and so our first go of it was very long. I personally love an intricate and difficult board game but most of my family does not. It's a fun game with or without prior knowledge of the show, just be prepared to spend some time figuring it out.",4.0

"The Talisman 4th edition update adds a few features and some minor tweaks to a first rate game in preparation for a series of updates based on the newly released version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talisman/dp/1589944623/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talisman</a>&nbsp;this will make your older (2007 version) compatible with all new releases from this point on.

Minor aesthetic changes including the design on the back of the cards, some card art, (my constantly drawing son gives it a thumbs up) and the cardboard figures are replaced by plastic figures which if painted can be kinda cool.  There is nothing that prevents the use of the plastic standups if they are preferred and should be retained in your set in case you lose any of the figures.

The biggest change is the concept of ""fate"" as an attribute.  Each character gets a Fate value along with his others.  These are basically re-rolls that can be used to re-roll a single die OF YOUR OWN.  It adds a twist to the game and will speed it up.

There are also modifications to the board, On the Desert squares you still lose a life but you also draw a card.  Other minor modification allow you to acquire fate tokens.

If these are a prelude to a new release of Talisman City then this will be worth your while.  Note that this update is only required if you own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talisman-The-Magical-Quest-Game-Newest-Version-2007/dp/B000WSAEKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talisman The Magical Quest Game (Newest Version 2007)</a>&nbsp;however if you like the game the way it is and don't plan on using any future updates then you can live without it.

"One of my favorite games now. Takes FOREVER to play. We have tried 4 5 and 6 player. For whatever reason, 5 seemed the shortest. 6 player game took about 6 hours.

High learning curve- longer than Catan, maybe about Battlestar Galactica length. Has a cool YouTube instructional video to get you started and 2 big cheat sheets for the table, but still leaves about 100 unanswered questions when we play. We constantly found ourselves on our phones looking up Fantasy Flight forums or BoardGameGeek forums.",4.0
"Great Game. It's a updated / layered version of the old Diplomacy game with a GOT theme. Only downside (if you call it that) is that you need at least 4 players, better with more, and you will need 2-4hrs.",4.0
"This game is very fun. It is a bit daunting the first time you set out to play it because there are a lot of rules and whatnot to read through, but once you get the hang of the game it is super fun. I actually enjoy it more than the video games because you get to interact with the other players and see their reactions when you make different moves (such as attack their city or steal their resources). Make sure you have a few hours available before you start the game because you will not want to have to stop playing in the middle of it.",4.0
I personally loved this game. it was a bit unfair when playing with anything but the 6 people. because it was to easy for people who where positioned around the empty spaced to conquer the board. I would like to play again with more people. Great concept!,4.0
"Not as infinitely complex as I'd hoped for.  Often this game plays out in a finite number of ways.  I won't go into too much details (many better sources for that), but essentially the way the board is laid out only allows for so many strategies, as players often have no meaningful interaction with those on the other side of the map in the earlier parts of the game.  Don't mean to stress the negative, this game is mostly great, but this is where it's lacking for me",4.0
Game arrived undamaged and in great shape,4.0
"This was the first civ builder board game I've played.  It is basically a watered down version of the video game with a lot of the same theme and mechanics.  In fact just reading the rulebook put me in the mood to play Civ V and I've put between 8-10 hours into that game over the past week alone.  Just one more turn!

So my experience was more good than bad.  First the good.  I love the variable factions, technology tree, component variety, modular map setup, and different paths to victory.  All of this makes for a varied, very replayable game with lots of interesting choices and branching decision trees.  The social interaction is a huge boon as well, I love negotiating, scheming, threatening, and pleading with my opponents across the table.  It's also quite thematic as each faction has certain specialties and you really feel yourself improving over time as you build more advanced buildings and gain new technology and abilities.

But there was a bit of bad too.  First of all the game is long and my first play was made even longer (approaching 5 hours!) by players asking too many questions and taking too much time to take a handful of actions (especially one player in particular).  It's funny because I don't balk at spending 5+ hours playing video games and RPGs but I've figured out that's because I'm constantly doing something.  That's 5+ hours of pretty constant activity.  In this game I timed it and there were instances where I alone was waiting 30 minutes just for my next action which took a couple of seconds.  30 minutes of doing nothing is brutal and when it happens every round it wears on you.

A few of my other complaints involve parts of the system that can't really be changed.  For one there appears to be balance issues, not necessarily with the different factions (though there may be, it wasn't apparent in one play) but one of the most interesting parts of the game is the different victory conditions but they do not appear to be created equal.  Culture in particular seems very difficult to achieve and a military victory seems a little bit easier than the others.  Starting with a military focused faction would give you even more of a head-start.  And while other players can garrison to prevent this that also distracts from them achieving their own victory.  Again though, these are observations from a single play.  Also, I wish the map and movement rules were designed so that in a 4 player game all civilizations were equidistant but each player always has one opponent they are further from than the others due to the square setup and orthogonal movement but this is a minor gripe.  My biggest issue with the game is I quite dislike the combat system.  It is uninteresting, overly convoluted, and kind of stupid.  It doesn't really mimic the video game so it's not an issue of a poor attempt to translate that and with so many tried and true war games to borrow the card- or dice-driven combat systems from I think this was just a failed attempt to do something a little original.

If I ever played this game again, it would have to be under 3 conditions:  1.  This game has a ton of little fiddly components, it should be set up on the table before everyone arrives.  It's one thing if you're not sure you're going to play a game or not but this is something you plan an evening around.  That alone can cut 20+ minutes out of total play time.  2.  Everyone needs to read and, this is the important part, UNDERSTAND the rulebook before you play.  Yes, it is a deep system and yes, some stuff you can only really fully grasp after you play and you will inevitably be asking questions and flipping back through the book.  But my first play had some people asking questions (and sometimes the SAME questions over and over) about very simple concepts in the system that proved they either didn't read the rulebook or didn't understand what they were reading before playing.  3.  All players need to make a concerted effort to have their moves planned out before it is their turn.  Yes, there will be occasions where you need to slow down and consider your options, especially toward the end of the game.  But in a four player game you have 3 other player's turns to have at least made an effort to work out your strategy (not to mention I assume you've spent the whole rest of the game at least working on a guideline of what you're attempting to do) and there is no excuse for 30 minutes of downtime for a player for just one phase of one turn.  There also needs to be a player who understands the game well-enough and has a leadership mentality enforcing these guidelines, especially when it comes to telling players to ""Go!""",4.0
"There's a whole lot going on as others have said, but this is part of why you buy games like this!  Any iteration of Civilization is an epic ride and should not be expected to be short or light.  Once a few people know how to play, it's a great game to bring a new person or two in.  Good replay and looking forward to buying expansions!",4.0
"The game is very fun, but takes A LOT of time to understand how to play...",4.0
At our first time playing the game we spent over two hours reading the rules. And I really wish that was an exaggeration. We didn't even have enough time to finish an actual game. But I am looking forward to playing again some time so that must mean something.,4.0
"I played the computer game series and loved it.  We bought the board game.  It is complex, but it is delightful.  In fact, the game is so complex that you should feel free to adapt the rules and organize them along your play style.  My wife and I take time in the late afternoon to play a card or board game together, catch up on our days, and then eat dinner.  This is one of our games and our most complex game but we enjoy it every time we bring it out.",4.0
"If you like the Civilization computer game, especially 4, then you will like this board game. They get a lot of the best aspects from into a shorter easier to comprehend version. As expected it is going to leave you wanting cause of the complexity of game they are trying to transfer but it is still a blast. All the pieces are great quality, and the concepts are enjoyable. For me this is definitely a game that requires some house rules and modifications to get rid of the monotony and add more changing variables (starting tiles, no tech victory, map sizes/shape) but overall a very enjoyable experience, just be aware every change you make adds time to how long the game will take. If you start changing rules to get closer to the computer game, as i have, you will find games take 3-5 hours. But you won't be disappointed.",4.0
"I've been playing this game for a while now at first by itself and now with the ""Fame and Fortune"" expansion. We sometimes choose to play with vetoing some civ's as some are perceived as being slightly overpowered, but in my opionion they are all balanced well if you know how to play them. The game takes a long time to learn, and being a fan of the PC game does help a little as the symbols for resources will all be the same and the civ's will all be familiar.

Overall, the only reason I could not give it a perfect score is that there are one or two civs that are under powered, and it takes a long time to learn and set-up, but in the end it's worth it for the epic feeling this game gives you.",4.0
"3 minor pieces were missing and the game board itself was broken in 3rds, but it works fine and it was not a big deal",4.0
"It is great looking, and creative. The theme is pretty well integrated into gameplay too... pretty well at least. My only issue is that it is a little busy mechanically, and it takes a long time, so I don't know how often I'll be able to get friends to sit down and play. But, if you have a group, this is a much better version of Risk for adults. My only technical complaint is that I could easily see how a bad order of Westeros cards (they're shuffled randomly) could definitely make a session painfully frustrating/boring (e.g. - supply without mustering). while it's improbable, I feel like they should have been able to design a way around it.",4.0
"The Mrs. and I play a lot of Civ IV on the computer, but it's so much nicer to be able to play face to face, without us each staring at a screen.  There is a lot of setup required (thus 4 stars instead of 5), and at first the complexity was a bit overwhelming, but once we played through it the first time, we were able to get a grasp of the rules and move along smoothly.  The ""cheat sheets"" that walk you through each turn help a lot, and keep things on track.  One of the things I like most about this game is that there are so many different ways to win, and, win or lose, exploring the board and building up your civilization are exciting and different every time.",4.0

Kinda like monopoly, or the civilization games for the computer, one second it'll be 6:00 after dinner, and the suddenly it's midnight and you're not sure what's just happened. You need a good group of friends who understand board games to play this, and an understanding that this will take some time to get set up your first couple times you play. The more your practice setting it up, the faster the process will go. Over all an enjoyable game, but a game that takes time.",4.0

The cardboard components are beautiful, the plastic ones not so much yet they are stil equally as functional as the cardboard ones. This game is for great for Civ fans, especially if you do not have the patience for a full game. Also, the box is quite durable and bends right back into shape if you step on it. I know because I accidentally stepped on the box once.",4.0
"I bought this game for my fiance for his birthday.  It was a hit!  He enjoys other games similar to this, like Risk 2210, Stone Age, Dominion, Pandemic, Carcassone, etc.  The game seems to be very well balanced, with many different possible strategies and ways to win.  It seemed easy enough to understand, but very complex and hard to master, making it great to play over and over again.  The board and pieces seem very durable and well designed.  It does take awhile to set up and to read the instructions, but I think it is well worth it.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of in-depth board games.",4.0
"I purchased this board game a few months ago and now have had the chance to play through it 5 times.

Thoughts on the actual contents of the board game:
The pieces are fine, but you need a way to organize them (I suggest a fishing tackle box).
The map is made out of solid cardboard squares, which I found to be very usable and I felt like they could take a little bit of abuse.
The tokens are punched out from the same cardboard as the map squares.
There are some plastic pieces, one of mine was malformed (a casualty of mass production).  I feel like the flag pieces could break fairly easily.

Gameplay:
The first game I played, which was a 1v1, took about 2 hours.  The rulebook suggest playing the first game with the goal of building three cities to win.  I encourage everyone to do the same.
The second game I played, was with the 4 player map, and it took us 7 hours to play (2 of us had played before the other 2 had not).  Granted my friends and I are very particular of the rules and would often go back to read them very often.  I think it would have gone faster if we didn't argue over the rules so much.  In my view some of the rules are a bit ambiguous, which caused the delay for us.
The last few play-throughs were 4 player and they only took about 3.5-4 hours.

As for the actual gameplay, all paths to victory are viable.  In more than one game, multiple players were very close to victory using different paths.",4.0
"this is a great game if you like civilizations, politics, art, buildings. it is really fun to leader a civilization and keep ahead of your rivals as you progress throug history and time. BUT BEWARE it is time consuming, you need at least 5 hours just to set the board and understand the rules for the first time (not kidding) but when you get it, it is really fun, it takes about 3 to 4 hours to play a game but you will feal it like 30 min i promise. in conclusion it is a great game if you focus on it and don't get intimidated by the size of the rulebook and the number of piezes.",4.0

"This is an amazing expansion to the already amazing LOTR game. It features a new obstacle, The Nazgul, that further make the journey more exciting for the Fellowship. Instead of a die roll controlling Sauron's choices, one may play the Dark Lord. This game provides with instructions to show when Sauron takes his turn (at the beginning of every player's turn and instead of die rolls, and what he can do. Sauron now controlls the Nine and if they reach the hobbits and reports back to Mordor the game is over. Sauron also has his own deck of cards to make even more bad events occur. 4 more Sauron tiles are used and 23 evil black tiles may be added. Also, a new Gandalf card is provided, and a replacement Gandalf card for Foresight, because tiles are now drawn out of a Sauron bag. This is truly a worth-while expansion to the LOTR board game.",4.0
"This game is great at three players and better with six. The game is broken with four players, and somewhat broken at five players. I was told on Boardgamegeek.com that their is an expansion to fix it, but I'm not going to get it.

"Unfortunately the rules for this game are a little vague in the actual rulebook, but after a quick video search of an actual game, me and my friends got it down very quickly.  Once you learn how things work (which is more simple than we originally imagined), it's very fast paced and very fun.",4.0
"Eight combatants will start the first round.  One will be eliminated each round, until in the end only 3 remain.  Each round you have the opportunity to place a bet on one or more who you think will endure.  Each one has a special ability that can help you or cripple your opponent, but you can only use these abilities if you have the most points wagered on those contestants.  Contestants that are eliminated score no points for players, and the player with the most points at the end wins.  Simple concept: yes.  Simple strategy: no.

Each turn you have to decide if you will play a card to help a creature YOU want to prevail or to take out a creature that an opponent is backing.  A tough enough choice with just 2 players, but with more players it becomes even more complicated deciding WHO you want to take out, especially since some players will have bet on the same contestants as you did in successive rounds.  Temporary alliances form, but in the end everybody wants to come out on top.

Each creature has a card numbered 0-10 that reflects their combat value for that round.  You can play these cards on top of each other, so you don't want to smugly throw that 10 on the Gorgon you're betting on in the first round, because your opponent can throw a zero on top of it at any time, and it's goodbye Gorgon and your points with it.  Plus you have ""Spectator"" cards that show unique creatures numbered 0-10.  These act like ""wild"" cards that can be played on top of any combatants still in the fight.  They can either bail you out or hurt your opponent, and additionally they void a creature's special ability if one is played on top of them.

There is some luck involved because you're drawing cards every turn, but you always have 8 of them.  Thus strategy plays a much greater role in winning the game, and new players will probably lose the first time until they get past the learning curve, but it only takes one full game to figure out the strategy, and then it's a real challenge.  The mechanics of this game could easily be transposed into a mafia theme, or any other type where elimination is the ultimate endgame, so it's not what I'd consider deep in that department, but the artwork is good and the colors are bright.  The cards are coated, which makes them shuffle well and durable too.  The portable size of this game makes it a great choice to stick in your glove box or backpack.  Share this one with your friends.  Highly recommended.",4.0
"This game plays very similarly to how I imagined it, but the biggest hindrance toward actually getting a game going is understanding the rulebook.

"So I'm a board game fanatic and I was expecting this to be one of the more complicated games in my collection. To my pleasant surprise the rules are actually very easy to grasp. That's not to say it's the easiest game to pick up and learn, but it's not as intimidating as it first appears. There are tons of tutorials online so I'll spare you an explanation and just get straight to the point.

The game does a pretty good job of creating the atmosphere of the song of ice and fire series. as far as political conspiring and betrayal. However, the majority of the game is based on military conquest. If you like a good war strategy game this has several unique features which really separate it from other war games on the market, making it a unique game for your shelf.",4.0

"this game is a fun role play game. without too much strategy. There is a little bit. But a lot of luck (dice rolling). IT reminds me of dungeons and dragons- but on a game board. IT takes a long time to play over 2 hours normally. BUt it's really easy to learn and play. It's kinds like a combination of monopoly, sorry, and ungle wiggly. What do I mean by that? well- remember uncle wiggly - when you got to read all the cards to move..in this game you draw cards to determine what is happening to your character - sorry- b/c really there was no straetegy really- you drew a card and moved that number... you roll dice to move your character. and monopoply- b/c you go all around the board.

Of course there is much more to this game- unlike monopoply where your character (shoe or car etc) didn't matter in this game your character has certain special abilities that determine how you will play the game. (so yes there is some strategy) but not like when you are playing catan, or dominion, or civilizations!

Over all its a fun long game that is easy on the brain. I'm a former D&D geek from years past and this is a fun way to ""relive"" so of those glory days of urky my fighter dwarf! yes I still remember my characters name- he was that good! ;-)

"I would otherwise give this board game five stars. It's a lot of fun, has quite a bit of replayability, is fantastically complex, and is one of the more balanced board games I've ever played. The only problem is that there are quite a few small pieces, and this does not come with containers for them all.

If you want to play this game (which I recommend you do) make sure you've got at least six small baggies for each of the houses.",4.0
"This game is similar to risk, but they managed to successfully throw in some elements that allow players to ally or screw over other players. Any fan of the HBO show will enjoy learning more of the geography of Westeros, but will probably only know who half of the characters on the player cards for each house, while readers of the books will be delighted to see some favorites show up in the game. Takes about an hour per player and you need at least 3 to play.

THAT BEIND SAID, you have to allow at least an hour of rules explanation to first time players, and this can be the games fault. The average gamer tends to get bored and lose interest before we can even start playing the game.

You can eventually change the rules as needed, but start by playing a few games the correct way so that you can get an idea of what the actual way to resolve things are.

"Fantastic game

Me and a group of friends (5 of us) are beginner role players. Had a great time our first play through of talisman. Only issue is the length of the game. We played 6 days in a row for 2 hours a day and still hadn't made it to the interior ring. If you have the time though, it is absolutely worth it.",4.0
Talisman is necessary for every gamer's shelf/closet/basement. It is a classic game and full of random fun and frustration.,4.0
Fun game but long and you need like four+ for a good game,4.0
"Aside from being fairly complex, which makes sense if you know anything about GoT, the only major issue I had was the requirement for 3 players. Most games only require 2 and me and my wife live a bit out of the way for our friends to come visit. Eventually though one of my friends bought the game as well and now we have people sitting out or teaming up under one house just to play. The game is a good mix between the Civilization computer games, and classic Risk. You obviously want more of the map to be under you, but you can do more than just attack and defend. The wildlings feature adds a good bit of randomness to the game as well, that can throw off all your plans or help them. So always keep that in the back of your mind and remember that no matter what alliances you have formed, there is only ONE Iron Throne.",4.0
"This game is a ton of fun.  Especially when you see the panicked face on your ally when you flip over the orders.

My biggest problem with the game is that the ramp up period to learn how to play is a very long time.  There are a ton of game mechanics and it requires a lot of time to teach to new players.  If you game with the same people regularly, then this might be a good fit; however, if you game sporadically without a set group of people (like myself), then it might be wise to pass on this one.",4.0
"I got this for my family for Christmas. The kids love it. My darling thinks that the game play is based too much on luck because of all the dice rolls. But I've played far more games than she has and I think this criticism is a little unfair. I'd not played Talisman for 25+ years, and I remember is being more complex and interesting than this latest edition, but that could be the rosy tint of nostalgia interfering with accuracy. I've played it a few times with the kids since we got it and it is a good game, entertaining and interesting.",4.0
"First Impressions, a positive review

Visual Appeal - 9/10
The components of this game are beautifully designed.  Every component has detailed artwork that does not disappoint.  The player mats are a bit flimsy and the game uses the standard colored cubes for resources.

Rules Clarity - 9/10
The rulebook is filled with photos and examples to aid in understanding.  Constantinopolis comes with one of the best-writted rulebooks I've seen.  The rules are extensive, though, and you may have trouble finding a specific rule if you need to look something up during gameplay.

Gameplay - 7/10
Every player essentially goes broke in the first turn.  The obvious strategy at the beginning is to purchase buildings that allow you to produce more goods.  Beyond that, there are a couple of options you can play:
 - You can establish a market trade engine so that you activate your buildings to sell goods and earn points,
 - You can buy ships so that you can always ship your goods and earn all the points and money from your commerce cards,
 - You can purchase Wall segments to earn in-game bonuses and end-game points,
 - Or you can do any combination of the above.
Every strategy will work, but only one person will win!

The only luck involved comes with the commerce cards you draw.  If you receive commerce cards that match your resources, you'll earn more points and more money, which will let you buy more resource production.  The luck fades out into strategy later in the game as you purchase the buildings and ships needed to fulfill your commerce contracts no matter what you're dealt.

Player Interaction - 6/10
Constantinopolis has minimal player interaction.  The first phase of each turn is an Auction for public office in which players bid for turn order and turn ability.  After that, the player acting as Consul may interrupt your building purchases during the Construction phase or another player may purchase the last ship that you needed during the Accept Contracts phase.  The limited supply on buildings and ships is the only way to hinder your opponents' strategies, so not much cut-through action here.

Replay Value - 7/10
Within the last two turns of the game I was starting to feel that the game had gone on long enough.  I played with experienced players and our game took us about 2.5 hours to complete.  I don't foresee strategy changing much from game to game.  You may buy buildings in a different order, but not much is going to change.

Distinction - 6/10
While this game is fun, there are plenty of games that are very similar.  The games Cuba and Puerto Rico, for example, have almost all of the same game mechanics.  In terms of uniqueness, this game may be more familiar than foreign to first-time players.

Scoring - 8/10
The scores remained quite low for the first half of the game until everyone was producing the resources needed to start mass shipments of goods.  Each contract can earn you 1, 2, or 3 points depending on how you ship your goods.  The shipping mechanic is very well conceived in my opinion.  You will ask yourself if you want the quick points and money or if you should wait an additional turn to gain an additional point or two.

RATING: 7.4

I definitely recommend this game!",4.0
"Old geek from the 80s, loved it then, love it now.

So far I purchased the City, Dungeon, and Reaper expansions and will buy more.

Make sure you have friends that will play a game like this as it takes some time to play... sometimes 3+ hours etc.",4.0
"The product is a well thought one. Considering the rules and fun we had with my friends, it was awesome. The map is a little bit crowded and might weary your eyes after a while, but that's acceptable. It's a bit pricey but that's acceptable too I guess.

If you like games that require thought and planning, That's a good game and there is nearly nothing random in it. The setup is such that, you nearly have to do what happens in the book. If you like strategy and diplomacy games it's definitely a good board game. It's sure that you will have lots of fun.",4.0
"We added it to our monthly gaming days and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I was not as thrilled, but the other players really dug it.  It just may not be my cup of tea.  I am more enthusiastic about Tomb, Battlestar Galactica, Talisman, etc. But there are no problems with the game, per se.  I think after watching the TV show and reading the books that GRR Martin's world is more about personal relationships than pure warfare.  Warfare is really what this game is about.  And screwing over your opponents.  Which I suppose is true to the show, but it seems more abstract than personal here.",4.0
"It's a great game, very fun, with calamity and craziness growing the further along in the game that you go. Be careful though, because the game board itself is somewhat cheap, and when a friend accidentally spilled a drink onto it, I tried to wipe it up quickly and some of the paint came off the board, which was annoying.",4.0
"I absolutely love this game. It's a great co-op game that leaves you struggling to the very end. While the small board and box add to it thematically, I think the second printing came in a bigger box, and would likely be better.",4.0
"I received this game as a Christmas gift, and somehow did not play it for a whole nine months. I'm glad I did, though; it's a riot! The theme is quirky and fun (drunk gnomes on a submarine!), and the gameplay is pretty quick, once you get the hang of how to use the time counters. There is a significant amount of randomness in the events (Eurogamers, beware!), but this is fitting with the theme. The fact that it is a cooperative game that scales up to eight players is great.

So, the story is that you are a bunch of Gnomes on a doomed submarine, the Red November. You are being pursued by the Kraken and everything is failing. The crew will be rescued when 60 minutes passes, but you have to work together to survive that long. Each player tries to avert disasters by attempting repairs or other actions, which take time. Gameplay passes, not in a typical clockwise fashion, but to the player whose gnome's time counter is furthest back on the time track. The designers really do an excellent job of making you feel you are working against the clock.

In short, the game is great. I highly recommend this if you are in the mood for a light, fast and chaotic good time.",4.0
"To be enjoyable the game needs at least 5 players, so it's is hard for me to find enough people to play with. Also the rules a a little complicated (for someone who does not play boardgames on a regular basis) and sometimes it's tedious to teach people the rules. Otherwise great game!",4.0
"First off, Talisman isn't for folk who spend hours playing Mage Knight or travelling to lands afar with a piece of pen and paper around an rpg table with their mates. Talisman is for their friends who sort of know what games are, know there's more out there than Monopoly but don't really know how to get into them.

Talisman is, IMO, a great gateway game. The roll-to-move aspect of every board game non-gamers have ever played is there so there's no need for panic about how-where-if to move around; roll and move, simple. Also, there's an end in sight! ""We're trying to get around the board and into the middle, where the first one there will try to kill the rest of us"" - again, simple enough. But there's also enough ""new and exciting"" to make a game of Talisman with non-hobby-gamers, well, new and exciting! ""Yep, that's a bear. Now you have to kill it. Roll a die"" or ""oh cool, a sword! So now you're a bit more powerful in battles..."" - it's ""fantasy babble"" enough to make newbies feel included in your odd hobby, without scaring them off. Also, they don't have to worry about you being ""better at games"" than them, since this is almost 100% luck - if you win, you're lucky not wonderful. There's no such thing as ""good at Talisman""!

But most of all, it's a great game to waste time over. There's enough to think about to hold interest but enough to not have to worry about to be able to chat and drink over the board.

My advice? Gamer or not, invest in this fantasy epic*, but some beer! some snack! invite some of your more open-minded mates over and spend three hours fighting orcs and dragons and getting tipsy.

Talisman is perfect. A simple, accessible and, more importantly, FUN fantasy quest board game to lure your muggle-mates into your weird, wood-filled world.",4.0
game is a lot of fun and pretty easy to learn my family picked it up in a couple rounds no problem,4.0
"Ordered this through Amazon and the vendor they used to distribute this shipped in 2-3 days, gotta love good service.

Its a board game, takes a little too long to play at times but I am wondering if the expansions add a little more to do in the game.

I played Talisman as a kid and enjoyed it, my kids like it now though its hard to compete with the short term attention spans that are generated by competition with Playstation and XBox.",4.0
"This is a good game when you modify the rules to allow game play considerably faster.  But there are some issues.
1) no chance of cooperative play unless you completely change the game.
2) The construction of the board was poorly done.  just a few times of use and the graphic of the board was creasing to where the map started to disappear.  not good, I expected a lot better, considering I still have board games from 30 years ago that were used repeatedly and they are not faded in the crease.

I look forward to them creating a cooperative play scenario soon, hopefully.",4.0
"A crisis management game with a fantasy/russian theme.  Red November (RN) is a cooperative survival board game, where players must work together to survive/win.  The rules are simple, and the quality of the pieces, cards, and board being top notch as one would expect from Fantasy Flight.  As the game unfolds, players are confronted with mounting challenges and deadlines that need to be overcome or risk losing the game.  Some aspects of this game can be frustrating as the difficulty can change from game to game depending on the player count and the randomness of the event cards drawn.  Play time of up to 2 hours with 6 to 8 players is common.

A few points of criticism...

1.  As crisis management games go, there are better products out there.  ex - Pandemic
2.  The game starts without any problems, leading players to wonder what to do initially.  This might work to create some faux tension, but it ultimately stalls the game from the start.
3.  The event cards generate all sorts of chaos, but they feel too repetitive.  ex - despite a good shuffle, 7 barricaded doors in just 2 player turns is a bit boring.

Despite all that, its a good game, and worth the price tag.  Just make sure your expectations are in line with what this game is.",4.0

"This game is fun for groups to play, especially competitive groups.  Since this is a cooperative game, you have to work together.  I have found that if you play with 6 players, it's pretty easy to win.  If you are playing with only a few, then it's nearly impossible to win.",4.0
"A great board game - creates a sense of frantic panic. Really wonderful as it promotes strong teamwork and communication. Takes a bit to learn, but suprisingly simple to play once you learn the rules. Game box was shipped slightly torn, but all the parts are in prefect condition. Shipped very fast.",4.0
"I used to play pen and paper table tops often and never really got the chance to play tabletop board games since my family was mostly monopoly and clue sort of people.

Talisman is a good intro for those who haven't table topped before.  It gives you just enough immersion and variety to keep new player's interest for the entire game.

For veterans of table topping the game might come off as a bit one or two dimensional with not much to offer like other more intensified games about fantasy and board crawling (like Descent).

None the less it's a fun family game that I have gotten my little brothers (15/16) and mother into.

I myself prefer worker placement and dungeon diving games more than this.",4.0
"I recently ordered this game.  It was the first time I had played it, I did not play any of the earlier editions.  The game is a lot of fun, and has a good amount of variety.  I really only have one problem with the gameplay, but there is an easy fix.  The problem we found is that it starts off extremely slow.  Gold is hard to come by in the game, and builds up slowly.  This slows game play down in the beginning.  We have had games where the first hour drags by as players try to accumulate gold.  So we simply instituted a house rule that players start the game with 6 gold.  Some of the characters start with more gold (the merchant, for example) and those characters get 6 in addtion to whatever they start with normally.  This gives players money to buy items to buff their character, or  ""seed money"" that they can invest in things like Wanted Posters (if you have the City Expansion, which I HIGHLY reccomend) to get even more money.  This is just how we speeded up the play in the beginning.  The City Expansion provides shops to buy items you can't get anywhere else, as well as providing a few ways to get money a little quicker.  It is a great addition to the game as well.",4.0
"Red November is a light, co-op strategy game with a few really cool features.  RN features a different sort of turn order mechanic in which players pay time (turns) in attempts to successfully fix part of the decrepit sub. More time paid increases their likelihood of success. So you can do a half-assed job of a lot of things, or do one thing really well. It's a cool idea (although it would be more interesting if there were more options than just success of failure).

The theme of the game is fun, and doesn't feel excessively heavy. The gameplay time is fairly short (30-45 minutes). When your gnome dies it doesn't feel like a huge deal since you can still advise others on how they ought to take their turn. And there is even an option to just abandon your friends on the ship and quit playing (If you do the game flips from co-op to competitive, and you win if they all perish. Also, you can go get a Coke and say demoralizing things while they struggle.)

This game that somehow misses the mark on really fun gameplay.  Possibly because there are too many bits and pieces, or maybe because everything is so small--neither the small cardboard item tokens nor the board are quite big enough--I felt highly focused and yet still a little overwhelmed playing RN. There could be half as many items, they ought to be printed on cards instead of being .5 x .5 inch squares, and the dice-rolling could be echewed entirely by printing dice-numbers on the disaster cards you draw each turn.  I often found myself looking the bits-and-pieces up on the cheat-sheet a lot and not making much eye contact with other players.  For a game that is supposed to be cooperative, this strikes me as a drawback.  I hear there is an edition with a larger board. I'd recommend it if you can find it.

All in all the game has a really interesting idea, and it's fun for a few plays. It isn't going to be your next group favorite, but it's so close that it might be worth it to hack a little, make-up/fill in some rules, and present your friends with a v2.0 (""Red December""?).",4.0
"If you love the books/HBO series then you will like the game.  That being said I really dig complex strategy games and aGoT is definitely up there in terms of complexity.  You'll need a crew of people who are invested in mythology of Westeros and will have 3 hours to spend on a somewhat frequent basis to enjoy this to the fullest.

It will take a couple of playthroughs to really get the hang of it, then reread the rule book as there will be a number of things you'll still be doing wrong.

Cracked has a hilarious spoof on this that isn't far off.  Also, Fantasy Flight Games has a 15 min video that does a really nice job of explaining the basics.",4.0
"Game is amazing, great art on cards and board. Only one disappointmet was box itself, everything is just thrown into one space without anything that could keep things from mixing with each other. But its no big deal, you can make em yourself/live without. Great choice for everyone who loves strategy games ;)",4.0
"This is a very good game.  Shows critical thought in numbers (tracking and calculating), social interaction, resources management and negotiations.",4.0
"I like this game, it is a good concept and after reading the 30 pages of rules makes logical sense. The issue is that there's 30 pages of rules, a great deal of mechanics every player has to learn (most are unwilling to read the rulebook), and most aspects have important qualifiers that you need to understand.

This makes for a semi realistic feel where you have to strategize and plan how to allocate resources, move units, prepare for other player's decisions. I personally enjoy the depth but cannot find other people willing to sink 2 hours into learning the rules and then 6 hours into a game. My brother convinced me to buy it and said he knew people to play with. We played one night, where he and I spent most of the time explaining how to play and got through 4 rounds before people had to go to sleep. His friends didn't want to finish and this was just a HUGE waste of money in reality. It's a fun concept but people aren't into tabletop gaming like this anymore :(

The issues:
3 phases to each turn
within phases you rotate around resolving one order at a time (every territory will have an order, takes a long ass time)
too many mechanics that have a chance of popping up (i.e. wildling attacks, supply determination, mustering troops) all dependent on continuously shifting aspects of the game
slightly confusing unit abilities. for instance ships, sea transport, naval battles, and how ports connect to territories is all quite unclear in the rulebook (should just say ships can only attack other ships, are used as bridges for land units to attack far away territories, can be docked to consolidate power at a port but not attack, and can never attack land; rulebook has it scattered in blurbs on different pages)

The fun:
rewarding to outsmart your opponents with orders, you can thwart their plans with raids and give support from adjacent lands to turn the tide
battle system is dynamic, based on unit strength, fiefdom track status, and hero cards with bonuses. you can get allies to help you out and don't always lose your army when you lose a battle (especially since it's hard to amass big armies)
fun heros, good houses with nice balancing in a 6-player game (tyrell might be in the middle a bit much but they should be)
good map-- pretty accurate with how the novels are, especially with distribution of resources, rivers and bridges, strongholds, accessibility, etc.

Overall: if you have a good gaming group and won't have to explain a billion rules to people that aren't 100% on board you will have a lot of fun. the real issue is that people lack the patience to enjoy this game and some things might be unnecessarily complex. you could argue that the complexity adds replay value, but when you don't finish one game even there's a loss of playability. most people will be drawn in by the relation to SoIF series but after getting into it, gameplay is the biggest concern. at $60 this game is VERY expensive! everything is just cardboard and plastic; they don't even punch stuff out or give you bags to store the dozens of pieces for each of the 6 houses. I really wish it were possible to get people to play a full game of this because I would love it, but good luck with that. You need at least 4 people to have a good time with the game.",4.0

"A Board games based upon the popular and excellent book series.

The game is a lot of fun, it is not a quick play, a game may last a few hours so if you have the patients it is a lot of fun.

My problems with it come from how complicated it is. It took two hours for the four of us to work out how to play that is a long long time.

My other problem is there is so many pieces and nothing to do with them after talking them out of the original package. I had to buy re seal able bags as a way to keep track.

Overall if your a fan of the books or tv show and have the patients to learn how to play i totally suggest buying it. If you are looking for a casual play look somewhere else",4.0

"We've played only once so far and enjoyed it. Lots of rules, but a quick skim and diving straight into a game worked for us. Took us about 4.5 hours to play with 6 players, all of us new to the game.

Perhaps playing additional games will illuminate specific strategies for each House.",4.0

"""Twilight Imperium: Rex"" by Fantasy Flight Games is a wonderful science-fiction themed game set in the Twilight Imperium Universe.  Up to six players vie for control of Mecatol Rex, the capital city of the declining Lazax Empire.  What's cool here is that each of the races competing for control has unique advantages.  The Xxcha can make predictions about the game, the Federation of Sol knows where the bombarding human fleet will travel to next, the Hacan get money every time anyone deploys troops, etc...  The battle engine is a lot fun, where each side has to commit a set number of troops while adding an officer with an additional combat rating.  Each side is able to pick a traitor, which they can use against one enemy in battle.  This traitor mechanic adds a fun level of paranoia to the game that delivers a unique degree of tension.  The only real complaint is the Hacan advantage seems a little strong, and might lead to some balancing issues with repeated play.  Based on the original ""Dune"" mechanic, this game is a fun game that will provide hours of entertainment.",4.0
"We have enjoyed playing the game, Rex, and we had played an older version, the Dune board game, and found them to be similar enough to get into it right away.  The playing pieces are very nice, the board is gorgeous, and the factions are both challenging and fun to play.  We also have Twilight Imperium, and we found the quality of the Rex game to be the same sturdy construction.  We intend to use some of the Rex pieces when playing the Dune boardgame, since that game was available only as a pdf you had to print yourself.  But we have played it quite a bit, and shared it with family members, too.  Very Good.",4.0
"After growing bored of Computer Games, I decided to go back to my roots. . . kind of. I used to be a pen and paper RPG'er back in the day. But i don't have the time for that now days being in my 40's with a wife and kids. So, i decided to try out these board games. Talisman is a great one! To my surprise, my kids love it as well!

We have had a lot of fun with this game so far and this has led me to purchase the Dungeon and Reaper expansions. Highly;y recommend this game!",4.0
"I bought this game about a month ago. After playing it twice (and not finishing), My son and I took it out  for a third go about 2 weeks ago. The board fell apart in our hands. I was there, I barely applied any pressure and it just disintegrated at the seams.

Okay, disappointing. So I write fantasy flight, explain my problem. I got an email today that a new board is being shipped!!!

I think there are a lot of reviews talking about the ups and downs about this game, but I just wanted to let people know that I had a no hassle experience getting my board replaced (I don't actually have the board yet, but got shipping confirmation).

Thanks Fantasy flight!

"I just received the game for Christmas and I am a bit fantasy/role-playing fan.  This is a fun game, but I was a little disappointed because it is heavy on luck and light on strategy.  The process is fun though and the art is beautiful.  I particularly like the archaic looking dice, I will use them in other games probably.  A good one to try if you just got to have a fantasy fix!",4.0
"After buying this game, I did a lot of looking on the web for what things could be done with it. By the time the box arrived I had a wish list a mile long! I enjoy the fantasy element of this and so do the members of my family. My 5 year old is always wanting to slay monsters and this is a good way to do it. He has the basics of the game pretty well in hand as he only has to count the pips on the dice to figure out whether he can move to the spaces he likes (Farms seem to draw him in), or if the dice allowed him to slay the monster. My daughter enjoys any time a toad gets on the board and laughs hysterically about my misfortune. I have already been asked to get an expansion or all of them and will probably be doing that before to long. This is a great way to hang with my family instead of just waiting for the next controller to be available on the video games. It makes an excellent way to help my kindergartner learn some math and start to read as well as my older daughters have to work out some plans for how to get from here to there with several forks in the road!

I recommend games like this to everyone even if it is monopoly or dominoes because you can communicate on a level that video games just can't reach.",4.0
"If you are into boardgames and want one with a High Fantasy theme that is still whimsical enough not to put off those who aren't Fantasy enthusiasts, then this is the one. Not utterly silly but not serious at all, this one presents a night of fun for those inside and outside of Fantasy fandom. It's pricey, no doubt, but if the above is your need or want or a niche to fill in your boardgame diet, you will find it worth the bucks. But...

Be picky and choosey when it comes time to add some of the present and future expansions. Not all are to everyone's tastes, and some will go beyond what your non-Fantasy family and friends are going to want. And some dilute the core game too much.  Oh, and be prepared to have a fair amount of space to lay this one out.  Over the years (and editions), this game has actually gotten rather big... to big... board-wise.",4.0
I played this as a kid and am now playing it with my kid. It's just wonderful. My only gripe would be that I think the artwork in the second edition was better than this one's.,4.0
"I played (I believe) the second edition as a kid.  This edition, in my opinion, is better.  Here's what I found:

Pros:
+ Real pieces (characters, gold, lives, etc.) that are durable.
+ When you reach the end the game is over, no possibility that the game can keep going b/c a dragon killed off that character and everyone else has a chance to win.
+ Game board is more solid and the artwork has been somewhat improved.
+ I like the characters more from this edition.  They have more attributes that make game play better.
+ Fate tokens.  You can roll the die again if you want to.

Cons:
- Adventure cards are too small.  They seem like they got left in the dryer.
- The board is a little big, so you better not play on a TV tray.
- The board is still the same as the original.  I was hoping they might ""improve"" things just a little.

This game is still a blast to play, and I was able to get my wife (who doesn't really like fantasy stuff) to play.  I would definitely buy it again.  Well worth the money.",4.0
"Have purchased this great game for about 2 weeks and my family really enjoyed it. It bring us together and have a great time. also bought expansion for dungeon and highland. the game itself without expansion will be boring after a while, the expansion make the game last longer and for those who like to build up the character, it is really a great game. recommended for all.",4.0
"We bought this game as a birthday present for our son who just turned 11.  He really enjoyed playing the game.  This game says it's for ages 9 and above but I really don't think he would've had the patience for this game before now (because of all the details).  And this is NOT a 90 minute game.  This is a multi-hour game.  It also takes a couple of hours to read through and understand all the rules and ins and outs of the game.

We don't regret buying the game but I'm also not sure we would've bought it had we known how long of a game it is to actually play it (in real time).  There are rules of how to play a shorter game inside the rule book which we haven't gotten to yet - so that may be really helpful to cut back the time.  We had 5 people playing and it took us 6 hours to complete!

I did have a really good time with it - it held my interest as well as the other adults playing.  But this may be a more suited game for adults or young adults - our son had trouble staying focused and tuned in to what was going on during the game (he played for 3 hours before it was his bedtime).

I also didn't like the fact that it is for kids and there is a tavern space on the board that has options on it that correspond with dice roles with things like: get drunk and passed out lose a turn and get tippsy and hit a farmer and things like that.  I think that is inappropriate.  I'm also not a huge fan of there being a huge breasted character with a tiny waist.  Things like that put certain ideals into kids's minds as being acceptable and even funny (with the drunk actions in the tavern) and relating them to actions that are misperceptions and dangerous.  I feel that every little thing matters with the development of a kids personality and thoughts.  This is not an educational game of any kind, which is just fine - but just so people know for their own kids, if you are wanting that in this game you will not really find it.

I would recommend this game - for older kids or adults.  Just prepare in advance for a long game :)",4.0
"This expansion really makes the game more enjoyable. The default game is neat, but is rather limited in it's scope. All the new additions make this game really shine. Well worth the buy and a must have.",4.0
"The base game  is a very fun game, but it dosen't reach it's full potential without this expansin. A lot more building options, and strategy variants. A must have, if you like the base game.",4.0
"The expansion provides more building options than the base game.  Nothing special but it is more variety.  The expansion also provides more predictable military planning than the base game.  Greatly reduces the frustration and randomness in surviving the barbarian hordes.  That's the primary reason I was attracted to expansion.  The expansion also provides profession bonus cards for each player.  These cards are not well balanced and some are much, much more powerful than others.  I generally don't play with them unless I'm playing against someone isn't as skilled and a handicap is needed.",4.0
"To Forge a Realm has the unenviable task of taking a mediocre game and turning it into something great.  The bad news is that it falls short of achieving greatness.  The GOOD news is that it does transform the game from a two-dimensional, uninvolving exercise in unexceptionalism  and breathes much needed life into it, making it a lot more palatable.

  I had played (and enjoyed) Kingsburg once before buying the base game.  What I didn't realize was that the version I played included many of the items in ""To Forge a Realm"".  Needless to say, I was quite disappointed that the base game did not include these components.  A nice feature is that each of the facets of this expansion are independent, and can be included (or left out) as you see fit.

Enlarged player sheets - The original sheets had 20 buildings, these contain an extra two rows, so they have 28 buildings.  The bottom line is that instead of only having 5 possible buildings to choose to build, there are now 7 possibilities.  That's a big step in the right direction.

Replacement Rows - Used in conjunction with the enlarged sheets, you may blindly take one or two of these rows and place them over the rows on your sheet.  Not only does this vary the buildings that are available, but each player's sheet is no longer identical to all the others.

Deck of Governor cards - Allows each player to play as a different character, each with different benefits.  Some people also call this their `personal advisor'.  Either way, this once again gives individuality to each player (which was sorely needed)!

Event Deck - This deck of cards is shuffled and at the beginning of each year a new card is turned over with instructions that pertain only to the coming year.  These cards affect all players.  Some cards are pleasant, some are not, but it adds another small dimension to the game.

Reinforcement tokens (one set per player), each year, instead of the King's reinforcements being determined by a die roll, players can choose one of six tokens requesting a number of reinforcements,  Each token may be used only once.  One token will remain at the end of the game, which gets added to the players score.

  Of these components, I ALWAYS use the enlarged sheets, USUALLY use the two decks and the replacement rows (I won't use them when teaching new players), and JUST STARTED using the reinforcement tokens (for some reason I didn't think the reinforcements would help the game very much, but I actually enjoy them a lot).

  My advice is that if you have Kingsburg already, this expansion is a must-have.  I don't think Kingsburg would ever hit my table these days if I didn't have this.  If you haven't gotten Kingsburg yet, realize that it's possible that  at some point, you'll be faced with the decision to either buy the ""To Forge a Realm"" expansion or let the base game gather dust on your game shelf.",4.0
"""To Forge A Realm"" is pretty typical of other expansions, in that it gives you new tokens and cards that you can either swap out or mix in with the original game components.  Sometimes this doesn't really make for a new gaming experience or strategy, but does bring some novelty to a game you've already played several times (and probably enjoy, otherwise there's no sense in buying an expansion).

There's a little of both with this one:

-Soldier Tokens definitely make the winter battles more significant, so you have to alter strategy a bit from the normal rules to avoid losing buildings or victory points.  I think this is good, and I really like the addition.

-New building sheets offer more variety, but don't really change the strategy if everyone is using the same sheets.

-New building layover strips are GREAT, with or without the new building sheets, because now players have options for buildings not available to other players, which provides different ways to win.

-Governor Cards offer a great deal of variety to many facets of the game, and they seem well balanced after several plays.  In one game, I took a Noble to start the game with 6 victory points, but still ended up losing to a player whose Miner gave an extra gold at the end of each productive season.

-Event Cards affect everyone the same way, so I didn't find these as enjoyable as other elements of this expansion that are unique to individual players.

Since each of these additions are modular, you can use only the ones you like.  Even though I really only like 3 of the 5, Kingsburg is one of my favorite games, and if you enjoy it too, then I recommend you pick up ""To Forge A Realm"" as well.",4.0
"Kingsburg is not the most complicated of boardgames out there.  Many hardcore gamers may quickly tire of it because the heavy dice mechanic adds a lot of chance.  If so, than ""To Forge a Realm"" isn't going to help you much there.  It just gives you more choices and throws some more randomness into the mix.  Though for people who enjoy the original game, this is what makes To Forge a Realm really worthwhile.  One of Kingsburg's problems is that there aren't many different building options, so repeated games can get very repetitive.  This expansion makes each player's situation more unique.",4.0
"""Battles of Westeros"" from Fantasy Flight Games is a fun tactical war game set in the universe of George R. R. Martin's ""A Game of Thrones.""  The game allows players to recreate epic battles from the Martin series, and manages to deliver its fun and immersive theme even as it offers a fun and highly playable wargame.  Hex tiles are laid over the game board to create the geography of the scenario, and each side places its units.  Die rolls of certain symbols allow units to be moved, which is a standard of the Battlelore series.  It's fun but also frustrating.  Maneuvering units into position can count for little without the proper die roll.  Combat is pretty straight forward and generally intense, leading to a lot of post-game discussions on what might have been.  When all is said and done ""Battles of Westeros"" is not the best tactical combat game out there, but if you like the theme and enjoy a game with depth as well as playability, you could do a lot worse.",4.0
"Players: 2-6
Learning Curve: Very High
Setup Time: 30-45 minutes
Play Time: 2-5 hours

I had just got back from BlizzCon '08 and decided to make this purchase through Amazon.  The game here is much lower than retail and lower than it was sold at their convention ($80)!  Game has a *very* high learning curve, as it took myself and some friends well over an hour just to get a good idea of how a single turn played out.  :o  Aside from that, it is a very nice game.

I think it's also good to note that Fantasy Flight's customer service is amazing.  One of my air-unit pieces (Arbiter) was broken in two spots and I wasn't able to easily reglue it.  After calling Fantasy Flight, they quickly sent me new pieces of all the parts that were damaged, even those I felt looked okay after a little glue!  (A scourge, battlecruiser and arbiter pieces)

I would recommend getting storage containers or something of the sort for all the different pieces as the box provided does not have any means of organizing all your cards, tokens and figures provided.

While this game does take more time than playing ~3-5 games of actual Starcraft (as most of my friends will quickly point out), it is very well made and the creators spent a lot of time making a very authentic and unique board game.  For being such a big fan of the franchise, I had to get this product and would recommend any other fan of Starcraft or other Fantasy Flight games do the same!",4.0
"It's what you'd better be if you're going to play this. It comes complete with a 48pg. full color instruction book, which you will need and may in fact need to read more than once, especially if you're new to this style of board game. If you have trouble sitting through the short game of ""Monopoly"" this isn't for you. I'd be more willing to put it on a level with ""Risk"" as far as the amount of time you invest in it and the number of pieces, but there are no dice, and it takes a little getting accustomed to. Not a game you want to get the kid (or adult) with a short attention span). As long as you're willing to put the time and love into it, it's worth it. Just remember, it's not the PC game either fanboys but when the power's out and you need your ""Starcraft"" fix it's got enough friendly faces to get rid of the shakes. As far as my durability score goes, all of the unit pieces are made of a rubbery plastic, but as you may know a number of the units are flying creatures and in an attempt to be super cool looking, these units are mounted on a clear acrylic base. It does look super cool, however about seven (not really a lot considering there are 180 unit pieces) came to me snapped off of their pedestals. I was a bit disappointed, but with some super glue and a bit of patient matching (it's not just a board game it's also a puzzle. Bonus!) you can hardly tell now.",4.0
"So Fantasy Flight continues with its by now well stablished reputation of always releasing games with future expansions in mind. Sometimes it works, sometimes not.

In the case of Battlestar Galctica board game, thing are working, but beware: the combinations available to play the game, when you have the three sets at your table, are becoming out of hand. Initial loyalty set-up card is definitely a situation, you must read the rules carefully. The situation is so bad, that the rule book added a ""Frequented overlooked rules"" section.

As for ""feeling"" the TV show, the situation is gettin better. More characters are included, allies, new crisis, the Mark VII fighters, new skill cards with zero points, more options to role playing it a little bit...

With EXODUS, the weird thing is that you can play it without New Caprica. The rules for playing with the NEw Carpica expansion (Pegasus) are not so good. Also, the cylons are stronger now. The humans will indeed suffer more to win a game of BSG.

Overall this continues to be a very good game and a sure entertainment night.",4.0
"I was thrilled to get my copy of the Exodus expansion for the Battlestar Galactica board game (a.k.a. BSG) on December 30th. I think that the BSG board game is the best one out there currently and I frequently run games of it at local gaming conventions. The BSG game really captures the feel of the TV show and is accessible even to people who are not fans of the TV show. What Exodus does, besides adding lots of new characters and cards (and tokens!) to the basic game, is provide three new variants for BSG gameplay.

Honestly, though, I expected more from Exodus than what I got. Don't get me wrong--I think Exodus is great. But there are still a lot of pieces missing that would make this game a more complete experience. For example, I was expecting to get at least one new Cylon Leader, possibly D'Anna or Athena, and perhaps some new cards or rules for the New Caprica endgame.

If you've played BSG before, you might be surprised to learn that the Exodus expansion pretty much ignores the Pegasus expansion--or pretends that it never happened. The last page of the Exodus rulebook gives you helpful tips on combining the two expansions with the base game, but that effort seems half-hearted at best. Without Pegasus, you don't have the Battlestar Pegasus board, Admiral Cain, the three playable Cylon Leaders, Treachery cards, ""Reckless"" skill cards and the New Caprica board and endgame. Though I know a lot of people would rather leave New Caprica out altogether.

But let's focus on what Exodus does bring to the table.

1) New characters. There are four new characters in Exodus: Samuel T. Anders (pilot), ""Cally"" Tyrol (support), Felix Gaeta (military) and Tory Foster (political). Each one has new and interesting abilities and disadvantages. Cally will be popular because she can just execute someone at her location once per game. Gaeta can allow a re-roll of a bad FTL jump roll for any player. Anders can make one die roll per game be any result that he chooses. And Tory benefits by drawing skill cards (of any color) each time someone plays a Quorum card.

2) New skill cards, crisis cards, destination cards, Quorum cards, and Cylon super crisis cards. The new skill cards include zero strength skill cards that have triggered effects in skill checks (Establish Network, for example, doubles the strength of all Engineering cards in a skill check) and six strength cards that also have powerful texts (for example, Political Prowess is basically a get out of the Brig free card--it allows to you choose the result of any skill check started by a location). There are many new crisis and destination cards which follow from situations in season 3 of the TV show. Some of the crisis cards have extra effects triggered by some of the ""skill check effect"" skill cards. The Humans will be comforted to know that the new Cylon super crisis cards aren't overly abusive, and the Cylons should be pleased that the new Quorum cards aren't overly powerful.

3) The ""Conflicted Loyalties"" option. There are two new ""You Are A Cylon"" loyalty cards which can either add a Centurion to the boarding track or knock the Galactica jump track back two spaces. But the big news is that there are two new kinds of ""You Are Not A Cylon"" loyalty cards.
These two types of new loyalty cards make up the first of the three new variants for the game, the ""Conflicted Loyalties"" option. There are five ""The Final Five"" ""You Are Not A Cylon"" loyalty cards, all of which do bad things to the Humans if revealed. Yes, the Final Five are Cylons, but they're not necessarily allied with the Cylons that want to destroy Humanity. Despite that, the Five still don't like being revealed to the world and the consequences for outing them can be dire. This type of loyalty card makes the common practice of looking at another player's loyalty card from a crisis card or Baltar's once per game ability to be a new and dangerous risk.
The other new ""You Are Not A Cylon"" loyalty cards give ""Personal Goals"" to the Human players. Achieving these goals can make any Human look suspiciously like a Cylon, yet if the goals remain unfulfilled they cause resources to drop at the end of the game. An unfulfilled personal goal may turn a Human victory into a defeat.
Mainly, what these new loyalty cards do is give everyone something interesting to look at when loyalty cards are handed out. The player who looks at their loyalty card intently (or more than once) is no longer automatically a Cylon.

4) The ""Cylon Fleet"" option. A new secondary ""Cylon Fleet"" board with a Cylon basestar location at its center is the biggest addition to the game in Exodus. In the ""Cylon Fleet"" variant, all Cylon attack crisis cards are removed from the crisis deck. Instead, the Cylons mass their fleet outside of Galactica's space (on the secondary board) and their progress towards Galactica is measured on a ""Pursuit Track"" similiar to Galactica's jump track. Every Cylon activation icon on a crisis card adds more ships to the Cylon fleet board and advances the pursuit track towards an attack.
In this variant, the Cylons are ALWAYS doing something to get ready to attack Galactica and the civilian fleet. As an added bonus for the Cylons, a revealed Cylon player may move to the basestar location on the Cylon fleet board to create even more havoc.
The Cylon Fleet variant also brings in several new elements for the Humans. The new title of CAG (Commander of the Air Guard) gives pilots a leader who can perform extra actions on his turn. The CAG is also responsible for the placement of all civilian ships on the board...because in this variant no civilian ship can be placed in a space that already contains one (unless all space areas already contain civilian ships).
The new version of the Admiral title card now makes it so that nukes attack an entire area of space, not just a single ship. The Human pilots have the new option of ""escorting"" civilian ships off the board to prevent them from being easy prey for the Cylons. When the Cylons are not attacking--and even when they are--most of the pilots (and even the unmanned Vipers) will be busy escorting civilian ships off the board.
The four Mark VII Vipers (new in Exodus) used in this variant make that job easier. These advanced Vipers fly faster and are harder to damage. To balance that for the Cylons, a few extra Cylon raiders are included in Exodus.
If your Cylon Fleet games go anything like mine did, you'll have every Cylon ship on the board by the end of the game. Good hunting!

5) The ""Ionian Nebula"" option. This is the most complicated variant in Exodus, yet it's also the most interesting. There is a new ""Ionian Nebula"" objective card that leads to a new ""Crossroads"" endgame.
In this new endgame, a large Cylon fleet (the same size as the one the Humans faced leaving New Caprica) appears and is ready to fight, but before that fight occurs, all the players (both Cylon and Human) are judged. What constitutes said judgment are the new ""Trauma Tokens"" that come with Exodus and are the largest new element in this variant.
Each player starts the game with three trauma tokens (signifying the results of their struggles up to that point) and they want to have as few of them as possible when they reach the Crossroads phase at the end of the game.
There are three types of trauma tokens: benevolent (good for Humans, bad for Cylons), aggressive (good for Cylons, bad for Humans) and disaster (bad for everyone, usually resulting in an immediate execution). You keep what kind of tokens you have a secret (except the disaster ones, which have an immediate effect) until the Crossroads phase.
You get rid of your trauma tokens (or possibly gain some) by having encounters with ""Allies"" on board Galactica and Colonial One (but not on Pegasus). That brings me to the next new element in this variant--ally cards. There are 35 different ally cards, including every main character (Adama, Apollo, Starbuck, Baltar, etc.) not already being played (or not already executed) and a few whose names I never knew before.
There are always three allies waiting to be encountered on the board, and each one has a trauma token on their card waiting to be revealed. Once that token is revealed, an interaction occurs. If the trauma token is benevolent, a generally good action happens. If the trauma token is aggressive, a generally bad action happens. And a disaster token causes immediate execution.
When an ally card is resolved, a new ally card is drawn and the player who encountered the last ally gets to place one of their trauma tokens on the new ally--either ensuring a good result or setting up a bad result for someone else to resolve. You also gain a trauma token any time you go to the Brig or to Sickbay.
When the Crossroads phase begins, the battle of the Ionian Nebula is set up (see above) and then the judgment phase starts. Each player gets one of seven Crossroads cards and must use one of their trauma tokens to determine the outcome of the Crossroads card, either benevolent or aggressive. Then after their Crossroads card is resolved, each player discards the tokens that helps their species (Cylons discard aggressive tokens and Humans discard benevolent tokens). And anyone with two or less tokens left discards them.
At the end of the Crossroads phase, whoever has the most negative trauma tokens left gets eliminated from the game (possibly more than one character in the case of ties). That means no new character, you're just done and you're out of the game. You're a Human who has been ""permanently"" executed by the fleet or your Cylon line has been boxed.
After the Crossroads phase, the remaining players must finish the battle of the Ionian Nebula. If the Humans jump away, they win.
In my first ""Ionian Nebula"" game, Anders was executed when he drew a disaster token when he was sent to Sickbay. Everyone in the game survived the Crossroads phase, but the Cylons won the battle of the Ionian Nebula (and the game) when the Humans ran out of fuel.

If you enjoy playing BSG, then by all means buy Exodus. Though be warned that this expansion makes things much tougher for the Humans and has a lot of new rules and options that may be overwhelming to some players. While it is possible to combine all three variants in Exodus with the base game (you could even include Pegasus), you are in for a long and complicated struggle if you do. If you're a new player, try just the base BSG game first, then check out the Pegasus expansion before buying Exodus. But in any case, enjoy playing Battlestar Galactica!!!",4.0
"Main game mechanics
I liked the new cards put into this expansion.  The cylon fleet board can be ""gamed"" a bit, but I still like it more than the random cards in the crisis deck.  I personally hate the rule about having a buried loyalty card.  I was told it was to make executions more risky, which I guess it does, but only by hurting the cylons in the first place.

I have not tried this endgame yet.",4.0
"Some would say it adds difficulty. Others refuse to play it again because the pharaoh ate them repeatedly...but I say it was great fun. This particular expansion throws in a piece that goes around the board potentially cursing people. The difficulty level for the entire game was increased (and we were only using the basic Arkham set when we tried this), as well as the frustration level for some of the players during our game.

I will say that if you like a challenge, then this is the addition you should purchase to enhance your Arkham experience. If you don't enjoy that, then this is probably not the expansion for you.",4.0
"I bought arkham horror CODP  for an addition to my overall collection.

It's a nice addition but for my taste it's too thematic. If you are going to play as the herald variant(Dark Paraoh) it's quite okay. However since exhibit items are separate from the unique items it's an additional pile of cards.

However encounter cards and barred from neighborhood mechanic is nice though.",4.0
"Aside from me not liking the Dark Pharaoh Herald much at all, I really have to say that I adore the exhibition mechanic. I pretty much use it in every single game.

The expansion works better with more players as it gives everyone a bit of time to check out the exhibit and possibly get some cool (and helpful) cards.

I recommend it for any Arkham enthusiast.",4.0

I have to admit I gained some confidence in myself, too. The paints are adequate for up to 100 faces ... depending on what you choose to do. I kept my designs simple and small. I didn't attempt the fairy face, though it doesn't look too hard when you have step by step illustrations. The paints wash right off with warm water and soap leaving only the faintest of lines if you don't wash it off well enough. None of the children I practiced on had any allergic reactions to the paints, so I'd say they are mild.

i liked the product.  Met all my expectations.  My grand-daughter loves hearing my voice.  The story could have been just a bit longer.,4.0
"I bought this book for my granddaughter when my son-in-law was deployed overseas so she could hear his voice. It really helped.  Only draw back, it was too easy for her to erase his words.",4.0
"I got this book to give to my niece who lives in another state. I wanted her to be able to hear my voice and remember me because we don't get to see each other often. Recording your voice is easy and straightforward, you can hear it back and redo the recording if you wish. The problems I did have were these: 1. do not speak directly into the microphone or your voice will be very tinny and hard to listen to . 2. There is no way to include a greeting or voice dedication, not even the title of the book. The recording won't start until the first page. 3. Don't read too slow or u will run out of recording time. Other than that I do recommend this product, it's fun and a great gift.",4.0
"The story was simple but sweet.  I would've preferred names other than ""Big Brown Hare"" and ""Little Brown Hare,"" (or something like that) since you have to say the names over and over and over.  The warning is that you need to record it pretty soon after you get it.  This was part of a 3 item order that I placed in June.  In September, I'm ready to record it for my niece's birthday this weekend.  I spent over an hour and a half messing with it late last night when I should've been packing.  I started out okay, but then the recordings would stop in the middle of the playback.  I thought it would be the batteries, so I had to hunt till I found 3 new AAA's.  I replaced them, hoping I could pick up where I left off, since it says replacing batteries won't change anything.  I had more problems, so I had to erase everything and start over.  It kept saying turn to the page you want to record.  I tried everything, but it wouldn't let me record the first few pages, though it let me re-record the last few.  I was so upset.  Today I started the return process, and it said the return window only went through July.  Luckily, I got a lovely Amazon customer service lady who courteously and efficiently handled the situation.  I would've been happy with a replacement, but she said that company's inventory turns over quickly (or something to that effect) so she could do a refund instead.  That works.  And Amazon gets major points for being so easy to work with. I order a LOT through here, and intend to keep doing so.  I haven't read a review that said anyone else has had a problem with these (and they are, after all, Hallmark products), so I'll buy one locally and save my receipt till I know I'm happy with it.",4.0
"My wife ordered this book for her great granddaughter's birthday.  My wife enjoyed recording the book except for the multiple times it would skip a page and she would have to start over at the beginning.  Her son and daughter in law reported that it was a hit with the little one.

"This product arrived fairly quickly. It has some really good cards, but most need to be in the dino deck to work. However there are some that you could take and put in other decks like ""negate attack"" or ""lightning vortex"". Overall this was a really good buy. I was especially pleased with the fact that there are several monsters w/ high attack in this deck. The magics were ok at best, and the traps were useful but most of them would only work in this deck. I would recommend this deck, although you would have to make modifications to it. I mean like add other cards to it like a monster reborn or a mirror force.",4.0
This deck is awesome! Sure i tweaked it a little but its great out of the box too. Im currently 4-1 with it.,4.0
"Bought this for my 6.5 yr old son.  He has a bunch of cards already, but he was excited to see all the different types of cards this came with since he's been getting many duplicates from the booster packs.  Anyways, based on his excitement I rate this as 4 stars; otherwise, these are just cards...",4.0
"As with the other structure decks available, this is a good start for any novice for veteran Yu-Gi-Oh TCG player.

While it may have less foil cards than the other structure decks, this deck more than makes it up for the strategies employed with the card combos. One general strategy that dinosaurs have is the ability to summon high-level monsters with ease, thanks to cards like Hunting Instinct, Miracle Jurassic Egg, Gilgasaurus, Fossil Excavation, or Big Evolution Pill. Many dinosaurs pack a big punch already, and to be able to get them on the field quickly to overwhelm your opponent makes the game so much fun for its user, and not so much fun for their opponent. Another strategy (one that I personally emphasize in my own deck), is to quickly remove one's own dinosaurs from play to power up his or her Tyranno Infinity. Other support cards like Dimensional Fissure, Survival Instinct, Soul Release, Skull Lair, and so on will quickly boost the attack of this only level 4 monster in no time. That card is the whole reason why I picked up this deck. I'm a little worried that it may land itself on the forbidden/limited list soon.

FUN: I jumped back into this card game after a five year hiatus, and I'm wondering why I stopped in the first place. This time around though, I'm being careful of my spending on cards because it truly can become addicting.
DURABILITY: Unless you have good card sleeves to protect your cards, they will weather away especially if the card is played in decks a lot.
EDUCATIONAL: There is a lot of cognitive thinking when playing the game. There is much math and predetermined planning involved. In order to create the perfect deck for oneself, one must understand and take advantage of the cards and their relations with one another. It may not look it at first, but the skills and techniques used to play the card game well are characteristics that, when honed, will provide self-improvement. I am aware that this sounds a little stretching, but I can put a safe bet that there is much more brain activity when playing this game, than idling sitting on the couch watching television.

The box contains 39 common cards, 1 Ultra Rare card, 1 official TCG rulebook, 1 gaming mat, and a strategy pamphlet that also recommends other cards to supplement this already awesome deck.

"I love the art and the sturdy construction. It folds out into four panels, two are skill DC's, one panel for combat and one for miscellaneous. The choice of charts left a lot to be desired. A DM screen should have charts that you use frequently. How often will I use the huge chart detailing all of the wind modifiers to my Fly Skill DC? I do like that they put page references for all the charts they included. I think many of the charts should have been left as only a page reference. Things that I think are vital to a GM screen, like the Attack of Opportunity chart, were left out. This will make a nice replacement for my 3.5 screen but I will need to continue to use it in conjunction with my Ebberon screen.

"I've had the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM Screen for years, long before I actually started playing Pathfinder regularly.  The purpose of a screen, of course, is so the GM can hide their notes from pesky players, assemble miniatures of diabolical villains without being seen, roll dice ominously, and, most importantly, remind themselves of key rules so the game doesn't have to stop so everyone can flip open their 500+ page rulebooks.  This four-panel screen is certainly a durable product, as it's survived (quite literally) more than a hundred sessions and still looks brand new.  It's made of quite sturdy stuff, unlike many other screens I've seen, and won't easily tip over.

The exterior side facing the PCs is a line-up of the most iconic images of the Pathfinder Iconics: the embodiment of each character class.  I once found the art style a bit over-the-top and cartoony, but I've really warmed to it now and quite like it.  I can't say what it's like to stare at the characters for hours, but there's so many little details on each character that the eye shouldn't get bored quickly!  (Note there are two alternate screens available with different characters, but I don't own either of those).  I've found it quite handy to use paperclips to hold pics of NPCs the party is talking too, monsters they're fighting, etc.

The interior side facing the DM is, of course, what matters!

Two full panels are depicted to summaries of various skills: Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb, Diplomacy, Disable Device, Fly, Heal, Knowledge, Perception, Ride, Spellcraft, Survival, and Swim.  Not every skill is represented, and one could argue that some of the missing skills (like Stealth, Intimidate, and Use Magic Device are used more often than some of the skills that are represented like Swim).  Still, the skills that are included are broken down into very handy, easy-to-read lists of activities, modifiers, and DCs.  It's a very attractive, smart presentation.

The third panel is devoted to combat, and the top half of the panel has five sections:  Attack roll modifiers, armor class modifiers, combat maneuvers, two-weapon fighting penalties, and concentration checks.  With the possible exception of two-weapon fighting penalties (which a player should have figured out well ahead of time), all of these things are extremely important things to have available for easy reference.  The bottom half of the panel is a summary of the effects of common conditions, which is again quite handy--it's annoying to have to stop and look up what the effects of being stunned or nauseated are every time it happens.

The fourth panel is a bunch of miscellaneous stuff, and it's here that I think there was room for improvement.  The left half of the panel is all devoted to listing the hardness and hit points of weapons, armor, common objects, and various materials.  I don't mind this much, because even though this information is needed rarely, when it's needed it's usually important (like whether a sundered weapon is going to break).  Still, I wouldn't have devoted so much space to it considering how much other stuff in the game is probably more important.  The right half of the panel lists experience point awards by CR and treasure values per encounter.  To my mind, this is the least essential information to be on the screen, as most groups handle this either between sessions or at least after a session, when an extra minute to flip open a book is no big deal.  Because most monster entries already list XP and treasure, this is the only part of the screen that I never use.

So on the whole, that's 3 to 3 1/2 panels of a 4 panel GM screen that are
extremely useful!  My biggest problem is actually remembering what's on the screen, as often I look something up in a book only to realize later that it was on the screen the whole time.  Anyway, while a screen like this is not strictly essential, it's about as close as it gets.  A session will run faster and smoother if the GM has one of these, and it's worth the money.",4.0
Useful.,4.0

It has all the charts and tables in a easy to read format and it saves you time so you do not have to go flipping through your books,4.0
"Good quality material, all the instructions and references you would expect from a GM screen.  The only reason it's not a 5 star is because it took over a month to send it to me.  The product itself, however, is great.",4.0
"As a GM, you know what this does, what its for, and how to use it.
As a player its a reference to some rules a hard surface to roll or write on, or a collection of most of the 'iconic' heroes artwork in one place. I would suggest this for anyone who plays pathfinder because of these things. Its made of much stiffer and resilient material than previous editions and coated so it even can survive spills, and falls. I use it as a GM to carry my relevant notes I add to at work for more creative tennis between calls.

I found this product very helpful, but was lacking some information I would prefer such as CR tables, or reference page numbers for full explanations of items presented. Those you can add with sticky notes or even use duct tape to adhere if your feeling squirrely. It cleans up well with no damage to the material.

It is still an indispensable item for any upcoming DM/GM and I think they're going to sell a ton of these.

"It's very well organized, and I'm looking forward to the time when I might get to use it.

Pathfinder appears to be very intriguing.",4.0
"It's well constructed and stands up well on its own.  Unfortunately the quick reference info printed on the inside is very badly organized and located so anything useful is on the outside wings where you may choose not to unfold all the flaps (if you don't really need that big of a screen).  It's also missing a number of the conditions, the main reason an experienced GM would even use the quick reference, severely limiting its usefulness.",4.0
Good for starting out and making sure pc's don't see your preplanned  adventures and dice rolls. Also has short cut facts and stats stuff so you don't have to constantly flip threw the core rules to find frequently used info. Like a giant cheat sheet for pathfinder.,4.0
"Nothing negative to report.  Just a really captivating screen.  I have considered not using it all the time though cause sometimes my wife gets a little side tracked and I find her zoning into the screen and not the scene.  Only thing I would have liked different is if there was a bit on what can be done in a round and provokes an attack of opportunity, and maybe made a little bit bigger to accommodate the extra info.  But other than the negligible stuff I would definitely recommend this screen to someone in the market for one.",4.0
"Overall, I love this screen.  Great construction, great artwork and I really like that page numbers are included.  I like it much better than my WotC screen.  However, like another reviewer said, it doesn't have enough combat actions included.  The Actions in Combat table from the core rulebook is a must add, imo.  I was going to give this 3 stars but because Attack Roll Modifiers and Armor Class Modifiers are included, I am giving it 4.  Minor tweaks and this is an easy 5 star product.",4.0
"I purchased this screen to replace my old 3.5 DM screen. This one is printed on what amounts to hardcover book covers, the colors are great and the artwork awesome. Has all of the useful tables printed inside.

One con, it's just a little tall. It's as tall as a normal paizo hardcover book which is just a tad tall. You can see over it but definitely need to stand if you want to do anything with the battle mat.",4.0

"So far the screen is working out well, the material is holding up to standard wear and tear and the format is pretty decent for the space given.  If you're a DM who's always having to tear through his/her books every few checks, this is definitely for you.",4.0
Aside from looking pretty its actually rather nice. The stock its made of is much much better than other DM screens ive seen. (something like what the book covers are made of) I gave it a 4 because there a couple of small tables i might have included but hay they covered just about all the other bases. Well organized and should last a while. Thanks Paizo!,4.0
Contains many of the tables needed in the Core Rule book and some additional tables for sample dice rolls.  Does not include linguist and what provokes an attack of opportunity.,4.0
This screen is very nice looking as well as useful.  It is heavy duty cardboard.  I believe it will hold up for a long time.  I really like the artwork and the information is very helpful for running sessions.  I would buy it again.,4.0
"I have never seen a GM screen of this quality.  It is a very thick card and very well made, with lots of useful information.  Very good value for money.

Personally, I am not a fan of the Pathfinder 'Anime-style' artwork on the cover, but that is just a taste thing and purely decorative.

There is just one problem with this screen.  It is too tall.  We are used to the shorter style screeen, which the GM can easily look over to check miniature positions, etc.  Our GM had to go get a cushion to sit on for this screen - and he is not short.

Paizo, if you could make a short version of this it would be a 5-star product!",4.0
"I purchased this screen on the weekend and used it for my first Pathfinder session the very next day.

The screen is made from quality material. If you've purchased GM screens for other games, you know the material they are made from are pretty flimsy, usually with just a basic laminate to protect them from wear and tear. In contrast, the Pathfinder screen is made from this cardboard stock and this helps make it rather stable when you unfold it for play.

The screen also has all the basic charts you'll likely need and in a really nice touch, often cites the page number where further elaboration on certain effects/rules can be found in the Core Rulebook.

The screen is not perfect however. The artwork and style of the screen is a little drab. It ""features"" just the static iconic characters standing, there's no action, no detail and no sense of adventure at all in the visual style of the screen. Older screens for other games had much more compelling artwork. Also, a lot of times screens come with an additional two panel ""mini screen"", which you can use to further cover your notes and dice rolls. This screen is just a single 4-panel wall, with no additional mini-screen.

It's a very decent screen though, made of quality material with all the right charts and notes on the interior. So it is worth the price to be sure. However, if you want something much more customizable and flashy, buy one of the ""blank template"" screens, that allow you to insert your own artwork, charts and information on each panel. You'll likely walk away with a screen that's just as functional, but has a lot more style than the drab artwork presented in this product.",4.0
"Good starter kit, but so much is available online for free.  If you have any RPG experience, skip this and go for the rulebooks and a map.  If you don't, this is a great way to get introduced.  Our kids loved it!",4.0

"A good intro to pen and paper roleplaying for the newcomer.  It works well and character creation is quick and has an easy to follow guide.  However, unlike the old Basic D&D boxed sets, it lacks much info that would be good to advance beyond your first few games.  Still, I would recommend it as a jumping off point for someone interested in trying gaming.",4.0
Basic gear for literally brand new players looking to get started. Any previous knowledge should find something else.,4.0
"Lets be honest, this beginner box is really intended for one purpose, to provide an easy stepping stone to get folks started in to playing an epic game!  And that is why you should buy it.  Are you having a hard time getting your spouse, kids, or friends interested in playing Pathfinder with you ( and you should be trying to play with SOMEONE if you are not currently)?  This is a very beginner friendly setup to get them started.  I just loaned it to my nieces and nephews to try and get them and my brother started.  And my motive is not purely selfish, I know that if they get started they will love it because I know they already love stories, fantasy, board games, social gatherings, epic characters, etc.  In my experience, Pathfinder has done something really great by carrying the banner of D&D 3.5 on to integrity and greatness.  I tried D&D 4th ed for a year and ended up literally selling the core set to buy Pathfinder.

Though there is potential to get many hours and sessions out of this game, the best way to use it is to play it with a group of people for 1to 4 sessions and then get them into the full Pathfinder role playing game if they are interested.  But that doesn't mean you throw this box away, oh no.  You pull it out with different groups whenever someone wants to play a game who hasn't tried this yet.  It will help them understand why you like roleplaying, and it just might grab some of them to want to join your regular group or start their own.

For the price, it is almost worth it just to get the dice, cardboard figures, and reusable maps.

Come on, roleplaying is just too much fun to keep to yourself!",4.0
"The only reason its not a five star review is because I would have loved if they would have included any hero or monster miniatures, other than that its an over all great product, you get an excellent two sided map that you can write on and create your own maps with a wet/dry erase pen, lots of value in such a small box.",4.0
"This box does a great job of laying out the basics for brand new players. The books are superb quality as is the art. However, if you're a brand new DM be VERY wary of the beginner adventure. The combats are VERY DIFFICULT for 1st level PCs, especially the ""boss"" encounter. To expect ANY group of new players to go through this dungeon without multiple rest periods is sheer folly. The final encounter is FAR FAR too difficult for any beginner group so prepare to fudge the crap out of it.

The final dragon has a AC of 21. Our fighter who has a 20 str has to roll a 16 or better to even hit it. So essentially NO non-fighter first level PC can hit this creature in melee unless they roll 20. Meanwhile the dragon can easily take down 3 PCs in one full round action by merely rolling maybe an 8 or better (two claw attacks +9 1d8+str, bite +10 1d10+str) oh and it has reach. ALL 1st level PCs have less than 15 hit points. Thus, in one full attack action it's very possible if not likely that this creature could down 3 PCs to zero or negative hit points.

Also, there are just random things inside the dungeon that make no sense...no concept of dungeon ecology really. Also the swim checks in the room with the lake are quite difficult for first level PCs with 1 or less ranks in Swim. A couple PC's nearly drowned just from bad rolls, which makes for an unrealistic and stupid encounter. Other than the boss fight this was the hardest encounter (not drowning).

A new DM that didn't know what was going on would likely wipe an entire group with this module.

WELCOME TO PATHFINDER!

that being said this is the best beginner package for any table top RPG game. be prepared to tune the adventure on the fly to prevent unneeded PC deaths.",4.0
I bought this game on accident but stated playing it and really enjoyed the info it brought me and enjoy playing the game with friends,4.0
"I got this because my 8 year old started to show an interest in role playing games and miniatures wargaming.  He devoured the contents of the hero's handbook. The slick glossy paper and nice looking art might have had something to do with that. He and his brothers all wanted to help me punch out the three pages of counters that are available. All in all it was a nice starter kit for pathfinder and tabletop gaming in general. The path finder pawns aren't quite minis but they are cheaper, the art is nice, and by introducing the children with the beginner box with pawns they've gotten to expect pawns. The reversible flipmap is nice. I've used it a couple of times for follow on 'adventures', drawing on it with a dry erase marker. The box is theoretically good through level 5, which should take months. I bought the core rulebook soon afterward to enhance the experience.

This box was a good deal for the money. It got new players interested in the game and was fun for new players to play though and fun for this old veteran to dm/gm/story teller/whatever its being calls these days",4.0
"I learned a lot about this game thanks to this starter set.  I invited my friends who along with me have never played it before and we learned real quick based off both the guides it gives you.

Pro:
Easy to use
A lot of monster, and character stands.
Comes with a premade map, and a regular grid.

Cons:
Guides while helpful are pretty generic, and at times lack what you want to do (ex. You get maybe 4 classes to chose from where there are a bunch more in other books.)

In the end its what you pay for.  If you are completely new to this game it will help you get ready to buy the other books.",4.0
"Pathfinder hit the shelves to fill the gap that Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 left behind. The hefty 500-plus page rulebook has everything you need but it can be daunting and seemingly complicated, especially to new gamers, so what better way to introduce new people to the hobby than with an introductory game.

THE BOX

The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Beginner Boxset is a lovely looking 23 x 29 cm box and at 6.5 cm deep with a decent weight you immediately feel you've got your money's worth. The Wayne Reynolds cover art is action-packed and dynamic and sets the tone well. The presentation is very good and the design and weight makes for an attractive product.

INSIDE THE BOX

Upon opening the box I'm greeted straight away with a packet of seven red dice of the varying shapes and a packet of black stands for the card pawns that come with the box - more on those later. Under this these packets is an introductory sheet that explains what to read first depending on if you are reading on your own, if you want to be a player, if you want to make your own character or if you want to be the Game Master. It's basically pointing you in the right direction and telling you what you need to do first depending on what you want to do with the game. Good start.

The 64-page Hero's Handbook follows and in this full-colour softback book you have all the instructions you need to create and use a character for the game. It starts with a short choose-your-own-adventure gamebook called Skeleton King's Crypt and it takes you through 23 options in which you get to experience the basic rules and what they mean in a game. This is followed by a clear and well presented example of play, followed by the normal character creation. This book talks you through every aspect of character creation slowly and methodically, with plenty of illustrations, colour coded pointers and detailed explanations. There are plenty of things left out to make the creation process simple for new gamers; the lists of races, classes, feats, spells, and skills have been cut down to a minimum. You can choose form a Dwarf, and Elf or a Human, and your classes are limited to Cleric, Fighter, Rogue and Wizard. As this is a beginner's game the reduction of options is a bonus. The book is illustrated with great art throughout.

Next there are four character pamphlets for each of the four classes, four-page sheets of pre-generated Heroes that detail what the class does, their stats, and a short example character bio on the back. The centre pages have the statistics and are flanked by references to everything on the sheet, explaining what each section does, how it works, and what you can do in a round during combat. It's a great idea and gives new gamers everything they need for their first outing.

Then you get four full-colour character sheets, easy to use and with details on there, such as a dice recognition chart and references to where you can find details of certain sections.

Next is the 96-page Game Master's Guide, which contains everything you need to know about running games. It stats with a nest adventure, Black Fang's Dungeon, and this takes you through a standard dungeon crawl step by step. After that it goes into detail as to what is expected from a Game Master, including basic Game Mastering rules, how to build adventures, using the environment, magic items, a large monsters section, random encounters, and Sandpoint, a fully fleshed out campaign town and area with some adventure ideas for players to game in. At the back there are some reference pages so that first-time Game Masters don't have to trawl through the books looking for basic details.

The large foldout map is next, which you can use with markers to detail locations. It has plain brown on one side and the map for the introductory adventure on the other. Both sides are squared for use with the pawns that come with the box and normal miniatures.

The three boards of pawns give you more than 80 cardboard minis you can stand up in the plastic stands in the box. They're fully detailed in colour and represent all the Hero races and classes, in both sexes, and all the monsters in the Game Master's Guide. They're hardy and incredibly well made, perfect for both this boxset and gaming in general and will last a long time.

The final one sheet details where to go once the players want to go beyond level 5, and is basically an advert for the full-on Pathfinder Core Rulebook and accessories.

CONCLUSION

The Pathfinder Beginner Box was designed to act as an introductory game to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It's obvious that new players would buy this then progress onto the Pathfinder Core Rulebook with its vast options as the sides of the box itself is covered in advertisements for the main rulebooks and the books explain how to move on to them form the boxset. They may have been the intention, but what Paizo have produced is a very good introductory game for the roleplaying hobby in general. Every part of the Pathfinder game and the hobby in general is explained in detail and new gamers are taken step by step through ever aspect. This in itself makes it an excellent game and I'd have no hesitation in buying or recommending this for someone who I know wanted to get into the hobby. You could leave this with them and their friends for a couple of weeks and they'd be ready to get into the hobby no problem. Everything is explained.

This only makes the game accessible to the new gamer, mind you. If you're an old hat at roleplaying - the Pathfinder game in particular - there's nothing in here you'd need. Experienced gamers would find the Pathfinder Core Rulebook suited to their needs and wouldn't have to get this, unless they had new gamers they wanted to bring into the hobby.

But it's not the experienced gamer this is aimed at. The selling point of this boxset is the fact that it is aimed at brand new gamers interested in getting into the hobby. For that fact alone it excels in its intention.

If you've been gaming for a while then there's not a lot in this boxset that you'll find useful, unless you've never played Pathfinder before and feel a little daunted by the huge Core Rulebook. For new gamers, however, this is the perfect introductory game not only for the Pathfinder system but the roleplaying hobby in general, so for you it's highly recommended.",4.0
"i've played dungeons and dragons 4e for a good year now and my friends and i are taking a break from our campaign. one of my players told me that we should try pathfinder, and i told him how i've been interested in trying it out too. since D&D is going through a beta playtest for its new edition i figure why not? i saw this box at my local hobby store so i bought it. here's what you get, a pack of die (d4,d6,d8,2d10 one with tenths the other in one values, d12, and a d20), a nice little sheet telling you want to do if you want to be a player or a Dm or GM (i prefer DM), which you get 2 books a GM guide and a Player's guide, 4 pre made characters and 4 blanket character sheets. now! this is where it loses a star because after we played a quick session with the module adventure inside we like the system and since we have some experience with table top RPG in general we have not played 3.5e of D&D which this is based from. that's not a bad thing, but my main beef is the character creation and character sheets. after this box i bought the core rulebook, bestiary, and game mastery guide. in the core rulebook the character sheet towards the back is WAY different than the beginner's character sheet. in the beginner's character sheet its conveniently made in an order which is easy and effective and not too much of a hassle. in the core rulebook you have different organization problems also new terms which the beginner's box left out are the CMB (Combat Maneuver Bonus) and CMD (Combat Maneuver Defense). i know they're different its a reason its called the beginner's box, but i feel it should still cover those terms especially since i'm not familiar with that kind of bonus and defense.

aside from that being my only negative, its a fun little introduction to a system that many call the 3.75e. i like what i read and its very simple and easy to grasp definitely recommend to anyone who's interested in trying a tabletop RPG and interested in trying Pathfinder.",4.0
"Overall, this is an excellent purchase. As a 3.5 player, I purchased this for three reasons; one, to get a few friends into tabletop RPGs, two, to convince my 3.5 group to switch to Pathfinder, and three, to teach myself about running a game rather than playing.

The quality I found in both the Hero's Handbook and the Game Master's Guide were far, far greater than I imagined. I had expected cheesy little leaflets filled with a very simplified version of the rules. While the rules are indeed simplified, they are easily adaptable to the rules found in the Core Rulebook. Instead of overly simplifying the rules, they simply omitted more specific rules, which can easily be added for more experienced players and GMs. Furthermore, the books are actually quite substantial considering the price of the box and the nature of their content. The Hero's Handbook is 64 pages while the Game Master's Guide is 96- each book actually has all the information you'll need for running a few sessions of Pathfinder. The Game Master's Guide alone  was worth the purchase; as a novice GM I have already found this book to be an indispensable quick access guide for dungeon creation and game facilitation.

The dice are nothing special, just your typical set of 7 dice: 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d10 (percentile), 1d12, and 1d20. About the same quality you'd get from Chessex. I actually prefer the format of the percentile d10, though I do not like the 'bottom' style d4 found in this box.

As someone who never plays with miniatures, I actually found the included two-dimensional pawns to be quite nice, and I've found myself using them instead of writing a letter inside of a circle on the battle map. What I have not found myself using is the Flip-Mat. It will require some serious breaking in before it actually stays flat, making it almost impossible to use well with miniatures. I'll stick to drawing my dungeons on graph paper ahead of time, thank you. This is really my only complaint with the product, however, and the reason for the 4 instead of 5 star rating.",4.0
"First off I been playing pathfinder the RPG for a couple years now so I didn't really need this product for me but some friends had some friends and they wanted to learn to play so... Anyways I don't want to repeat everything people have posted here as it is a good place to start to learn RPGs I just wish there had been a little more to it. As it is it starts with a dungeon of about 8 or 9 rooms with suggestions for more (It also has a play along play by yourself part where you can read along and if you want to go right turn to 4 B or if you want to go left go to 6 C and read it). I am giving this 4 stars because way back when I first started playing RPGs and what I got was a little boxed set that had dice, a crayon. a D&D basic rule book and a module called B2 Keep on the Borderlands and I remember playing that module again and again and getting characters from lvl 1 to lvl 3 over and over again. We got a lot out of that little boxed set. I guess I am being unfair in that no one makes things the way they used to and comparing a modern product to something I got over 20 years ago that took many weekends of play versus the modern product that is good for maybe an hour or two tops. In case you are interested in this product the pathfinder folks did put some stuff up that are free downloads that work with this boxed set which adds to the value of this set considerably as it adds another character class (Barbarian) and some more short adventures so check out pathfinder.com/beginnerbox (or something like that, just do a search). They also have some free modules and other stuff available for download and in particular I seem to remember a module called Hollows Last Hope that was a beginning adventure for those new to pathfinder. I think it could be converted over to the beginner boxed set rules fairly easily and those folks really focused on this boxed set could incorporate that into their campaign (just remember to convert it to the boxed set monsters etc it is written for the regular rules from what I remember, its been awhile since I ran it :))

All in all this is one of the best starter sets I have seen in awhile and I have seen plenty. Over all I think it is really really good I just wish they had added a little more to it with a free module or something that people could really sink their teeth into like a revamped B1 or B2 or even redoing Into the Haunted Forest which was a great little module introducing people to the pathfinder RPG when it first started (and I still recommend that module as a good intro module).",4.0
"This is provably the first review that will only give 4 stars (4.5 actually) instead of 5, and let me explain why.

My rating has to do mostly with what I expected from the product as a semi new player, not in comparison with other previous RPG starter box products (which I have no knowledge of), so please, keep this in mind why my review might be somewhat (hopefully in a fair way) biased.

Before I bought actual the product, I learned that the box had a level 1 adventure included.  Well, it turned out that it wasn't long enough for it to move on to the next level.  Then I learned about the free wonderful little adventures called ""Beginner's Box Bash Demos"" provided by Paizo.  Very good stuff, I must admit, yet they are just a bit more than a taste of how a (short) excellent level 1 adventures should be, and it wasn't anything like (length wise) the entire adventure provided by the box itself.

Why am I ranting too much about ""not providing level 2-5 adventures,"" you may ask?  I do have a healthy interest of becoming a casual GM.  Yet, since my last year of college (the only year when I got into RPG games) we lack a competitive GM in our small playing group (all of us are semi new to the game).  Simply put, all of us are genuinely interested in getting into the game, but as young adults who are trying to get by, we simply lack the experience and time.

Where I am getting at?  I want Paizo to publish a 150~200 page step-by-step adventure book that continues the adventure provided by the stater box (at the end of page 15 in Game Master's Guide, where they left off).  I suggest it to be a ""beginner box expansion"" where another set of dice is included, with more creature tokens, maybe 2-3 more 1-5 level classes even, and of course, a 150~200 page level 2~5 adventure guide.  If all this is too much trouble, I wouldn't mind if you would only publish a 200+ page adventure hardcover book, similarly priced to a non-core hardcover book.  You see, I think this starter gave lots of amazing ideas how to start and run level 1 adventures, but only gave vague ideas how continue -let alone finish- through level 5.

Finally, I want to finish my review by saying that this product is still provably the best way to learn how to play a (great but fairly complex) RPG in a very approachable way.  Literally, the only thing you need is few zipper plastic bags (to store your tokens and dices) and a non-permanent marker.  Yet, with only a level 1 adventure included, I feel that for some of us the potential to utilize these amazing resources are wasted, if you lack an experienced person who can guide the rest us, who aren't very knowledgeable at the game.",4.0
"The dice overall are pretty good, the runes look cool and the numbers are easy to read. Some people might have to get used to reading the runes when landing on the maximum number the die have written on them, for example a d6 landing on 6 or d20 landing on 20. Study runes on the dice for about a minute and then shouldn't have a problem reading them anymore.

These dice are not perfect however. The pack of dice I received did have some flaws.
Some of the paint on the die was chipped off, probably from shipping, but it's nothing I can't fix with a little bit of paint.
The d100 had two cuts on it about 1mm deep, thankfully not on the the numbers. The cut might affect the center of gravity when rolling with it..",4.0
"Not quite as good as Kill Doctor Lucky, but still a great game! You don't get spite tokens in this one, instead all cards are discarded when you use them and the board is split into four parts. Throughout the game the board sinks and you can't use that section anymore. This leads to more save attempts and the game normally lasts about 30-45 minutes.",4.0
"Dr. Lucky moves around a sinking ship in a somewhat predictable pattern, while the players attempt to save him.  The catch is that at least one other player must be able to witness your heroic deed.  And of course everyone wants to be the hero, so all the other players want to save him before you do.

There are 3 types of cards:
-Equipment that you can offer the doctor to help save him (such as a warm blanket, a flare gun, or ""shark spray"").
-Failure cards that other players will use to foil your attempts to save him.  Some of the Failure cards are numbered, and the flavor text creates a logic puzzle (I think that's what it is) if you read them in order.
-Room cards that can either move you or the doctor into a specific room, or use their printed value to move a certain number of rooms in any direction.

The game board and the card deck are split into 4 sections.  You always draw cards from the lowest section first, and when they're gone that part of the board sinks, moving any players on that board up to the next level of the ship.  If nobody saves the Doctor before the uppermost deck sinks, then everyone loses.  This has never happened when I've played.  After about a half-dozen games it seems like someone usually saves him with only one or 2 of the decks gone.

The colorful cardboard figures are thick and sturdy with plastic bases.  The cards are average quality, non-textured.  If you're looking for a fast-paced, humorous family strategy game that goes way beyond ""Sorry"" and plays in under an hour, this one definitely deserves to be on your table.  The play mechanics are very similar to ""Kill Doctor Lucky,"" but if the ""killing"" theme deters you from picking up that game, this one will not disappoint.",4.0

"I bought these cards for my preschooler to encourage math learning is a fun and interactive way.  There are six game decks included in this set: Crazy Eights, Easy Addition War, Go Fish, Memory, Old Maid, and Sequencing.  Here's what I like and don't like about them:

Pros:
- Cards are oversized, about 1.5 times as large as a regular deck of playing cards
- Colorful illustrations to capture any preschoolers attention
- Each game comes with a set of rules and variations (in case it's been many years since you've played Old Maid!)
- The box is great for storage and organization
- Crazy Eights and Go Fish can be easily played with a standard deck of playing cards.  The only difference being that these cards are larger and have child friendly illustrations.  The Go Fish deck actually has different types of fish with interesting facts about each.  So while you're playing, you can be learning about the intricacies of fish as well!
- Easy Addition War has two numbers to add (ex. 1 + 2).  The illustration shows 1 drum and 2 flutes to help a preschooler better understand the concept of addition using numbers and objects.
- Memory has 27 pairs of illustrations of easily recognizable things (keys, dogs, leaf).  The illustrations are a little rough.
- The Old Maid set is probably my favorite of the bunch.  The illustrations are cute, clear and just overall well presented.  The Old Maid looks like a frog wearing a dress with a bonnet and a purse.
- The sequencing set has two levels (three card and four card sequences).  The illustrations could be better.

Cons:
- The cards are hard to remove from the box.  There's very little room to squeeze a finger in to get any leverage.  You almost have to tip the box over, hold the other sets in and let gravity take over to get a deck out.
- A few of the cards have blue residue from the back of other cards that rubbed off onto the face of the next card.

If you're looking for a way to instill fun in learning these cards are a great way to do it. Just remember to have a little patience to get the cards out.",4.0

"I missread the description and thought that these bags came in a set of 4. My mistake. They come in 4 different designs. I ordered this and the blood design, and they are nice bags.

Though I would have gone for somethig cheaper if I had known I was only receiving one bag.",4.0

This is a pretty nice bag for the price.  I have four sets of dice I use for D&D and they don't even take up half of the space.  The drawstrings are a bit loose and don't keep the bag closed completely.  Aside from that minor issue this bag is great and I love the look.,4.0

I would suggest it.,4.0
"as far as size goes, this one can hold over 100 dice. i have over 100, and they all fit. the sword pattern is sewn into the bag, so it won't wear off or fade. i assume any of the other patterns available (vortex, blood splatter, i think i saw one or two others) would all be of the same quality. if you like the looks, you will like the bag.",4.0

"The Adventurers second installation is set in Horus' Temple where falling rocks, scorpions, snakes, and crocodiles can hurt you. That's right, hurt you but not kill you! The mechanic that your wounds and treasures make your player move slower makes sense and makes the game come alive! I enjoy this game and everytime my family and I play we laugh whenever the boulders crash onto the board. The player pieces could be better (they aren't painted) but they are playable. There are mummies you move which don't add much danger but are in simply for theme. Although the danger in the cards and inevitable falling rocks at the end of each turn sequence make the game fun, the action of movement is slow[...] On each turn you roll dice for all the players to use individually; depending on the load you're carrying (teasures and wounds) you have that many actions.

Example: You roll the five dice and you get 2,3,3,4,4. If your load level is 2, you can take 5 actions (one for the 2 die, one for each 3 die, and one for each 4 die); if your load level is 3, you can take 4 actions. The numbers on the dice don't come into use until you win an idol card (there are 5).

An action can be turning a card over, moving one space, or opening a sarcophagus. I find it slow because as most players will be moving minimally, rocks are falling on spaces blocking the exit, sealing you in. It is an adrenaline rush if you really get into the game and I wouldn't change it but if you like fast paced games, this may not be the one for you.

So in closing, the player with the most treasure, if more than one person makes it out of the temple, wins. Enjoy!",4.0
"This bag feels of good construction and as of this moment, I have not had the issue of loose knots that others have spoken of. I am not concerned with this even if it was to happen as it is a very easy fix. My only disappointment was that the sword is not the ice blue color portrayed in the picture. That was it's biggest selling point for me, I really loved the ice blue on black. I am not a huge fan of the glitter on the sword, but that is just my opinion. I am sure some people really like it.

Even with the deception over the sword color, I am still happy with this purchase.",4.0
"This was a little bigger then I hoped, but was my fault that I did not look at the size.",4.0
"BOTTOM LINE

I like this bag and use it weekly in my gaming. It's not perfect, but I do like it.

DETAILS

I bought this bag to keep plastic miniatures in, and can put a lot of them in there (several dozen). While the fabric doesn't feel especially luxurious, it has held up OK to weekly use for many months without any signs of wear. The sword emblem is also holding up well, with no signs of wear. The only wear item, if you want to call it that, is that one of the draw string knots untied and the string slipped out. I'm sure when I have some time, I can feed it back in and re-knot it. A minor annoyance. When the bag is full, the draw strings do have a tendency to gradually lose their grip (top of the bag slowly works its way open).  Not a biggie, but if you need a bag that will absolutely stay closed during transit, this probably isn't the bag you need.

What would make this bag better in my personal opinion?

a) a more luxurious feeling fabric (softer)
b) an un-truncated sword image
c) beefier string that is less inclined to relax its grip when pulled closed.",4.0

"This figurine is well-made, sturdy, beautifully painted, and very realistic.  It's also very small.  Granted I was subconsciously picturing it significantly larger than the advertised dimensions because of how large they made the picture in the product listing (but that's my fault for falling victim to standard advertising tricks), but its wingspan is barely 6"", and nowhere close to 7"".

I purchased this figurine hoping to use it as a prop for a Halloween/cosplay costume, but not only is it way too small, it's also very securely attached to the base.  (That's a good thing for people who want a quality collector's figurine, but a bad thing for my purposes as I had planned to remove it from the base to use for my costume).  Nonetheless, because it's so beautiful I'll be keeping it as a desk ornament anyway, and will look elsewhere for my costume prop.",4.0

"The base game of Cosmic Encounter is a five-star game in itself. The ""Cosmic Conflict"" expansion set adds a few highly desirable features which make gameplay even more variable.

Most importantly, I consider the accommodation of a sixth player as reason enough to buy this expansion. The base game's limitation of five players may often impose the choice of a different game for the evening.
In addition a variety of new alien profiles and of new card sets can be merged freely into the base game while leaving out the undesired options for another day. The skill level of participating players (beginner, intermediate, advanced) will probably have the most influence in choosing the right mix of options for the occasion. In my opinion, here are the primary options offered, in rank of importance:
1. the 6th player
2. the hazard deck
 3. the additional aliens/powers

The quality of materials is perfectly uniform to that of the base game. This is very important, since any combination of game options feels natural during play.

On the downside, it seems that many of Cosmic Conflict's features are duplicated by ""Cosmic Incursion"", its sibling expansion set.

In conclusion, I consider the addition of either one of the two above expansion sets as a very useful move for a Cosmic Encounter enthusiast (almost a must in my case), but not necessarily of both.",4.0

"This is a great board game! You get a ton of content for the price.

This has some incredible quality. The miniatures are the best out there in my opinion. Right down the last torn cloth of detail. They probaby used the 3D models from the video game to make these. The tiles are also great, no warping at all, nearly entirely cut out and great artwork. The tokens are many and used creatively. I've never seen socmany cards n a board game ever. I love the amoubt of cards you get! And the dice, completely custom high quality engraved dice. Love it all.

However the game is missing something, not sure what, but maybe some house rules could fix whatever it is.

Great game! The board game is slightly better than the video game in concept!",4.0
"I bought this set of magnets for my husband, who is a great fan of The Game of Thrones television show, and I am also reading the books. The design of the magnets is very good. My only complaint is that they should be thicker. Because they were thinner and less sturdy then most of my refrigerator magnets, I decided to display them in the magnetic frame, instead of trying to pop them out individually. Good decision--they make a bigger impact in the large frame.",4.0

"The reviews on bgg all reflect a general consensus: the game is generally very well done (especially the components), but the action (especially during the AI turn) can get a little bogged down, which really detracts from the GoW theme. I still enjoy playing this game (it's my go-to co-op game), but I don't bring it out for non-gamers any more, even if they're Gears fans. I've tried that before, and there was a general disappointment at how slowly the turns progressed.",4.0
"If you like the Gears of War video games, then you will appreciate this take on the series. To start off, this game is set in the time frame of Gears 1&2. This is a 1-4 player game that ""could"" take from 1-3+ hours to complete depending on the mission selected. In the box you will find: instruction manual, mission reference sheet, plastic figures, attack and defense dice, 17 double-sided map tiles, a large deck of cards, and a small deck of cards.

Setup can be a little time consuming but oh well. Players start by choosing a soldier from Delta squad (Marcus Fenix, Dominic Santiago, Damon Baird, Augustus Cole). Each soldier has his own starting weapons and ammo as shown on the character card. Each soldier also has his own special ability. For example Baird can carry 5 weapons instead of 4. Next we shuffle the Order cards and Random weapon cards and place them on the reference sheet. The reference sheet is just a nice way to organize all the cards throughout the game. Now we choose from one of the seven missions. On each mission card, it will list up to three different enemy types that will appear on the map. We grab the corresponding enemy character cards and AI cards. Also listed on the mission card are the general AI cards. AI cards control enemy movement and attacks. Flipping the mission card over reveals the location cards used in this mission. These cards tell us which map tiles we are going to use and, after shuffling them together, what order they will be placed. There can be up to 3 levels in a mission but normally only one level is set up at a time. On the bottom of the location cards, it says what enemies are going to spawn based on how many people are playing. And finally, we place our plastic COG characters on the map entrance and draw our order cards. Order cards are they way we move, attack, and most importantly our health!

OK, that may look like a lot to do but when you have the game in front of you, you will know what I'm talking about.

On our turn, it is a three step process. First we go through the Heal step. Every one has a max hand size of 6 order cards except Marcus which has 7 from his special ability. We can never have more than our max hand size. During the heal step, if we have less than our max, we draw 2 order cards. Second we go through the COG Order step. We choose one order card from our hand and either: perform the text written on the card, move up to 2 areas, or perform 1 attack. Lastly we go through the Locust Activation step. We draw from the AI deck and resolve the actions on the card. Play then goes to the next player. The game ends when the objective on the Mission card is completed or all players are bleeding out.

I won't go over too much on the card and map tile's layout. I will let you read about that in the instruction manual. This game can be hard or it could be easy. Attacks and defense are controlled by dice so it really is chance. Overall I am satisfied with this game but i wish it wasn't left up to the dice to determine my fate in the game but I'll look past it.",4.0

"I was initially very impressed by the magnets, as they are thicker than most flexible magnets are, and I do feel that the quality of the artwork is good. That being said,none of the blue is printed in that color; my House Arryn and House Tully magnets are definitely purple, and the lighter shade on House Arryn wouldn't pass for blue even at a glance. So I like them, and they're of good quality, but the coloring is definitely off for the blue, though all other coloring is dead-on.",4.0

"This game is very well done. I was sceptical at first as to how Gears of War would translate to a board game but I was not disappointed. I purchased this for a friend, and although it took a little while to get set up and rolling, we had a blast. The fast-paced dirty-brawl style of the video game is replaced with a tactical team based strategy game. Although there is a single player option, the game really shines when four players face the Locust horde as a unified front. Multiple missions, randomly generated maps, and a surprisingly good Locust AI make this game great for multiple playthroughs. A good choice for both fans of the game and for board-gamers looking to expand their collection.",4.0
"Let me say off the bat, I am not a fan of Gears of War the Video Game. I have nothing against it, I am just not a fan of First/Third Person shooters. I have played it a few times to understand it is basically your Aliens/HALO/40K type humans vs. the alien Horde romp. What I do like is the quality of Fantasy Flight's board games and I'm a sucker for Dungeon crawls (esp. Sci Fi themed) like Space Hulk, Warhammer Quest and Castle Ravenloft, to name a few. Gears of War was on my watch list and I picked it up when I saw it on deep discount here on Amazon ... Getting a $70+ FFG game for less than 40 was too good to pass up.

My quick review of the game:

It's a slightly different spin on the crawler boardgame ... you are more or less compelled to take bold actions every turn, else you will get crushed in the unending wave of aliens, who are not anywhere near as squishy as you are. The basic mechanic is that your hand of cards is your bank of actions and your life. You can discard a card and take a basic action like move or perform a basic attack. or you can do what is on the card (in order, with little or no modifications) and hopefully have a big turn, but you must keep enough cards in your hand to soak damage, react to attacks and help your allies out when they need a hand. This game is divided into areas as opposed to the common grid, so movement, range and line of sight are a bit atypical (kudos for a line of sight ruler for determining LOS, instead of counting squares). The game certainly has some Ravenloft DNA (the enemy AI is on rails, but having  a semi random deck is nice - no overlord is needed) as well as descent (weapons/abilites will get triggered off of symbols on the dice for a bit of interest and to make the human soldiers not so 'samey')

There is a bit of the 'we have to make this an homage to the video game' so there is an ever present aspect of collecting ammo and weapon drops. This game does do a good job of making this less clunky than otrher systems I have played and the scenarios are a nice touch .... but there are certainly enough components to kitbash your own random adventure.

My only real complaint is the play time is really through the roof. I thought the game's design to keep the humans constanlty on the move would keep things brisk, but in true crawler fashion, even the introductory scenario can take two hours to finish, becuase the game will choke you with enemies seemingly afgter each advance you make ...

that said, it certainly fits into that category of cooperative games that are fun to play win or lose, the game will make for some epic turns but it is a grinder of sorts that you measure more in 'how close were we to winning this time?' than worrying about ultimate victory ... but I'm sure when things do fall in place and the teamwork pans out and you do win that one game against the locust forces, it will be huge!",4.0
This is a nice game for 1-4 players to play cooperatively against the game itself. Because you are playing against the game you also have the ability to play solitaire. The theme very closly fits the PC game of the same name. Like all Fantasy Flight games the components are top notch and the rules do a good job of explaining the game. The game is rated very high on Board Game Geek (currently #22 in Themed game rankings).,4.0

The Alliance game type about doubles the game length. So be prepared to play for a long time. It includes more cards and more game pieces. It's nice to be able to play with more friends. The pile of deck cards we use now is massive. The Cosmic Quake never happens anymore either. So that's a bit of a bummer.

"This review is for the Call of the Wild expansion for the Mansions of Madness board game. Call of the Wild is not a self-contained game; you will need&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansions-of-Madness/dp/1616610158/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansions of Madness</a>&nbsp;in order to play it.

I'll clear the air here by saying that even though I'm a keen Mansions of Madness player the only reason I bought this rather expensive expansion was the stunning Dunwich Horror and Dark Young figures, and although I've studied and read the materials I have not yet played one of the scenarios (and when I do The Dunwich Horror will be first up to bat).

The theme in the set is outdoor adventures, and the handful of scenarios are made more interesting by the addition of some new mechanics that do not include any suggestion that they can back-ported into the original game - there is likely no quick fix for the lengthy set-up of those scenarios you already know and love, just a mechanism in which the set-up is handled in a radically different way than usual in the five scenarios in this box.

Basically, the new exploration card mechanism works like the accelerated start people use in Monopoly; some cards are dealt to the players at set-up rather than going onto the board (though the players only get to look at them after certain events occur). Some cards still have to go on the board. This removes the linearity of the Mansions of Madness investigation process, which is a bad thing in my view, while making set-up slightly quicker - which is a laudable goal.

There are some new tiles that feature new mechanics - a bridge under which you may float in a boat, taking only those fellow investigators that you want; cliffs that are normally impassable borders; single tiles that are counted as two rooms for exploration and horror checks but through which line of sight may be traced and so forth.

There are new counters made from the nice chunky card of the original game; Inserts for the monsters, a new kind of puzzle which challenges the keeper (yes, you read that right) rather than the players, allies which may throw in with investigators for a time, more wound counters and more sanity counters (including some much-needed ""five brains"" counters). There are some additions to the ""tile features"" counters - the boat and two different kinds of pitfall.

There are cards needed for the special mechanics of the new scenarios, one of which does not use a keeper and in which the players may attack each other (this one can be played solo too). These cards are of the usual high standard we've come to expect from FFG.

There are the plastic miniatures: four new investigators and a fistful of new critters including the aforementioned Dunwich Horror and Dark Young of Shub Niggurath. These are unpainted as usual, but of singular quality of casting and very evocative conception.

The Dark Young manages to vamp on the by-now well-known look of the thing, both keeping true to the overall canonical vision but executing it in a new way. Kudos to the sculptor.

The Dunwich Horror is very nice but a tad small (grinning here: a scale model of what Lovecraft went out of his way to not describe would in all likelihood be bigger than the table you are playing on). It was immediately recognizable for what it was from the picture on the box *before* I knew anything else about the expansion and, as I said, was a primary reason for my buying Call of the Wild.

And yes, there's a rule preventing that git with the camera removing the only monster of a given type from play by photographing it. He can't permanently kill the entire race of Dark Young just by photographing one dead one, thank Azathoth. (Why yes, I do think the camera is way overpowered, since you ask).

Allies will require some serious reading as the rules they necessitate adding to the game run to more than two pages. Let's hope they prove worth the trouble.

The two booklets are the same size as the Mansions of Madness ones, with the same internal design.

All packaged in a sturdy box about the size of the one that Forbidden Alchemy comes in.

The scenarios? Well, as I say I haven't had a chance to play them yet. They feature various new takes on the game mechanics - puzzles which the players set the keeper, no-keeper games, no prior set-up, hidden keeper actions and so forth. Whether this goes hand-in-hand with compelling game play is as yet unknown. The lavish production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Alchemy/dp/1616612193/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Alchemy</a>&nbsp;did not preclude lackluster game experience for some players (I personally do not care for the keeper experience in the Return of the Reanimator for example). Your mileage may vary.

Only you can decide whether or not the admittedly high cost of this supplement is worth the added experience you'll get from your Mansions of Madness game. I normally prefer to buy from my local game store so as to keep his lights on and give me a place to meet players for Mansions of Madness and play it, but the high retail cost of this set was just too rich for me without the 18% knockdown I got from Amazon.

I'm knocking off one star for the cost being so high. If gameplay demands I add it back, I'll come back and do so (and admit to it).",4.0

"In August of 2012 the Beta softback book of the new Star Wars roleplaying game `Edge of the Empire' was released to give excited fans a chance to preview, and be involved with the development of, the rules of the game. Four months on and they have released the Edge of the Empire Beginner Game, a boxset designed to not only introduce gamers to the system but new gamers to the hobby.

THE CONTENTS

The box is a simple flip-top container with rulebooks, help sheets, character folios and a counter sheet. There's also a packet of fourteen custom six-, eight- and twelve-sided dice.

Upon opening the box the first thing is a four page pamphlet saying `read this first' in large letters. The sheet details the what a roleplaying game is, including a two-page script-style example, an example of how to use the maps and tokens and then finishing with the scroll up for the adventure book, `Escape from Mos Shuuta'. As with every book and pamphlet in the box the pages are glossy in full-colour, with excellent artwork. As ever, Fantasy Flight Games have outdone themselves with the presentation.

Moving on to the Adventure Book, marked with `read this second', the adventure `Escape from Mos Shuuta' begins after a brief introduction that has more information on roleplaying, the contents of the box and how to use the book in play. The entire book is the introductory adventure that acts as both a walkthrough of how a roleplaying game works and how the rules work. It takes the group through the adventure step by step, explaining how to use the different aspects of the adventure in play. There's the general text that talks you through the adventure, coloured text to read to the players, more that explains the rules and then sidebar notes for extra information and advice. The adventure is split up into six encounters in the settlement of Mos Shuuta on the world of Tatooine, where they'll fall foul of Teemo the Hutt; straight away we're on a world that no doubt everyone knows and is familiar with, so setting the scene isn't too hard. Each encounter takes the players and the GM through plenty of incidents that will need each of the rules in the book, making sue that everything is covered so that the group has been given a good runthrough of the game system. The starship combat encounter at the end rounds out the adventure and by the end the group should be well versed ion the rules and how they work. There's a handy reference sheet on the back, too.

After this there's a single sheet to read called `The Long Arm of the Hutt', which acts as a sequel to the introductory adventure and is available as a free download from the Fantasy Flight Games website. On this sheet there's also an advertisement for the Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook, a 400-page hardback book out in Spring 2013.

Next you've got the rulebook which goes into detail about the rules including more information on the game engine and how to interpret the dice rolls and advancing your character. There's section for expanding combat, skills and talents, followed by equipment, starships and vehicles and a very modest adversaries section.

Then you have four eight page character folios; Oskara, a twi'lek bounty hunter. Pash, a human smuggler. 41-VEX, a `droid colonist. Lowhhrick, a wookie hired gun. Each booklet has duplicated stats with the initial character and the character that can be used in further adventures, another sheet for use and a talent tree. At the back there's a brief character bio. These four characters are the only player characters in the box as there is no character creation system in here. More on that later.

The large poster-sized maps are next, with one side the adventure's YT-1300 freighter in a landing bay, and the other of a cantina, the spaceport control and a map of Mos Shuuta. These are designed to be used with the bag of counters that finish the boxset, coloured markers of friends, foes, monsters and starships.

All in all there's a decent amount of stuff in this box.

CONCLUSION

I'm not even going to bother to go over the quality of the product. The card of the box is little on the thin side but that's my only gripe; the presentation is excellent and everything is clear and concise.

As an introductory game this is a good product, both for existing and new-to-the-hobby gamers; everything you'll need is in here to be able to run a roleplaying session, and the adventure guides you through the game system piece by piece, explaining rules, offering advice and supplying options and hints. The character folios give you all you need to play a character and the rules are marked out clearly on the sheets for GMs and players alike. The first gaming session is an all-in experience as the entire group learns the game, so the GM isn't swamped with pressure. This also means less prep time; if the group is willing to invest a chunk of time in learning the game together they can quickly move onto further adventures. There are other adventures that the characters can have, with a downloadable adventure from the Fantasy Flight Games website, and there are plenty of adventure seeds included to continue the game; you'll certainly get quite a few games worth out of this as the system allows for the characters in the game to advance as they experience the galaxy. This is, of course, a jumping-off point into the full Edge of the Empire game.

My major problem with the boxset is that there are no rules for creating your own characters. The four characters supplied with the game are good and cover the basics of a mixed gaming group but after a while the players will no doubt want to play with something else, and create their own personalities. You can use new characters created from the main rulebook, including the Beta book, but there seems to be very little point. If the box had even included the basics of character creation, or a way to modify the pregenerated characters to suit a players preferences, then that would have added plenty of options immediately and extended the gameplay of the box. There's nothing stopping gamers from adjusting the characters and their backgrounds, but having those very options or the character creation rules to hand would have been a bonus.

The Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game is a very good introduction to the roleplaying hobby and Fantasy Flight Games' newest RPG. It explains the rules clearly and, for old-school gamers like myself who like their dice numbered, it really helps with interpreting the symbols and their meaning. It also captures the feel and adventure of the Star wars universe really well, so even though I do feel as if the character creation rules should have been included to expand a gaming group's options, I have no problem recommending this to new and experienced gamers alike.",4.0

The only drawback I find is the amount of cards printed. The rules state that any deck can have only 3 copies of any given card, but some cards in the core set have only one or two copies. Thus, if you plan on taking this game seriously, you need to buy 3 copies of the core set to make sure you have 3 copies of all cards... and be left with a pile of other cards that won't be needed, but still good to have.",4.0

"Amazing game, one of the all time best, but it is frustrating that there are only single copies of some cards when decks can have 3 copies of cards. That means that if you enjoy the game and want to play competitively in tournaments, you'll have to buy 3 copies of the game. Most players won't play competitively, obviously, but it is a small but significant oversight in an otherwise flaweless game.

Oh yeah, also the manual is among the worst that I've seen. I know how to play the game and when I have a question I spend 5 minutes searching through the seemingly randomly organized rulebook. It's not good at teaching the game or as a reference. Pretty poor overall. Learn from a friend or from an online source.",4.0
"This fills a nice little spot in my collection.  I probably like other two-player duel games better, for example Mage Wars and Diskwars but both of those take upwards of 2 hours to play and both are a little harder to get a new player up and running with.  This game takes probably around 30 minutes per play and isn't too terribly difficult to teach others.

The game is a completely asynchronous card duel.  One player plays a corporation who plays cards with the intent to score them and protect them with cards called Ice.  The corporation plays many of his cards face down and can do a lot of sneaky things this way.  The other player is the Runner, he is trying to steal the cards the corporation plays to score them for himself and otherwise disrupt the corporation player.  Both players have tons of different kinds of cards to augment their ability to do these things.

One thing I realized right away when playing this game though is that the more experience players have with this game the more it changes.  As I said, many of the corporation's cards are played face down and this can lead to some fun strategic options and surprises.  However the more a player knows about the cards and which cards are better and more frequently played and which cards are available to the different corporations the better the runner player can play to avoid those nasty surprises.  The same works the other way around too.  In my first play of this game I used a pretty popular card on my corporation opponent called Account Siphon.  In our second game the corporation player spent his first turn defending against specifically that card.

I'm not sure these changes are for the worse but it definitely changes how the game is played.  It becomes more about playing smart and strategically and less about the exciting ""oh, s***!"" moments.

I like the LCG model when comparing it to something like a CCG rather than another board/card game like Dominion.  Sure, they release a new deck of cards every month but those decks of cards are between 10-20 bucks and you get a full playset of all the cards released.  Only the base set doesn't give you a full playset of all the cards.  This is A LOT cheaper than keeping up with a CCG but the gameplay and deck building still feel very much like one which is great!

After a few more plays and getting into the deck building I don't like this game as much as I thought.  Everything I said above is still true and I do like the ease of entry, hidden card mechanics, and asynchronous gameplay.  However, each side only does a couple of things.  With all the extra content released for the game and hundreds of options available there are very few cards that do something new.  They all do variations on the same things and for that reason the game gets old pretty quickly.  And this is even more egregious BECAUSE of the amount of content they've released.  Also, the theme never really grabbed me.  I like scifi just fine but the art and flavor text on these cards along with the gameplay just don't get a fun science fiction theme across very well.",4.0
The Edge of the Empire Beginner Game is a great way to introduce beginners into role playing. The adventure is fun and the pre-generated characters are cool. I love the dice system.,4.0
"The only reason I gave this a 4, because there are no playmats included.
Playing this game without a playmat is chaos.",4.0
"This is a pretty good raw battle game.  It is great in the fact that there are battles almost every round as this is mostly what the game is about.  Reinforcements keep coming back every round so you really don't 'run out' of troops.  The object of the game is to reach a certain amount of victory points, which in part come from winning little battles.  The pieces are detailed and good looking, the board looks like throw-up but you can see the difference in tiles which is good.  A very interesting game.  My son keeps winning.  He is only 11.",4.0
"Suns of Fortune is one of the more useful FFG Edge of the Empire supplements so far.  It covers a ton of background information on the Corellian system and also has a good selection of new weapons, ships, etc.

"I have been playing EotE since launch and so far the game has been great.
What originally convinced me to start playing was the quality of the Core Rulebook and my urge to find a decent game for sci-fi tabletop RPGs.

This book follows in the same strain as the other two that have come out. Excellent art throughout, and it has everything from new planets, weapons and items, the three new races, and a bunch of new ships.

A must have if you have loved the game up to this point.",4.0
"As has been the case with the other Edge of the Empire books, this is a well made full color beautiful book.

I showed my wife the picture of Han on page 3 and she said ""It doesn't look like Harrison Ford, but that is a perfect Han Solo"".  I did want to see the look on Lando's face though, as he lost the Falcon.  Amazing characters on page 88 and 114.

You get lots of detail on the Corellian System and Sector.  It's remarkable to me how unpopulated the Corellia system is.  5 inhabited planets, but most are practically deserted.  Three have populations in the single millions.  Corellia's 3 billion matches what my SW Atlas says.  Perhaps the lack of people is explained, but I missed out on the reason.

The Sector chapter gives details on several planets (poor Kruz) and paragraphs on the rest of the systems.  There is a lot of information here that a GM could latch on to flesh out a campaign.  Probably my favorite chapter.

Chapter 3 is player options.  I really like the Selonians as a race.  Definitely have to use a female Selonian when I get back to my game.  I'm still not thrilled with a human variant, but the Corellian makes sense.  Always love having new weapons and gear.  Han's vest makes an appearance.  The real big thing is, as you probably expect, we get a bunch of new ships and fighters.  14!  I just love the CL-1C lancet for it's description.  Sounds like a Corellian ship, fast, fast, fast.

The modular encounters just didn't do much for me.  They are fine as drop in encounters (and FSG gives ideas for their use), but I really only like two of them.  That's not a high number of hits out of 9.  I'd have preferred more fluff instead, or drop the size down.  I've really like the full EotE adventures, so I just may prefer the full fleshed out ones at this point in my life.

Still, I would expect a EotE GM to get their money's worth out of this.  Not necessary for a player, unless you really want the gear/character creation without borrowing from the GM.",4.0
"This is a refreshing change from normal d20 mechanics, and is focused on storytelling and role playing, instead of number crunching and min-maxing. Note that there is a free online continuation to the included adventure (which looks to run about 3x longer than the in-box one). There are also 2 other pregenerated characters online.

The good:
-the dice mechanics are very easy (once you learn the new symbols) and makes generating rolls easy
-all the mechanics are centered more on quick play than looking up rules
-the upcoming expansions ""Age of Rebellion"" and ""Force and Destiny"" will keep the settings and gameplay fresh, while giving the players time to get to know and love the characters and mechanics

The bad:
-custom dice are used; a small pack is included in the beginner game, but they aren't really enough to play a larger setting
-the core books and dice are a bit pricey
-space combat isn't as well designed as I would have hoped, but will probably be expanded on in ""Age of Rebellion""

All in all, 4/5 for the beginner game. If you are considering trying EotE, I would HIGHLY recommend starting with this before committing to buying the core book and more dice.",4.0
"This game has a very large instruction manual. But once you've read it and gotten the hang of the game, it goes fairly quickly. I also like that it is designed so that you can not only purchase expansions for the different corporation decks, but you can also customize your defensive (or attacking) deck to the strategy that you prefer.",4.0
"Great game, love the miniatures it plays quickly and is just good with 2 players as it is with 4. It has quickly become my wife's favorite game",4.0
"Reading the Android: Netrunner manual's lore is like reading the premise to a Neal Stephenson or William Gibson novel; in and of itself, this would be enough to make me like the game, because I cyberpunk and there are very few games themed to that genre.

One player acts as a corporation protecting its servers and secrets with ICE - defensive software that is layered in front of the different databanks.  The other player is a runner - a hacker who uses different hardware, programs, and viruses to crack through and steal the corporation's information.  The hidden information element of not knowing what the corporation is hiding or what ICE they're using creates really interesting strategy for the runner, and makes it quite fun to play the corporation as well, tricking the runner to fall into your traps and flatline.

Beyond an appreciation for science fiction, I enjoy that this game is a ""living card game"" with a lot of thought given to balancing out decks.  One of the greatest issues with MtG is that players with enough money can buy some of the best decks, which puts those on tighter budgets at a disadvantage.  Netrunner puts you on a more even playing field with your opponent and the different factions all offer their own fascinating strategies.

My only complaint is that it's only a two player game; however, there are rule sets online which allow 4+ players to participate.  I haven't tried them yet, but intend to.",4.0
"While I personally am not a fan of dice pools, this is one of the best uses of one I have seen.
The dice do a good job of adding a Star Wars narrative feel to the adventure. The advantage and threat markers help give a feel that The Force was with you or against you on a given roll. An interesting twist is to have a success and still have more threat points on the dice than advantages which can foreshadow something dark on the horizon.
The Force die that gives your characters Force destiny points did seem a little arbitrary when compared to the way the rest of the pool worked. Of course, a GM can always use a little handwavium to offset a bad destiny roll to someone who has played the game in a light-sided manner.",4.0
"I like the play style that this game gives you, a little more theatrical than your normal, you deal 5 damage, or, you rolled a 1 so your gun jams. Very interesting system. looking forward to playing it more in the future.",4.0
"Includes everything needed to start play in the system, including dice, pre-generated characters, and a starting adventure.  It is exactly what it claims, a game for beginners in the system, but given that it is a new system, it is not a bad resource.  The dice alone are worth a substantial fraction of the price.",4.0
"I'll preface this review by mentioning I have never played any ccg or tcg before.  I've played some deck builders but this my first real foray into this genre.

Theme:  This is a cyberpunk theme.  I can't see anyone having a problem with this, and it may be even more mainstream(Ghost in the Shell, Matrix) than fantasy-themed games (MTG, LOTR:LCG).  Fans of this genre or fans of the whole ""hacker"" theme will take an immediate liking to this.  Certain mechanics are also very thematic.  The ability for a corporation to trace and tag a hacker, hackers build a rig(computer/program) in order to successfully bypass ice(firewalls).

Gameplay:
The highlight of this game is its asymmetric gameplay.  The two sides have similar objectives which are to score Agendas, but they do so in different ways.  The corporation must advance their Agendas while the Runner tries to steal them.

The corporation uses various programs to protect their servers to buy themselves the time to advance and score their agendas.  The runner on the other hand will be using their own mix of hardware, resources and programs to steal those agendas before they can be scored.

There are alternate win conditions as well.  The corporation can kill the runner if the runner is unable to discard from their hand when required and the Runner can win if the corporation is unable to take their mandatory draw from the drawpile(R&D).

This makes for some highly focused deck building strategies.  Now about deck building, this game absolutely shines when you construct your own deck.  It helps mitigate the luck factor.  Certain abilities will allow the runner to expose certain cards so they know what they're running against or if there's a trap on a remote server.  Or an operation will allow the corporation to dig through R&D to pick out just the right ice to protect them from what the runner has installed.  Like with any card game though, you will still have to deal with being lucky.  Getting that 1 card you need or having all of your agendas in your hand but no ice to protect them.

Learning Curve:
I would give this a high learning curve for people that have never played CCGs or TCG.  The game is so thematic that both sides have their own terms for the same thing.  The drawpile for a runner is the stack while the corporation has R&D.  Trashed cards go into the heap for a runner and archives for the corporation.  There is also various card terminology that would require multiple lookups throughout the game.  The first few games with two people that have never played ANR will probably have each person looking up terms or finding out what specific cards mean or figure out the timing for abilities.  Playing with someone that already knows the game and can give instructions in layman's terms will cut down the time a lot.

Overall, if the basic idea of this game interests you at all, don't let the learning curve deter you.  This is a very much worthwhile game to learn.  With the core set, you get everything you need to start playing and you get a general idea of inherent strategies that go along with the 7 different factions.  There are 3 runners and 4 corporations and they all play very differently.  Going through each one and trying out different matchups adds a ton of longevity just to this set alone.  There's some limited deck construction options which can also drastically change strategies.  If or when you start getting bored of this, there are data packs you can buy.  This adds another 60 cards for more customization.  These data packs are also fixed, so you know what cards you are getting and you can look at lists to see what data packs improve you're specific strategy.  I'd also like to add that many reviews mention deck building, but this isn't a deck building game like Dominion.  The decks here are preconstructed.

Although I absolutely think highly of this game, I give it 4 stars due to its learning curve.  For brand new people to the genre, it may take several plays before they like it.  While the customizable nature of this may be a positive for those accustomed to CCGs, those that are familiar with deck builders like Dominion may be a bit overwhelmed.

Other thoughts:
- Games can be short or ridiculously long depending on where some of those agendas are distributed in the deck
- Completionists may need a second or third core set to get some 1 and 2 off cards
- Having one person that knows how to play and kind of using the first few games as an opportunity to gradually introduce the various mechanics makes everything flow much faster(nothing more frustrating than having to look up rules every turn or getting surprised by some new card mechanic)
- Can get a bit ""mathy"", when ice starts piling up on a particular server, you'll need to start calculating how many credits you'll need for a successful run or you may be wasting your time and money",4.0
"My friends and I really enjoyed this game overall. Ourt group consisted of myself as Game Master, 2 other roleplaying veterans, a novice, and a Star Wars fan with little to no previous RP experience. Teaching the rules for this system using the resources provided was a snap. Everyone caught on quickly, and the system lended itself well to telling a fun and engaging story even during combat. There were a few downsides, though. First, the dice system is pretty fun, but the symbols aren't really obvious about what negates what, so there was a bit of confusion. Second, every roll requires a piece of scratch paper to tally up the totals and it really slowed things down. Another downside was that the resources insisted on not telling us all the rules at once saying things like ""dont worry about this for now"" or ""treat this the same as X for now"" which just makes things more confusing later on. The last major downside was that the module seemed to rely very heavily on the players following along exactly, and without a real rulebook, it was impossible to improvise. The Wookiee player often wanted to subdue enemies by grappling them, but there was no mention of how to go about that in any of the materials provided.

Overall though, the game was a lot more fun than it was bad. Our group even got back together and played the additional material found online: ""The Long Arm of the Hutt."" If you like Civil War era Star Wars and prefer your RPGs to focus on interesting events as opposed to just a string of combats, this is worth a play. It doesn't break the bank and comes with basically everything you need (though more dice would have been nice since at least one of the PCs needed more green proficiency dice than there were included) so you can easily decide if spending the money on the Core Rulebook and GM guide later will be worth your while.",4.0
"The Edge of the Empire Beginner Box seems like a good introductions to Fantasy Flight Games new Star Wars RPG, but while it seems like it will be great for helping get a new group up and running, it's not great for someone who just wants to get a taste of the game for themselves before the Core Rulebook comes out. That was my reason for getting it. At this point, I don't have a group to dig into this boxed set with, and with the included adventure being built around a party fo 4 or so pre-generated characters this isn't a great intro for one person to get a feel for the game.

My other gripe is, as others have noted, the complete lack of any information on the various classes that will be available in the full game. The 4 pre-generated characters do give some hints at what the character classes will be like, but compared to the Pathfinder Beginner Box which provided abridged charcter creation and class rules for 4 classes, the EotE Beginner Game comes up short. To me, the best way to learn the rules has always been to roll up characters. There are sections on skills and equipment, and even vehicles, but without the class framework, I found it hard to wrap my head around the included material - and I've been playing RPG's for 25+ years.

I guess what I'm trying to say is set your expectations accordingly. If you think you can buy this box and learn the basics of the game yourself, you probably can, but it isn't very easy since most of the rules are introduced in the adventure. But, the included counters, maps and adventure seem to be top notch. The dice are included, which would be $8 at least to buy when the Core Rulebook comes out - so you can buy this box and figure $8 of the price is getting you those dice. And make no mistake, the custom dice (or a dice app on your phone or tablet) will be required to play - your old poly dice from d20 systems won't translate. Overall, I'm pretty happy with what I got, but I feel like it's missing some important pieces to get someone new to the system up to speed.",4.0
"Roleplaying games can be one of the most rewarding experiences for new and old players alike.  Instead of getting your digital kick by movie or videogames, you turn on the most powerful machine ever: your mind!  For those uninitiated, RPG's, the traditional pencil and paper type, put you into the role of a hero in a fantasy or sci-fi setting along with any friends you choose to share in the experience.  Since it says Beginner in the title, let's look at it from the beginner's perspective.

PRO'S
-everything is pregenerated and accounted for (literally pick up a character and go!)
-slick production quality of character sheets make for new players to easily track their progress
-colorful dice
-map and counters to keep track of everything
-adequate rulebook for getting into nitty gritty
-html link so you can download the FREE remainder of the provided storyline
-well-fleshed out introductory characters (warrior/archer/healer/thief archetypes)

CON'S
-I'm not a big fan of the flimsy box-it makes storing it back onto a bookshelf or gaming cabinet a little tough (look up Dungeons and Dragons box for reference)
-reading/readying-even though it's for beginners, the Game Master (GM) who acts as a narrator and antagonist should read everything through ahead of time anyways, players can literally just pick up and go
-true beginner's box-if you're a veteran and want it only for the taste of the game rules and settings, go right ahead but there is very little room for character customization.  On the other hand, the story arc is plenty interesting and I could see it being re-used by experienced GM's for any starting character not just the pregenerated ones

SUMMARY
-feels just like the opening scenes in Tattooine Cantina down to training wheels for RPGs
-everything you need to get started
-evening's worth of entertainment, but expandable
-wish they had a sturdier box (if you want go to rpggeek.com and search for my thread on how I reboxed the game for display)

Definitely pick this up if you love Star Wars or feel comfortable introducing curious beginners to RPG's.

Game on!",4.0
"I am not sure how familiar all of the viewers are going to be with this game and the genre.  If you are an experienced table-top role-player, feel free to skip the introductory bits up-front.

This is a role-playing game (as opposed to a board or card game).  Most of the Star Wars games released over the past few years have fallen into the board or card game categories.  While board games and card games allow all of the players to participate in the game in the same way, most role-playing games to include this one require one of the players to take the role of the Gamemaster.  The Gamemaster or GM has to prepare and run the opposition for the other players (generally 2-4 other folks who are trying to accomplish some goal proposed by the GM).

The first caveat is that if the players have not participated in a table-top role-playing game (RPG) previously then there might be some surprises and a learning curve associated with this game.  Kids can be playing Risk(tm) out of the box in twenty to thirty minutes.  Star Wars: Edge of the Empire (SWEoE) will take the novice GM at least 4-6 hours to learn the rules and understand the system.  The best way to learn SWEoE is probably to find a local hobby shop and have someone who has some RPG experience step the newcomers through the process.

If you're an old hand at RPGs, this is the place to jump back in.

On to the setting, well, the setting is George Lucas' Star Wars universe.  Most folks will be familiar with the basics of the setting.

The rule books, source material, pictures, etc. in the boxed set, have familiar icons and scenes.

The game mechanics themselves do not have much of a Star Wars flavor to them.

That is not good or bad; it just is.  There are some Pros to that.  If you are looking for a game that allows you to tap into the popularity of Star Wars, but you do not want to be constrained by ""Star Wars canon"" then this game offers a huge benefit over past incarnations of Star Wars RPGs (SWRPGs).

The main Con is that if you picked up this game to play out scenes similar to those found in the movies, books, magazines, cartoons, etc. then you can do that, but the rules do not lead you back to the Star Wars universe.  The GM is going to have to create that feel him or herself.  That is OK, but folks should understand that going into the game.

The system uses the Fantasy Flight Games with specialized dice that have four types of results and use a dice pool mechanic.  I first became familiar with it in FFG's Warhammer Fantasy RPG 3rd Ed. (WHFRPG).  The mechanics were exactly the same.  When all is said and done, the roller has to have more successes than failures to win a challenge, and there are other outcomes that add flavor to the results.

It is a nice mechanic and adds to the excitement around the gaming table.

My second caveat is that you have to have the special FFG dice to play the game, and you will need additional dice fairly fast.  If you are willing to invest a little capital in the game that is OK.  The existing components will take you through two to three sessions with some stretching.

The progression/skill improvement mechanic was a little different, but if you played WHFRPG then SWRPG will be an easy transition.

Onto the materials ... like all FFG components, everything in the box is high quality and looks fantastic.  The counters are high quality.

All in all, this is a very nice FFG product.  If you enjoyed WHFRPG 3rd Ed. and like Star Wars then this product will be a hit with you.

If you are a hard core, dyed in the wool Star Wars fan who is thinking about picking this up to complete a Star Wars collection or improve your understanding of canon then this product is probably going to be light for your tastes.  It is a starter set after-all, but if FFG follows form then the supplements will be well worth the price.

Finally, if you have never played a table-top RPG before, and this is your planned entree, then I highly recommend that you find some experienced players to help step you through the process.  This is not Risk or Monopoly, and you will get out of the game what you invest in it in terms of time and attention.

"The concept for the game is really inventive, even years later.  But there are some dominant strategies and you'll find yourself banning them once you discover them, or else the game loses some of its fun.  Ban deck searching cards from the start, just because they slow the game down.",4.0
"Well, I received this game for Christmas, thought I would love it, played it, and immediately hated it. I came here and wrote a fairly hasty review, but I felt I was fair. Well, I'm updating my review now, and I have to say, this game is actually quite fun. There's quite a bit of detail and customization to be had with the decks, and it still has all the references to stuff I love (like Aliens!).

That said, you should not expect to buy this game and immediately understand it. The rulebook isn't very helpful at all. Even watching the tutorial video that they have on YouTube isn't all that helpful because it skips over important details. Honestly, the rulebook is the biggest flaw with the game in that it will not truly teach you how to play. If you read it and play a few games, though, you'll get it.

Also, the rulebook will tell you that beginners should play as Jinteki and Shaper decks. Don't listen to this. It's a lie. The Shaper deck is pretty good for beginners, I suppose (since there's lots of money), but the Jinteki deck is for more advanced players since almost all their cards require bluffing. And that's not so bad, right? Except beginners don't know how to bluff. That's only something that can come with experience. A novice who plays as Jinteki will feel paralyzed and unable to do anything while the Shaper stomps all over them. Instead of Jinteki, pick any of the other  corporate decks. You'll definitely have a much better experience.",4.0
"While I love truly balanced games, asymmetrical games can be very fun as well, and that's what Netrunner is. One player plays a megacorporation trying to score agenda points and/or kill the pesky runner, played by the other player, who is trying to hack into the corporation's servers and cause as much damage as he can while attempting to steal corp agenda. This game is strictly limited to TWO players as a result. The rulebook does a fairly good job of explaining things, and includes a helpful flow of play diagram on the back which you will probably want to leave face up the first couple of times you play. The quality of components is high as well; sleeves will likely be required if you care about keeping the cards in good condition, but this is true of most any card game. The tokens are made of very thick cardstock and will keep for a long time. Also, if you like to punch things out, congrats, you're in luck when opening this box! While there are enough baggies included to both sequester all of the tokens, and initially separate the corp/runner cards, you will probably want to invest in something else to store the cards. This is doubly true if you are interested in building different decks. That being said, the box is more than large enough to both accommodate not only the included cards, but also cards you may purchase in the future. You will just probably need to get a little creative as the included cardboard support can probably only hold about double the cards you're initially supplied with (if you removed it you could fit about 5 times that many, but they'd be free to fly around inside).

A quick note: For those unaware what an LCG is, it is a format that Fantasy Flight has chosen to move to for their card games. Instead of booster packs containing a random assortment of cards from an expansion (sorted by rarity that give the cards differing collectible and monetary value), they release new material in 20 card increments, in packs that contain a fixed list of cards, with 3 copies of each (3 being the maximum number of copies you are allowed to include of any one card in a deck). This allows the game to grow and the environment to change without requiring you to spend a fortune to keep up (like with Magic: The Gathering). The expansion packs still have a MSRP of $15, however, so it isn't exactly cheap either.

To return to gameplay: the runner and corporation are governed by similar but differing rules. For example, the corporation can perform 3 actions per turn, but always draws a card each turn. The runner can perform 4 actions but doesn't draw a card unless he uses an action to do so (this is a nice bit of theme attached to an interesting decision - I can totally see a hacker exclaiming 'I don't have time for this!' while staying up all night to complete a run). The runner attempts to access corporation servers which include the corp's hand, draw deck, and discard pile, as well as any additional server they create in order to try to score agenda points or host valuable resources. The corporation guards these servers with ICE, which have a wide range of effects that the runner must use certain installed programs to defeat. What becomes interesting is that while the runner plays their cards face up, the corporation plays their cards face DOWN, so what is on the board is a mystery. The corporation can and often will attempt to bluff the runner into believing one type of card is another, and since running can be expensive, in theory this can force some tough decisions. After playing for some time, in practice many times it can be obvious for the runner what is going on.

There are three different runner factions, and 4 different corporation factions. They all have a unique feel, and they are all adequately represented in the base set, which gives it a good degree of replayability. I will say that the base decks as they are suggested in the rule book (i.e. including only the cards of one faction and the neutral cards) will result in some matches being completely one sided. You will want to tinker with and substitute some cards (after reading the deckbuilding guide if you are new to this kind of game) in order to improve the quality of the gaming experience. Even after doing so, some of the corporation builds can feel woefully slow, it's frustrating to be a supposed megacorporation and feel like you have absolutely no money! I'd say at this point the metagame highly favors the runner, but if you're just looking for something to play with friends and don't have interest in the game being absolutely balanced, this is definitely worth picking up, even if you don't have any intention of purchasing any of the additional expansions.",4.0
"The game is awesome, incredibly fun to play, specially if you are a SciFi fan (more so if you enjoy the Cyberpunk sub-genre). The atmosphere is simply perfect and makes me feel like I'm on a William Gibson's novel. Gone is the randomness of booster packs, or exorbitant prices for that last rare you are chasing after. Coming from a Magic: The Gathering background, that was a huge plus for me as I was looking to get into card games again, but with wife and children now, can't really put up with the barrage of new cards that flood the Magic world every few months (more specifically, the financial aspect of keeping decks up-to-date for Friday night matches against friends or unknowns in card game stores).

Another huge plus is the fact that one Core Set is enough for 2 players to enjoy the game for a while. There are enough variety for at least 24 unique matches, not even considering deck customization. That's quite a lot considering you would barely have a single badly done deck of most (if not all) traditional CCG (a bit of unfair comparison, given Netrunner is a LCG).

My only negative feedback about this game, is not even about the game itself, it's about the Core Set specifically. It does not contain 3 copies of each card. The are quite a lot of cards with 2 copies of each (more than half) and 11 cards with a single copy of each. Firstly, I would love this information to be more explicitly stated in the box or the publisher's site (there is a single mention about unique cards, the Identity ones, which doesn't really matter).

If you have any background in other card games, you know that deck building is perhaps one of the most engaging aspects of this type of game. That's precisely where having the max allowed number of cards permitted becomes significant. The missing cards (either missing one or two) happens to be, unsurprisingly, some of the most powerful (specially some of the cards that you only get one copy).

While a second set isn't absurdly expensive, again, compared to traditional card games, the fact that you have no alternative other than getting an entire core set is just a bit stupid (if anything else, for the waste of resources involved). At the bare minimum, a complementary set with just the missing singles/doubles would be nice (and slightly more friendly to the environment and the space in my house). Unfortunately, your only option is a full core set.

If you are looking to have 3 of the ""rare"" (or single cards), then prepare to bite the bullet and get three core sets. Granted this won't be an issue to every player, it's still a sad aspect. It wouldn't be so bad if there were at least a reasonable alternative other than buying multiple copies of the core set.

Thankfully, this only affects the Core set so far, as all the other expansions, including the deluxe one have 3 copies of each card included.

Having said all that, it's worth every cent of the buy and it's a must for any fan of the genres involved.",4.0
"This is a great game.  I had been trying to buy a copy of it at my local shop forever, and they couldn't keep it in stock for more than 12 hours, so eventually I ordered it online.  It was well worth it.  It takes awhile to get comfortable with the rules, and the asymmetrical nature of the gameplay makes the rules seem like they are overly complex, but once you get past the semi-steep learning curve the gameplay is fast, fun, and strategic.  I would recommend this game to anyone, but avoid trying to teach it to children.",4.0

"The dice system that was originally used in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay has been upgraded.  So that's nice.

The beginner game includes pre-generated characters and a short adventure.  Both are designed to introduce you to the rules and do a good job of that. It's designed for four people and a GM.

There is a free web download for the next adventure.

The only issue we had was that some of the rules aren't fully fleshed out (like encumbrance and other things) so as a gm it took me a while to invent my own rules.  This will change with the core rule book release I would expect.

But 30 bucks is a total steal for this box set.",4.0
"i enjoyed the adventure and roleplay aspects very much.

My only complain would be the lack of more content, i understand this is a beginner's startup, but it would do well to include more adventures. There's a free one on their website too.",4.0
This is a very nice introduction into a Star Wars RPG.  It comes with everything you will need to run a beginning adventure and looks to be a lot of fun.,4.0
"I like Fantasy Flight's Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd edition, the precursor to this Star Wars system, which I also like a lot (I have this and the beta rulebook). I am also a sucker for boxed sets in general, so this was right in my wheelhouse. That said, yeah, this particular box is less than it could have, and should have, been.

The system is great. It's cinematic and narrative and easily tweaked if you find combat too deadly or not. More importantly to me, this ruleset shares a quality that WFRP3 has that I think is underrated in modern RPGs, which is that the game is designed to the specific setting and isn't trying to be a generic science-fiction or space opera game (in the same way WFRP3 is designed to the Warhammer setting and not as a generic fantasy setting). You can, with some work on your part, modify either system to suit your specific setting needs, but I like that the base rules have a specific type of game experience in a specific setting in mind. In the case of Edge of the Empire, it feels to me like they're aiming for a combo of Knights of the Old Republic (the BioWare computer rpg for Xbox and PC) and the original trilogy, which I think is terrific (there is as little mention of anything prequel related as I think they could possibly get away with, which is another plus as far as I'm concerned). More specifically with the beta rules and this basic set, they're setting you up to play (fairly desperate -- see my comments on the Obligation rules below) smuggler, bounty hunter, trader type characters operating a spaceship and trying to keep it running while staying one step ahead of their pasts as they adventure around the Outer Rim territories. What they don't do with these rules is make the mistake other designers have made of simply mapping generic D&D classes to sci-fi/space opera/Star Wars, or immediately throwing full Jedi Knight player character rules at you, or having your characters in the thick of the rebellion alongside Luke and Han (which may sound awesome but gets very fanfic very fast).

If you're familiar with WFRP3, another plus is that these rules simplify and improve upon those rules quite a bit. On the other hand, though, I actually miss the action cards, which I really liked. But if you want you can go buy some blank playing cards and print your own action cards for the characters' active talents (which is what has replaced action cards for the most part) onto sticker paper and cut 'em out, stick 'em on your blank cards, and there you go. I also am not as crazy about the more constrained Destiny Point system that has replaced the more open and free-flowing Fortune Point system that allowed the GM to reward players and entice them to take chances by rewarding them with Fortune Points. Instead you roll up a number of Light Side Destiny Points and Dark Side Destiny Points at the beginning of each session; when players spend their Points they go to the GM and become Dark Side Points, and when the GM spends his for the bad guys they go to the players and become Light Side Points.

One of the best new mechanics in Edge of the Empire is the Obligation system. Each player character has one or more Obligations (debts, oaths, enemies who are hunting them, etc.) that have a chance of impacting events each session. When they do, they negatively impact the characters, and if the PCs don't take steps to deal with these Obligations when they pop up those negative modifiers get worse. If you're group is less gamist, the GM can just handle Obligations more organically as suits his or her needs.

Like WFRP3, Edge of the Empire uses special custom dice. I love custom dice, so I love this. I just hope Fantasy Flight Games does a better job of keeping the Star Wars dice in print than they did the Warhammer dice (seriously Fantasy Flight, WTH??). They do have dice rolling apps for iOS and Android out for both Warhammer and Star Wars, and I really like them. In fact, as a GM, I'll say that if you're GMing you should only use the dice rolling app. It allows you to put together dice pools for your NPCs, bad guys, and monsters faster, and it instantly gives you the tallies for successes, failures, advantages, setbacks, etc. But as a player I prefer the tactile experience of rolling actual dice, which is very satisfying with these systems -- provided Fantasy Flight makes enough dice and keeps them in stock.

The materials that you do get in the Beginner Box are of excellent quality as you'd expect (although the eponymous box itself is disappointingly flimsy). The problem is there's just not quite enough to make you feel good about spending more than $20 on this (even though the dice themselves will retail for $15 when they're sold separately in a month or two). And of course as others have noted, the Beginner Box lacks character creation and real advancement rules, and only gives you four pregenerated characters to use (although you can download two more for free from the FFG website, it's disappointing they didn't include the nice high quality character folios for these two characters in the actual box). The tutorial adventure that comes with the box set is indeed a total lead-you-by-the-nose experience, but it's actually excellent in that it's designed for the GM and the players to play through the scenario together without knowing any of the rules first. I mean that even the GM doesn't really need to know anything before you get started, because it's written so that each encounter along the way introduces you to a new rule concept and shows you how to use it, for the players and the GM. So you could open this box, read a couple sheets of introductory info in about 20 minutes, and then immediately start playing the game with your players (although you're not really *playing* the game so much as learning the rules in a fun way that kind of simulates actual gameplay). If you and your players are veteran roleplayers and that's too boring or constrictive for you, an experienced GM can easily read the whole tutorial and then just run it off the cuff as a normal adventure.

There's one other thing that's a personal nit that I'm going to pick, and that's the character and creature (and ship) counters. These are round counters made of thick, good quality cardboard -- the kind of board game bits that FFG does so well. But they're made to just lay flat on the encounter maps, whereas WFRP3 came with rectangular counters that you stood up in clear plastic stands. I love those as an attractive and easy to use (and store) alternative to minis. Now of course you can go hop on ebay or one of the collectibles websites and get a ton of Star Wars Minis from the WotC game (I looked, and basically any mini with a lightsaber or that depicts one of the recognizable name characters is kind of stupidly expensive, and everything else is cheap; so you can easily get a large collection of good quality painted minis for your game quickly and at a very reasonable cost). But I really wish the Beginner Box came with the WFRP3 character/creature/vehicle counters with the stands. If you have those stands, you can use them with the round counters, but it's not as cool as the larger, rectangular WFRP3 counters. Oh well. My group will probably just end up using the Star Wars Minis for characters and the new X-Wing minis game minis for the spaceships.

Bottom line is that if you're eager to start playing this very cool game right away and you understand that it doesn't include character creation rules or full character advancement rules, this box set is worth getting even if it would feel like a better buy if it came with a little more stuff. I couldn't wait, so I bought it, and I knew what I was getting and I'm happy. But if you don't feel the need to scratch your Edge of the Empire itch that badly it probably does make more sense to simply wait another month or two and get the full rules when they come out.",4.0
I love this game! The strategy is deep and the extra packs keeps it fresh and interesting. My only complaint is that the base set has a few cards that are limited in count. Where as it's legal by the rules to have 3 of any given card in your deck some cards are only present in counts of one or two in this base set. If you get really serious about this game you may find your self contemplating buying this three times!,4.0
Started to play after getting tired of Magic the Gathering. The mechanics are deep and very complex. It took me and my brother about 3 hours to go through and learn all the rules and about 5 games before we felt comfortable with what we were doing to began branching out our strategies. We were both were very fluent with Magic and there are similar concepts that helped us learn Netrunner but be prepared to learn lots of new terminology. If you and a buddy are willing to invest the time you will find its really fun.,4.0
"Star Wars: The Card Game - 2 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 30-60 Minutes

I won't lie...I had to read the instruction manual a few times to get a grasp on what was going on.  The hardest part was understanding how all of the cards were organized, though once I saw how the objective and five accompanying cards tied together, it became a bit more clear.  Each card has a deck identifier number on it, as well as an X of 6 identifier, which allowed me to clearly see which cards belonged to what deck when organizing them.  These little details went a long way in helping to keep the learning curve manageable.

Having played and reviewed the two Star Trek Deck Building games by Bandai, I was surprised that the card art was hand drawn as opposed to being actual movie stills.  I have to say though that the card art is exceptional and full of theme.  The hand drawn art almost looks like the real thing...a tribute to the artists who helped to make this game possible.

I thought it was pretty gutsy for the designers of the game to include two different objectives for either side.  The Dark Side has the luxury of being able to wait things out, for their Death Star tracker will advance on their turn no matter what.  If they happen to gain the Dark Side advantage via the Balance of the Force, all the better.  The Light Side is practically forced to go on the offense and destroy those objectives before the Death Star tracker reaches its end.  The good news is that both sides play fairly different, giving players a unique experience depending on the side they choose.

Just to name a few examples, Vinnie (12) took control of the Imperial Fleet while I took ownership of the Rebel Alliance for our first game.  I had a lot of objective and command cards that did extra damage to enemy objectives.  I found myself able to swoop in and do a lot of damage, though I had to remember to pay attention to each card's special ability to implement them.  Vinnie, on the other hand, had more resources at his disposal and brought in the Devastator (a powerful capital ship) and a TIE Bomber.  He wiped out one objective with a superlaser card and two more with his ships on following turns.  Even though I had Force control throughout the majority of the game, he brought his Death Star tracker from zero to nine in no time flat.  If it wasn't for special abilities and Force priority, I would have lost.

Overall, the experience was a positive one.  Our first few games took much longer than the average play time called for, mainly because we were still trying to get used to how the cards interacted with one another.  To that end, you'll definitely want to allot yourself some extra time during your first few games.  It becomes much easier to play the more times you cycle through the cards you're used to seeing.  Battles also take a little time to get used to, though I must commend Fantasy Flight for publishing a twenty minute video tutorial, which I linked below.  I highly recommend watching it before attempting to decipher the manual.

""Star Wars: The Card Game"" takes a little effort to understand, but is well worth the trouble.  I really enjoyed seeing the iconic characters duking it out, though I did find it odd that ships and characters were treated on an equal level.  This simplifies things a bit by eliminating the complexities of space and ground combat, so I found that I didn't mind as much.  Still, I chuckled a bit when characters like Yoda went up against capital ships like the Devastator...though knowing Yoda, I wouldn't count him out of the fight completely.  Great production values and a lot of room for expansion will keep this game exciting game after game.

Speaking of expansions, there are a number of expansion sets available that provide more decks for players to use.  Some even expand the game to three or four players, while others expand on the underrepresented Smugglers and Spies / Scum and Villainy factions.  Before spending any cash on them however, I'd highly recommend giving the base game a go first to see if this is a game that you can get into.  It's safe to say however that Vinnie and I most certainly did.",4.0

"Android: Netrunner overall is a fun and diverse experience. Asymmetric play, racing to score agendas vs. burning your opponent, traps and timing attacks make this a welcome departure from the mass combat play style of Magic and other card games.

However, the ""Living Card Game"" format does not really save players any money over the collectible card format in the long run. Type-A players will keep buying more and more expansion packs, effectively forcing casual players to keep up or lose out to more powerful cards and strategies. Also, both the core set and the data packs have a lot of spam cards. Net Shield, Bullfrog, and Snowflake? Waste of art talent, space, and money.",4.0
"For those who loved Magic, but want more bang for their buck and don't mind a hacker sci-fi theme, this could be a good product. If your still interested, and wanted Magic to be a bit more complicated, a little bit longer, and allow for a bit of bluffing, this is a GREAT game!

You will only be able to create one varied hacker & one varied corp deck at a time with this set though, so you will likely want at least a couple $12 expansions after a few games.",4.0
"I was excited when i heard Dark Horse was making Game of Thrones figures, love everything about the show
these ""figures"" are more so statues, with no moving parts, except for Dany's wooden chest opens and closes.
the packaging is great, perfect to display, or if you want to open, its completely collector friendly, which is a huge plus to me
one negative about the packaging is with Dany, they put a twisty tie around her waist, and it was really tight and it cut into her rubber/soft plastic dress and leaves permanent dents, which isn't horrible, but its a let down.
the face on the final product is much too long and the likeness is lost, doesn't look anything like Emilia Clarke to me
her dress and hair are made of softer plastic/rubber which is a great touch, it even seems like she has a complete sculpted body under her dress, she has legs and painted shoes
her eggs and chest are really great, the chest looks perfect, and doesn't look like a cheap accessory, she holds the eggs pretty well.
the base has a spot reserved for the chest, a rectangle in the sand where the chest is saposta sit, but the chest is bigger than the spot so it hangs off the base a bit, it would have been better to me if the base was just a bit bigger and the chest really fit in the reserved spot. also the draping of her dress from her arm gets in the way of the base which is annoying.

this is a good sized figure and i actually think it is worth $20, but i wouldn't pay much more than that

"Netrunner is a very fun, complex card game. You can find out all about it from many sources, so I'm not going to reiterate the basics. There are a few points I would make for anyone thinking of buying this game.

-The expansions are cheap but very fun if you're serious. Only the first expansion is really vital (What Lies Ahead) as it gives the corp factions some much needed agenda cards. Beyond that none are necessary.

-It's a hard game to teach. There are a lot of rules, a lot of strategy, and once you master the basics then you add in the complexity of building your own deck. You'll need friends who are serious gaming to find good opponents.

-To offset the last point, there is a way to play this game over the net through the OCTGN. If you like the game but can't find enough opponents, a few google searches will set you up with a platform to play the game online.

The only reason I don't give this game five stars is because it's a hard game to find opponents for locally unless you are part of a big tabletop gaming scene already. If you don't have access to that, the online OCTGN platform is great, but getting it up and running is a chore. So while the game itself is fantastic, the difficulty in playing it regularly keeps it from being perfect.",4.0
"I have been playing Magic the Gathering for a while and I love Star Wars, so when this came out it was a no-brainer for me. What the other reviewers said about it is true: great art, interesting rules, nice ""flavor"", all that. What really surprised me is how deeply strategical the game becomes after you get used to the rules. Reading the manual and watching the video tutorials led me to believe it was just mindless combat, but you have to plan each attack, mind the balance of the force, manage resources and really think ahead of your opponent. The fact that the strategy for each side is very different makes it much more interesting. The way it ties in with the movies is nice as well.
I will definitely buy the expansion packs.",4.0

"This is more of a cautionary tale than a review, but I feel that potential customers must be made aware of 3(THREE) things before they make a purchase decision:

1)  This game is a card game in the same vein as Magic: the Gathering, Thunderstone, and Pokemon. This is not a ""one-and-done"" purchase. The game gets better the more cards you have. But there is also a problem with this...

2) You need more than just one box. Because it can be customized(as the above examples can) and because Netrunner has VERY SPECIFIC deckbuilding rules, it must be noted that the decks inside the box can be best describled as ""barely playable"", especially on the Corporation side of the ball. With only the contents of ONE(1) box at your disposal, merely CHOOSING WHICH CORPORATION you wish to play LOCKS UP TO TEN CARDS in your deck that you CANNOT CHANGE while maintaining a rules-legal deck. When the game premiered at 2012 GenCon, it sold out in minutes as people were buying 2 & 3 boxes at a time JUST to be able to customize their decks for play.

3) Unlike other card games as above, this is STRICTLY a two-player affair. No amount of rules adjustment will allow for more that two players to play at a time. On the same side, no amount of rules adjustment will allow you to play this by yourself. Before purchase, ensure (as I did) you have AT LEAST one other person to play this game with you, or ensure your moth ball supply is up to par.

As a side note, I recommend www.amazon.com/Android-Netrunner-Lcg-What-Ahead/dp/1616615451/ref=pd_sim_t_1 as of the available data pack expansions, it contains the most new Corporation cards to better customize your deck (side-side note: as of this posting, Amazon.com has none available, and no re-stock information.

"This is a great game.  Plays quickly.  That there is an expansion coming out that fleshes out the affiliations more makes this game shine even more.  The deck building mechanic may not be for all.

"With the X-Wing Miniatures Game and the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game already on the shelves, Fantasy Flight Games hit us again with Star Wars: The Card Game.

Star Wars: The Card Game (SWTCG) is a Living Card Game (LCG). Like a collectible card game, a LCG is a game that allows for expanding card pools, enabling players to build customised decks, but does away with the rare and promotion cards that would give a player an edge; no longer will a game be decided on who spent the most money on the best cards. LCGs keep the games competitive and balanced.

The SWTCG core set is for two players - so you can get playing pretty much straight away - and comes in an attractive box 30 x 30 cm box of hard cardboard stock making it quite robust. The collage of images on the box is from the original trilogy, Episodes IV to VI, which is the era this game concentrates on. As with all Fantasy Flight Games products, the presentation is top notch, but it's a large box that's filled with padding; inside, the cards are stored in a narrow trench behind two pieces of card and only take up about one-third of the interior, and under these pieces of supporting card - the box is 7 cm deep - is nothing. It seems like a lot of wasted space for what is essentially a collection of 117 playing cards and some tokens. It certainly grabs the attention, mind you, and that's what counts. I'm a massive Star Wars fan and it looks great on the shelf with my other stuff.

Inside the box you get; 24 cards (117 light side, 117 dark side, and 6 Force cards), 1 Death Star dial, nearly 100 damage, shield and focus tokens,1 Balance of the Force token and the Rulebook. As soon as you open the box, the first thing you see is a sheet guiding you to a video tutorial on how to play SWTCG on the Fantasy Flight Games website - if you want to skip to that right now and avoid my game description below, then go to [...] you can download the rules form the same web page if you want to have a good read. Next is the 32-page booklet of rules, which is very nicely illustrated and explains the rules clearly and concisely. The tokens are push-out thick card of good quality.

And them we come to the jewel in the crown, the cards themselves. Each card is beautifully illustrated with scenes, locations and characters from the movies. Each image is wonderfully reproduced on each of the glossy 6 x 9 cm cards, and in there is the legendary Ralph McQuarrie, the man who designed the Star Wars universe and that, of course, put a huge smile on my face. Each card is extremely well illustrated and would look great in a collector's folder. There's more than 100 of them, and with other packs out to support the core game on the way - `The Desolation of Hoth' and `The Search for Skywalker' - things can only get better. This is a Fantasy Flight Games strength being turned up to eleven; their artwork and presentation has always been some of the best in the business and here are artists illustrating some of the best known images in the world. It's safe to say that the artists have excelled themselves and should be very proud, as the atmosphere and energy of the movies has been captured. There are a couple of images that aren't 100 percent, but overall the quality is impressive. Most impressive.

So, to the game. The video tutorial or the rulebook download will explain this a thousand times better than I can in the space of this review but the basics of the game are this; as the game progresses the player controlling the Dark Side is already in almost total control of the galaxy and must destroy it's enemies to finally rule over all. The Dark Side has a Death Star dial that is advanced at the beginning of each of turn. If the dial reaches to twelve, then the Dark Side wins.

The player controlling the Light Side can win by destroying three Dark Side objective cards. This takes firepower and this firepower is in the form of Unit Cards, made up of icons of the Star wars universe; characters, creatures, droids, vehicles, and starships. Event cards indicate an unexpected change with unfortunate incidents and other effects. You can enhance your cards with skills, weapons, and other items and there are other cards such as locations that can aid you. The idea is to increase your strategy, which will enable you to strike the objective cards; the quicker you do this the quicker you can launch attacks.

The system is quick and elegant and games can take around an hour. It says on the box 30-60 minutes but my first game took closer to 90 as we got ourselves familiar with the rules, but the following games were around the hour mark;' it depends on how far the Death Star dial gets. It makes for a very intense evening's play and I can easily say that the game is fun and exciting. The counters can get a bit fiddly as the playing table can be covered with focus or damage tokens and the like, which denote which cards are powered or damaged, and one cough or heavy sigh can upset things (I'm not kidding - that did happen). Also, they have to be cleared quite often and it can slow things down, which gets frustrating when the excitement levels are rising.

Star Wars: The Card Game is easy to learn, quick to set up and enjoyable to play. Each game is unique and the tactics you are able to employ are varied. There's a lot of fun to be had with this game as well the gorgeously illustrated cards which would look amazing in anyone's collection, much like the models that Fantasy Flight Games produced for their X-Wing miniatures game. There's flexibility in deck building but then there's always a level playing field. The core set will keep you going for a long time, but the game will need ongoing support to keep the game fresh and exciting.",4.0
"The basic gist of the game is that Dark Side players take control of the Sith, Imperial Navy, or Scum and Villainy, and pit their deck against the Light Side, made up of Jedi, Rebel Alliance or Smugglers and Spies, and then put all their resources towards destroying opponent objectives and skewing the balance of the Force in their favor.  To win, The Light Side must destroy 3 Dark Side objectives, while the Dark Side is trying to advance the Death Star counter to 12 in order to crush their opponents into the ground; it is mainly due to the Death Star counter that makes Star Wars such an easy game to play as it acts as a built in timer that guarantees the game won't last more than 40-60 minutes (except for your first time through, learning the rules).

Deck customization is much more robust here, as players can mix and match any cards they want into their deck, so long as they include the matching objective.  This allowed me to build a killer Sith deck with a few big Star Destroyers thrown in for good measure, while my opponent went more tactical with the Rebel Alliance and just Obi-Wan as a backup Jedi.  Whatever way you choose to play will almost always mirror the tension and drama found in the movies.  My first time through, the Dark Side player was absolutely dominating, advancing the Death Star faster and faster, and slaughtering all my characters.  I finally got a lucky draw that allowed me to resurrect some fallen Jedi and through careful use of resources and a few intense battles, I snatched victory out of the Dark Side's grasp with only 1 turn left before I would have lost.  It was incredibly satisfying and completely exhilarating to say the least, and gave me a rush of emotions I don't normally get from a board/card game.

While it is quite obvious that the Core Set is mainly meant to teach beginners and will be enhanced by future releases, I was a bit disappointed to see that it nearly completely ignores the ""Scum and Villainy"" and ""Smugglers and Scoundrels"" sets of cards.  I realize they couldn't include everything, but since it advertises that you can choose between 6 different factions, I expected to be able to do so right out of the box.

Minor quibbles aside, I'm having a blast with this game and can't recommend it enough.  While it's not as tightly integrated as some other LCGs, it does more to suck you into the universe it represents than nearly any game out there.  With the first two expansions already in the works (""The Desolation of Hoth"" and ""The Search for Skywalker"") it appears that Fantasy Flight Games is planning on supporting this for awhile, so you can buy with confidence that it's not going to be forgotten anytime soon.  Plus, you can pick it up for only $30, so it's not that huge of an investment, and I can almost guarantee that if you're a Star Wars fan, you're gonna love this!",4.0

"This is a reboot of an old collectible card game from 1996, reborn as one of Fantasy Flight's ""Living Card Games,"" which are like collectible card games except that you get (almost, more on that in a minute) all the cards that are available, and there's no such thing as a randomly assorted booster pack. Instead of booster packs with random cards, Fantasy Flight is going to be releasing monthly ""Data Packs"" which will contain 3 copies (the maximum you can have in your deck) of 20 new cards each. So 60 total cards. The idea is that if you keep up with the data packs, you'll always have a full playset of cards, and the only determinate of winning will be skill in deckbuilding and playing, and not who spent the most money to get the best cards. I'm a big fan of the Living Card Game idea.

One of the biggest negatives about this product is that it does not actually contain a full playset of cards. Each of the data packs from now on will have 3 copies of every card, but for some reason in this base set, most cards only have 1 or 2 copies included. This means that in order to have a full playset, you'd actually have to buy the core set three times. This is unfortunate, and a bizarre choice on Fantasy Flight's end, seemingly a transparent ploy to get more money out of their dedicated fanbase. It's too bad.

On to the game itself. It's excellent. One of the most fun things about the game is the physical representation of a cyberpunk computer reality. The corporation's cards are set up like servers, complete with ICE in front of them protecting them. The runner's cards are set up like a ""rig"" computer, with hardware and software cards that get installed and take up memory units. Combat, such as it is, is unique and different from any other dueling card game I've played. The game also requires players to interact with each other. The runner wins by stealing cards from the corporation, and the corporation is forced to draw each turn, meaning that they always have a supply of cards for the runner to steal. This is fantastic game design. Much has been made online about the bluffing in Netrunner, and it definitely exists, though it's not as subtle or integral as in a game like poker. The corp plays their cards face down, and the runner doesn't know what they are. Some cards are points for the runner to steal, others are potentially deadly traps. That's about where the bluffing ends, but even a little bit of it is fun.

One thing I don't like about the game is that after a while, it feels very deterministic. I've had games of Magic: the Gathering where I held off with one life point and managed to defeat my opponent. This sort of thing would never really happen in Netrunner. Once the game has gone on for a little while, it's obvious who is going to win. All the bluffing and card drawing in the world won't help you once your opponent has amassed enough resources and cards to hammer their way through to win. It's not a huge downside, but it's there, and I hope it will be addressed somewhat with future Data Packs.

Another problem I have with the game is that there are certain, somewhat random, things that can happen that end the game immediately and quite anticlimatically. A runner can encounter a trap the corp has set and die instantly, even fairly on in the game. The corp can have a runner look at the top three cards of his deck on literally the second turn, and have the runner end the game then when the top three cards contain enough points to win. These things are somewhat unlikely, but when they happen it makes the game feel a little silly and weak.

Another gripe with all of Fantasy Flight's card games is that their cards are just too thin and flimsy. They clearly skimp on printing costs. Again, just a fact of life if you want to play these games, but it cheapens the experience.

Overall though, this is one of the better two-player games out there. I like it more than Magic: the Gathering (a game I've played for over a decade) for many reasons. I wouldn't say I like it better than Warhammer: Invasion, the other Fantasy Flight LCG that I'm familiar with, but it's definitely different enough to be worth a look. Recommended.",4.0
"Very fun, nice job porting the original. The option to make a deck or use pre-generated decks is nice. Allows for new players to get in to the game very quickly, but once people know it being able to mix up decks gives good replay ability.",4.0
The game is fun once you get over the initial learning curve. Not for those who want to pick up a game the first time and play immediately. Nice to have a game designed for two players only.,4.0
"Nice little figure. Doesn't move, though the eggs/chest can be moved around. I've kept mine in the box, so I can't speak to the durability of the figure and such, but she's quite pretty for a small plastic figure and looks nice with the rest of my collection. For the price, a decent buy.",4.0
"Netrunner is a card game for 2 people. It plays in an asymmetrical manner, meaning each person plays a different way with slightly different rules and effects depending on if they are the corporation or the runner.

In a nutshell, the corporation builds itself up by placing agendas on the field as servers, and guarding the servers with ice (defensive firewalls) until they can score that agenda. Runners build up their power, and make runs (or attack) the corporations servers, trying to steal agendas to score. On the surface it seems like a simple concept, but after playing a few games you realize that there is more strategy involved than you initially expected; I imagine that people who rate this game poorly haven't played enough to realize this, and chalk it up to being a luck based game. While I concede that any card game has a bit of luck involved in what you're dealt, I compare this to something like Magic The Gathering. Ever wonder why it's the same group of people who sit at the finals each year? As with this game, there's a lot of strategy in being able to play the hand you're dealt.

The game recommends playing your first several games with 2 specific decks. And while I'm sure that they are balanced to play well together, and cover many situations, I found that overall the corporation didn't feel as powerful as the runner. It always felt like the corporation was on defense, and the runner was in control of the game. Even on games where the corporation won, it was due more to the runner making a mistake, then on any active part of the corporation player. The game is also heavily skewed to having a good opening hand. As the corporation, if you don't start with any ice, the runner can almost immediately make runs against your hand or your deck. In one game, I had scored more than half the points needed to win by the end of my 3rd turn. Likewise, if the runner doesn't draw any programs, they will be unable to break through the simplest of ice programs the corporation has to defend itself. The rules state that each player may take 1 mulligan (or redraw), but then must keep the hand they have, but I'm not sure that incorporating a house rule similar to other card games(where you can mulligan any number of times, keeping 1 less card in hand each time you do) wouldn't be more fair to balance out potential poor starting hands.

During my first few games with my brother-in-law, we had to Google the effects of several cards, as their text wasn't clear or easily understood. Add to that the sheer number of keywords and abilities available, and it can make for a very steep learning curve. You *will* be making extensive use of the 36 page rulebook during your first several games.

The physical quality of the game pieces is good, but like any card based game (Dominion, 7 Wonders, etc) if you play often you will want to invest in some card sleeves to protect the game. Fantasy Flight makes sleeves that fit this perfectly (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clear-Sleeves-Standard-Card-Game-Pack/dp/1589945158/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clear Sleeves: Standard Card Game Pack</a>), and you will need 6 of the ""grey"" or ""standard"" sleeves to fully sleeve up the starting decks (2.5"" X 3.5""). And while the base game comes with everything that 2 people need to play (3 runner decks, 4 corporation decks, and many neutral cards for both sides), Fantasy Flight Games will be releasing monthly update packs that will add to the scope and depth of the game.",4.0

"My original impressions of Rune Age were that it was OK, but a little bit thin. It has more width than depth. But as time went on i actually grew to like the little sucker. You really have to think and look for card combos, and it's surprising how many there are. Timing is important as well.

Oath and Anvil adds just enough to the game to really complete it imo. More options for the original four factions, more types of neutral cards, two whole new factions (orcs and dwarves), more cards for the original scenarios, two more scenarios (one of which is a Rune Age version of Descent)

Oath and Anvil adds both width and depth to Rune Age. The small, sturdy box it ships in fits right into Rune Age's box which is a cool little bonus. (Assuming you discard the worthless FFG inserts like i do)

So yeah, if you like the idea of liking Rune Age more than you already do... thumbs up!!!",4.0
This one is well made however the figure leans foreword slightly & did put me of somewhat. Out of all the figures this one i thought was the one that needed some more work but she does fit & looks good in the collection,4.0

"This is a very well made figure but you need to keep in mind that the photo used to advertise it is obviously of the prototype and not of an actual production figure. In other words, the face in the photo is a reasonably good likeness of Emilia Clarke, the actress playing Daenerys. In my opinion, however, the actual figure that arrived at my home has the face of an attractive, generic blonde, butt it's not particularly Emilia Clarke....  If you are looking for a generic figure of Daenerys, you will be quite pleased with what you receive; if you want a figure that is immediately recognizable as Emilia in the role of Daenerys, you will probably be a little disappointed.

A suggestion: the trunk comes as a separate piece as do the three eggs. For your own sanity, do not open the packaging while standing on an oriental carpet. If you drop one of the eggs, it will take you forever to find t!",4.0
It's a great addition to my collection!,4.0
"As someone already stated, the face is much thinner than the one depicted for this product. Doesn't look anything like the actress who plays Daenerys. That being said, I still love the figurine. I took her out of box to display.  From a distance, she looks great. Getting up close, of course, ruins the magic since the thinner face is not very pretty and the paint job is mediocre.

The figurine is soft and pliant. Love the eggs (although one of them was nearly impossible to get out of the plastic) and love the fact that you can pop one into the figurine's cupped hands. The platform which the figurine is attached to has an indent where the box is meant to be placed.

I would buy other figurines, but I would prefer to choose after seeing in person. I chose from one of two Daenerys figurines at my local Barnes and Noble. Neither Jon Snow was very good, so I chose not to purchase one of them.",4.0
Figure is great but the box it cake with is torn at the top and this was NOT stated in the description. Not pleased about that at ALL.,4.0
For what you're getting here this is a very good price if you compare to other figures for just a few more dollars you get a finely sculpted detailed figure though technically it's more of a statue but most people that buy game of thrones figures are probably getting them to display and not to actually play with anyway but this statue is nicely detailed is about 9 inches and comes with removable dragon eggs and chest my biggest gripe is that the face sculpt does not resemble the actress Emilia Clark at all really that goes the same for the game of thrones legacy line of action figures for some reason these figure companies can not get her likeness right other than that a great collectible and comes with my recommendation if you're a game of thrones fan,4.0

Good but expensive to field in game. I would recommend no more than two.,4.0
"I bought this solely for the X wing pilots and the Astromechs. The R5 P9 and R3 A2 droids alone cost between $15 and $20 depending on where you look. What I did find was that most people in my area don't have or haven't looked at the Pilot cards so they don't know what to expect when you show up for a casual game. I would not recommend these pilots in a tournament setting (personal preference), however R3 A2 as a stress bot on a Y wing is still strong these days.",4.0
"The model looks absolutely stunning, but I must admit I am not exactly wowed by the game play. My biggest problem with this craft is how difficult it is to use offensively. By far the most effective means I have found is simply to use it as a battering ram, but because of the annoyingly low shields it cant keep that up for long. The other way is to use the jam action to stress enemy ships and then use the slicer tools to deal damage to stressed ships, but this is annoyingly complicated. Probably the best option for comparison is the imperial assault carrier, witch has a hard point and the nifty effect of actually being able to carry fighters. I suppose the trade off is it is considerably cheaper but if you equip the combat retrofit it cost the same as the imperial carrier. It looks really cool but for me its just been a glorified battering ram.",4.0
"Always best to buy these expansions online. Pity key X-Wing Miniature's rebel strategies rely on a few cards from this larger expansion. Though I haven't played an ""epic"" match with the actual transport, yet... I've got a build or two when the time arrives.",4.0
"This is one of the most impressive ships in the fleet.  The detail is excellent with varied coloring to add emphases.
Small molded details and openings on the underside hull make this look built not molded.
The addition of an X-wing Fighter is welcome.  Players tend to not have the number of X-wing and Tie fighters that we see in the movies.

This is a Huge Ship with new rules for initial placement, damage location and movement, this expansion come with a special maneuver template.
The transport is slow, hard to turn but capable of absorbing plenty of hits making it an interesting ship to play.
The ship has two set of damage cards, fore and aft.  Each set is ten cards following the standard damage card rules.
A three-part Evacuation of Hoth Campaign is our major chance to play this ship.  The rules state it cannot be fielded in 100-point squads of standard play.
Mission 8: Rendezvous requires three Rebel Transports to play and is not something I expect to see happen.
The rulebook would be improved by illustrating the special counters and placing them in a section.  Im still digging out what is what; most of the counters are part of the missions.
There is a good set of upgrade cards and new X-wing pilots in the box.

This is a good expansion but is best a late addition to your game because of the limited playability.",4.0
not to scale,4.0
Met expectations.,4.0
"As I am not a 100pt tournament player. I and my friends would like to see more variation in the ""missions"" available. The transport fits nicely into this category. It has no primary weapon system, so it is a support ship that needs to be  protected by other fighters. This model is well constructed, as are all FFG x-wing ships. The x-wing repaint is a welcome addition, along with the new unique pilots for it.",4.0
this is a great card game and this is a great expansion. The only down side is this is for only 2 of the seven factions and if you buy this as one of your first expansions you will find your self with a heavily weighted collection. I would recommend that you get one or two of the other data packs first or at the same time.,4.0
very cool expansion...  2 new heroes... some new monsters...  a new lieutenant (have to buy the miniature separately which I think is bogus)...  overall it's a cool add-on to one my favorite table top games.,4.0
"Wiz-War, 8th Edition
Designed by Tom Jolly and published by Fantasy Flight Games (reprinted in 2012 after 15 years out-of-print).

Overall: 8/10 (or 4 of 5 stars). Fun game play, high replayability, and quality components, let down by a bit of unnecessary over-complication.

First, some background. I last played Wiz-War while a high school student in the mid-80s. We played it quite a bit, and I remember it as a conceptually simple, but complex in play game that was hilarious in execution. Game material was quite basic -- a couple of cardboard map boards, some colored pawns and rocks as tokens, and a deck of simply printed cards. The fun of ""Take that, you dirty rat!"" gameplay outweighed all criticism of its production values. The challenge was in seeing if the new version of the game would live up to my memories -- a daunting challenge if there ever was one.

For those unfamiliar with Wiz-War, here's a brief outline of the concept. Each player controls a wizard, who has a section of maze containing two treasures. The goal of the original game was to steal two opponent's treasures and bring them back to your ""base"", or be the last wizard standing as you kill off the other wizards; the new game is won with two ""victory points"" scored either by killing an opposing wizard or getting a treasure back to your base. You have a hand of spells, up to seven, represented by cards, that are drawn randomly and placed into play on your turn to move, attack, and affect the terrain of the board. Spells also allow ""interrupts"" to defend against other attacks or neutralize spells in progress.

Opening the box of 8th Edition Wiz-War reveals some impressive production value. Gone are the simple screened 6""-square map boards and printed text cards. Instead, every item is full-color, made of high quality materials. There's a full color 20-page rulebook (much longer than I remember); four 10""-square color two-sided map boards; four plastic wizard figures with color bases, plus monster figures; a d4; 168 magic cards; four ""portal"" bases; and two sheets of think punch-out cardboard counters, which assemble into four hit-point wheels for the wizards plus a dazzling array of individual object markers, treasure markers, and other tokens. It's all very attractive, but a bit overwhelming in the quantity of different counters. (Well, OK, it's nothing near the complication of the number of counters in one of my other favorite games, MBT, but it certainly confused my wife, who'd never been exposed to the game before.)

The rulebook explains each of the components of the game in detail with useful graphics as well as sidebars to augment the basic text. The magic cards are no longer the simple text cards of yore; today they look like the complex cards of many other fantasy card games, with coded icons in each corner, a colorful illustration, and the description of the spell or item in question. Again, it's a bit complex -- I found myself repeatedly referring back to the rulebooks to decipher the icons, and I think it would have been simpler to pick up if the icons were replaced by text, though I do think with a few more game repetitions the icons will become second nature. The format will probably be second nature to modern card game fans (I am, admittedly, not much for card games).

Game play was quite similar to what I remember, though it took a bit of flipping back and forth in the rulebook to refresh my memory of play. There are some examples in sidebars, and I helped that I still remembered the basic flow of the game; an outright novice could probably have benefited from a multi-turn example of play added at the back.

The initial game started slowly as we felt out the sequence. There are three phases: a time phase that resolves spells with variable duration; a play phase in which the wizard can move up to three spaces, attack once, and play any number of other ""neutral"" spell cards; and a discard and draw phase for hand management. The game picked up speed as we became familiar with the spells and how they interacted (reading speed helps, particularly at the start of the game with multiple cards to read and an initial strategy to develop). A few things were different from the game I remember -- a limitation on cards in the hand plus spells in play; the fact that effects on the game board must be ""maintained"" rather than staying permanently (like the creation of stone blocks and walls in the maze); the use of ""items"" like magic stones that are carried around to provide other effects; and the ability to transform your wizard into another form such as a werewolf or gnome.

The provided counters are matched to various spell cards to represent effects on the game board (damaged walls, created walls, blocks, bushes), carried objects (stones swords, treasures, etc), and time durations of spells. Frankly, I found it a bit more complicated than it needed to be -- many of the objects could be more easily replicated by simply placing the spell card in front of you, and simpler tokens could suffice for most of the other placed items. The effect of the various counters is visually pleasing but it did slow the game to go hunting through a pile of counters for the ""right"" match to a particular spell.

The bit of counter confusion aside, after a few turns the game became the Wiz-War I'm familiar with: back-stabbing, spinning the board, dropping your opponent into pits, walling her up behind a created stone wall in the dead end of a labyrinth, grabbing a treasure and sprinting for home but then getting blasted, dropped, and fireballed before trying to teleport away to safety. The spells are all relatively simple but the combinations can be quite complex and fun ... provided your group likes a bit of an antagonistic game and can maintain their sense of humor and thick skin (a trait my wife, drafted to be my playtest dummy, lacks, so she found the game a bit frustrating).

After the first run through, we applied some of the ""optional"" rules from the back of the rulebook, which were actually base rules in the original Wiz-War, and the result was almost exactly the game I remember. Adding ""Uncluttered Mind"" (spells in play do not count against your hand) gives players more options each turn; ""deadly treasures"" (wizards die if both their treasures are placed on opposing wizards' bases) forces players to balance both offense and defense; ""permanent creations"" (created items do not have to be maintained) makes sure the battlefield stays fluid as walls and the like are created, and means that the ""hat"" counters to track who created an item are unnecessary; and ""treasure hunters"" (eliminates victory points for killing wizards) brings back the goal of ""get the treasures or be the last one standing"". The game picked up speed; our first game went about an hour with a lot of reading and rules review; the second was 45 minutes, and I can see games as short as half an hour with clever play, or much longer if the ""extended play"" rules are put into effect.

Overall, optional rules in play, this was the fun, exciting, highly variable beer-and-pretzels game I remember, with the added benefit of improved visuals, though the additional visual appeal does add some unnecessary complexity to the game. I'd definitely recommend this to a gaming group who wants a fast-paced competitive game that can be played quickly with high replay value. It isn't suited to groups who are seeking a cooperative play experience, who are easily offended by having their play thwarted, or who do not like games where players are eliminated in the course of play.",4.0
"Wiz-War is a classic game from the 80s that Fantasy Flight Games has revamped and released.  It's a essentially a magic combat game game involving tactics, card play and strategy.  Like the original game it's a 2-4 player game.  Game play is about an hour.

Setup: The board is made up of four individual segments.  You play with 2-4 of them depending on the number of players.  Each of them is double sided and can oriented in any way.  This allows for different game boards setups with each play.

Play: Movement is determined by dice rolls while cards determine various magical actions, items and modifiers.  The goal of the game is to get points in a capture the flag type scenario.  There is opportunity for movement tactics and magical combat along the way.

Overall Impression: I thought this game played best with 4 players.  The quality of the game is up to the typical fantasy flight standards.  Game play was pretty fast and overall I thought it was quite enjoyable.",4.0

"Wiz-War is fast-paced, chaotic, and ultimately a lot of fun.  Playing with four people is great, since it just adds to the chaos factor (something I quite enjoy).

The biggest criticism I have for this game (and really any game with this feature) is that once you are killed there's nothing left for you to do but watch the game finish out.  It's not as bad in Wiz-War because the games are reasonably short, even with 4 players, but I still think it's a crappy mechanic.",4.0
"Happy to have tried this game out, but I'm not super crazy about playing it all the time.",4.0
"I love Wiz-War but I don't think the 8th edition is as much fun as the editions I'm used to playing.

Many of the rules are easily ignored (like the dumb idea that you have to maintain spells in play as counting against your hand limit, which discourages playing the most interesting spells, or only playing with a few ""schools of magic"" which makes the same spells show up over and over and the gameplay super monotonous) but the game has been balanced, which oddly makes it much less enjoyable.  Part of the fun of earlier editions was not knowing whether you'd draw ""Permawarp"" or ""Large rock"" as your next card.  The 8th edition has nerfed the super powerful cards and dropped the mostly useless ones, which takes a lot of the random fun out of the game.  Also there are no monsters in 8th edition :-(.  (The rules imply that monsters can exist, so maybe they'll be an expansion pack...?).  The cards now also use an elaborate system of symbols and colors to indicate which kind of card they are, which new players find very confusing and sends them back to the poorly-organized rulebook over and over to look up what the symbols mean, it is not an improvement over the old boring cardstock that would have words like ""NEUTRAL"" or ""COUNTER-ATTACK"" printed directly on it.

The one unambiguous improvement that 8th ed. does have, other than the quality of the bits, is the rule that killing a wizard = 1 point, stealing a treasure = 1 point, and victory is reached at 2 points.  This tends to encourage combat in 3-4 player games which otherwise often become simply races.  But you could play with that rule in earlier editions too and don't need this edition to do it!",4.0

"The Slave 1 is one of the four Wave 2 expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game. Boba Fett (with a pilot skill of 8) is the star of this expansion set. He can change his bank maneuver (to bank left or right) which can be powerful and important in the game. We already have the starter set and a few others. This has a lot of upgrade cards. You can arm your star fighter with missiles, laser or ion cannons and bombs. The Slave 1 is a powerful, large, versatile, imperial ship that has an auxiliary firing arc. Not only does it have the focus and target lock on the action bar, but it also has an evade action. With the agility value of 2 and evade together gives the Firespray a good chance of less damage done in the game.

You can arm your star fighter with missiles, laser or ion cannons and bombs. After playing a few games, we think it would be better to have a few more X Wings and not just the original core starter set in order to play a really good game, just our preference. While there are new rules, there is also a new mission.",4.0

"Wiz-War: 2-4 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 45 to 60 Minutes

Wiz-War is a competitive board game, and a chaotic one at that. You take on the role of a wizard who's trying to defeat all of the other wizards on the board. The goal is to be the first wizard to two points or the last wizard standing, whichever comes first. When a wizard is taken out, he's eliminated from the game.

Every wizard (red, blue, green, or yellow) has their own player board. These player boards have different layouts to keep things interesting. Players are assigned a random wizard color to encourage players to not get attached to a particular board layout. On top of that, player boards are two sided...one side being the classic version (from years ago) and one side being the newer version. It's important that players do not mix and match versions...be sure to decide on which version you'd like to use before you play. The difference lies mainly in the layout of the walls and the starting locations of your treasure tokens...so it's not that big of a deal.

Players then combine all of the colored boards of the wizards who are playing to form the dungeon. Rotate the boards randomly to keep the layouts different from game to game. The board also has portals that players can step through to travel quickly to other parts of the dungeon. The manual explains how to set up the portals and combine the boards, so it's not as complicated as it sounds.

The game features multiple schools of magic, each with their own deck. Players choose up to four schools of magic to form the main deck that everyone will draw from throughout the game. Alternate rules allow players to choose particular / unique schools of magic that only they draw from. In this case, one wizard might choose Mutation and Alchemy, whereas another might choose to specialize in Elemental and Conjuring.

Players take turns moving, attacking, and drawing new cards. Their goal is to steal treasure tokens from their opponents and bring them back to their home square to score points. Players receive one point for each treasure successfully stolen, though an opponent can steal that same treasure right back, robbing them of the victory point. A player who kills another is awarded a permanent victory point. Players are given a hitpoints counter to keep track of how close to death they are. Whoever gets two victory points or is the last wizard standing wins.

The real meat and potatoes of the game are the cards you play. Some cards are attack cards, some cards are counter cards which act like interrupts, some cards are item cards which you permanently carry for a bonus, and some cards are neutral spells that alter gameplay in some fashion. There are also energy cards that can boost your movement speed (how many spaces you can go) and improve the duration or power of a spell. Energy cards can turn a simple fireball card into a powerhouse that can knock off half of your health in one hit.

It can be overwhelming at first to get used to how all of the cards play out. We often spent a minute reading cards aloud along with the interrupt to see the net effect, taking into account line of sight and energy cards that can be played to boost power to certain spells. Once players get used to how to cards work together, gameplay is quick and smooth. Until then, expect to spend a minute or two scratching your head trying to figure out how an odd card is meant to be applied. I had / have the same issue with Magic the Gathering...lots of cards and lots of special rules to take into account. Luckily, Wiz-War is light compared to Magic the Gathering in terms of card variety and complexity.

My eleven year old, Vinnie, had some difficulty with understanding the cards' effects. Perhaps as we play more games he may get used to them. He was also frustrated when his wizard was eliminated...this game can lead to a bit of bad sportsmanship if you're the sore loser type. I can tell he wasn't happy when he was eliminated...to be fair, he had no qualms about punching me with a metal gloved item and a fire cloak for seven damage. Regardless, he enjoyed the overall experience. He said that his favorite part was figuring out how best to move your wizard and attack based on the kinds of attacks you had available. The strategy aspect of combat really had him engaged.

Anthony, the sixteen year old, won the game by the skin of his teeth. It was a close battle between the two of us until he drew a lifestone item card that replenished one health per turn. No matter how many firewalls I threw up and electric bolts I hit him with, I could never kill him...I came very close but he won through attrition with his constant life replenishment. He said that he enjoyed the combat element and all the different cards you could play to kill the other wizards.

Personally, I think the game is OK...I like it and I dislike it. I like it because the game has a Magic the Gathering vibe to it and is light to boot. There's enough variety in the cards to make things interesting. With that said, the cards you draw are random...if you end up getting a lot of crappy neutral spell cards with no attacks or interrupts, players can wail on you without you having much in the way of defending yourself. Personally, I drew a lot of interrupts so I was able to block attacks left and right but I didn't see a lot of attack cards, forcing me to make a run for treasures for my points. The random luck of the draw can ruin even the best wizard's day. By the same token, some players may enjoy the random chaos that comes from such a mechanic. This game would be best for players who aren't all that competitive and just enjoy a semi-casual dungeon battle. Young children may be confused and overwhelmed by the cards themselves and highly competitive players may get postal when random luck takes a dump all over their best laid plans.

If you're someone who isn't turned off by games that require a lot of card reading (like Magic the Gathering, Dominion, Innovation, etc) and you don't mind chaos and random luck sometimes taking the driver's seat, then by all means, pick this up.",4.0
"The StarViper is one of four new Wave 6 expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game. As with the other expansions in this wave, one of the more interesting things about this wave is that it introduced a third faction: Scum and Villainy.  I have to admit that including these ships in your squad seems a little expensive for what you get (thus the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars), but I still think there are some good reasons to add at least one StarViper to your Scum fleet.

To begin with it has 3 attack, 3 agility, 4 hull, and 1 shields.  One off the coolest new things about this wave/ship is that it introduces the new Sengors Loop maneuver (which is like doing a K-turn with a soft left or right instead of a straight template).  And, all of the ships can take a torpedo upgrade, and the unique pilots can also take an elite pilot talent upgrade. Pilots include:

(1) Prince Xizor, a level 7 unique pilot that costs 31 points whose special ability reads, When defending, a friendly ship at Range 1 may suffer 1 uncanceled [HIT] or [CRIT] result instead of you.

(2) Guri, a level 5 unique pilot that costs 30 points whose special ability reads, At the start of the Combat phase, if you are at Range 1 of an enemy ship, you may assign 1 focus token to your ship.

(3) Black Sun Vigo, a level 3 non-nique pilot that costs 27 points.

(4) Black Sun Enfforcer, a level 1 non-unique pilot that costs 25 points.

It also includes nine upgrade cards (Ive included details on some of my favorites below). The list of upgrades includes body guard, calculation (an elite pilot talent that lets you change a focus to a CRIT), accuracy corrector (which lets you cancel all attack dice results and then add 2 hits to the results), ion torpedoes, inertial dampeners (which can be discarded to do a white 0 maneuver, after which you have to take a stress token), hull upgrade, Virago (a 1 point StarViper only title upgrade that lets you add a sensor upgrade and the new illicite upgrade to one of your unique pilots upgrade bar), and autothrusters X2 (a 1 point modification that reads, When defending, if you are beyond Range 2 or outside the attackers firing arc, you may change 1 of your blank results to a [EVADE] result. You can equip this card only if you have the [BOOST] action icon.

As with all expansions, this one includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game (though a copy of the base set is still needed to play).

Overall, I think this wave in general and this ship in particular (especially some of the upgrades) adds some great twists to an already fun game.",4.0
"I'd rate it 5 star, but I like the Millennium Falcon better.",4.0
"Great game, nice figs",4.0
"A little wobbly on its base, but in play, it is valuable and includes some great cards.",4.0
"Here's the key points you need to know about this expansion

Pro... The cards, oh Force above, the cards! Autothrusters, x2, yes please! Accuracy Corrector? Don't mind if I do! This would be only a 3 star product if not for those.

Con...The pilots/cost. It is a bit of a challenge to field effectively. This was to be the ATF of SnV but, like the E and Defender, it comes out a bit squadron cost pricey. Guri seems to see the most use, any pilot who had an ability that grants effectively an action is usually worth it, and she pairs well as a Mindlinked elite. Keep an eye out in the future though, this ship being a bit too expensive for what it does might get fixed. I expect FFG will do something akin to the cannon/primary weapon TIE Defender title when SNV eventually gets a veterans or aces box set.

Pro... The models design/look, even with it's simple color scheme, it appears exactly as unique and cool as the ad picture. I've also seen very few factory paint errors around the cockpit (easily the most noticeable flaw in several other ffg Xwing minis). In short, yeah it looks good! I've always wondered if it was inspired by Babylon 5 fighters (or the other way around) but whatever the case, it's up there with a Defender or the YT2400 for looking cool on the table.

Con... F.r.a.g.i.l.e. Much like the Y and B Wing or TIE Defender, double check it's construction and connection points ASAP, make sure if it's defective you can still return for one that isn't broken. When you store it, be extra careful. It's beautiful and unique looks come at the price of not being as sturdy as a simpler models like say a Scyk or Headhunter.

Amazon Pro: Often 4-5 bucks cheaper than in stores. Especially if you're just buying for the Autothrusters, and if you fly As, t70s, or Interceptors you probably are, this is likely your cheapest bet new. The other reason I give it four not three stars on here.",4.0
"Fun little ship! Any Scum player should have one, as it comes with staple upgrades. A little expensive to include on a tournament caliber team, but for casual players, it makes for a fun squad to build around its combo potential.",4.0
Awesome model and interesting with the mirrored firing arc though the ship can still be a bit difficult to play. Good weapon platform but can be a tad vulnerable  considering the 360 arc to many other large ships.,4.0

"I'm not going to repeat the same thing as the other reviews but it is a great addition to your arsenal.

I do want to warn you to be careful with the back (engine-side) of the wings though. There is a wing attachment on top that is extremely fragile. One of mine was broken off when I received it but it is an extremely simple super glue fix.",4.0

"Others have covered how excellent the narrative dice system is in this game, so I will focus on the physical dice themselves.  A good selection of dice come in a pack, color coded by type.  On most of them, the symbols are very clear, but on a few the dice were not completely inked.  The colors don't pop as much as they do in pictures, and some of the dice have small divots where the plastic was poured into the mold.

They havn't chipped or cracked, so I remain hopeful that these are just minor quibbles, but I am a little wary of how long they will last with heavy use.",4.0

"It was definitely a solid Expansion.  My only complaint (and this is something I know some people probably like) is that they segmented parts off to very specific situations.  Maybe I want to go to Antarctica even when the cards don't say I should need to.

"Again a awesome quality game by fantasy flight. Fantasy flight has really won me over and is my favorite game company. When they announced that they would be producing the game it was immediately added to my wish list. This game has awesome components and is very fun yet tricky to master.

I know they have said that it keeps cost down but many other company's have awesome inserts and don't cost that much. I would gladly pay 5-7 more dollars for some kind of insert. It's just molded plastic! C'mon fantasy flight!!",4.0
Decently made and very clear to read which for most people is a must. I'm glad we purchased these dice for the group as it is much easier to decipher the out come of a roll by looking at it rather than discern the out come using regular dice with the rather unusual chart that has you rolling high on one dice low on another and a mid point on another. Essentially these are a time saver which is great for my group as we usually only get about 4 hours to play due to scheduling.,4.0

We're going to take a break and play with only the aspects that can be integrated in the main game rather than using the new board for awhile, I'd say this is better if you're already more advanced. Love the new characters & other cards though. Lots of great abilities!",4.0
"The game is fantastic and this expansion is great. My only major issue is that much of what is added, like the Antarctica board, feel a little too superfluous. It feels more like a small expansion where the content comes from the extra cards, rather than in Arkham Horror, where the big box expansions add content that changes the game play dramatically.

Still is a very fun game and a great expansion.",4.0

The only downside is you might have to buy two packs depending on the stats and such.  You definitely will if your a GM.  So i took off a star for that.  I wish they were sold in double the size.  It took me until I actually played to realize I needed a second set.",4.0

"XCOM is certainly innovative, and it's certainly fun. It's entirely possible to do everything right and still lose because the dice just refuse to go your way. While this might seem unfun or unfair, long time XCOM players (the PC video game series and recent remake for PC and consoles) know this feeling well. That utterly unfair act, however, is where XCOM really shines, and the board game captures this very well. XCOM asks you ""Why should you stand a chance against a superior alien invasion?""

The short answer is that you don't really have a fair shot at victory, and you really shouldn't. The aliens are more powerful in just about every way. This is XCOM's conceit, and it'll have you pulling your hair out. In a fun way.

The game is for 1-4 players. Each player is assigned a role, or multiple roles when you have less than 4 people at the board. The required app (either iOS, Android, or web-browser based) will adjust time length accordingly for the number of participants. In solo mode, I felt rushed but never like I didn't have the time I need. Except once... but more on that in a second. The roles feel well balanced, but certain roles will definitely appeal to different play styles.

First, the Commander. Despite his authoritative name, he never really gets to feel like he's in charge. This feels like a missed opportunity somewhat. The Commander is responsible for dispatching interceptors (fighter craft) to attack UFOs over the map. He controls a few of XCOM's perks, and most importantly controls the budget. Near the beginning of every timed round, he is told how many credits XCOM has available and is responsible for pulling them out. This is the only time the app clearly needs to give just a few more seconds to the player. I kept my credit pool stacked neatly in stacks of 5 (it comes with 29... don't go crazy trying to find your missing one), and I still nearly ran out of time when it told me I had 13 credits in the budget. The Commander can also dip into XCOM's limited cash reserves, and has a special ""asset"" card given by what continent XCOM HQ is placed in, a location which is assigned by the application. Every unit the team places on the board, whether Soldier, Scientist, Satellite, or Interceptor, costs XCOM 1 credit. Ostensibly, the players communicate with the Commander about how much they really need from the budget. Go over budget, and you accelerate your march to losing the game. Ultimately, though, the Commander has no real say over how many units other people place on the board. He can tell the Chief Scientist that we can only afford two scientists this round, be completely ignored, and have the game lost. Teamwork is important, but it feels like ""Commander"" should mean something.

The Central Officer is responsible for controlling the application and using satellites to defend against UFOs in orbit, and also control (slightly) the flow of the invasion using his satellites as well. It's him that tells the Commander how much money they have, tells the Squad Leader to pick a mission, and tells the Scientist it's time to assign research. This, to me, is one of the more engaging roles to play, but at the same time you often feel powerless. You help out in a jam, but the team relies on your ability to communicate quickly and clearly more than anything else.

The Chief Scientist has an odd role. His position is the least stressful - when rolling the dice during the non-timed ""resolution"" phase, exhausting his scientists doesn't feel as disastrous as losing a Soldier would to the Squad Leader, or an Interceptor to the Commander. They're essentially playing a card game by themselves (with technologies they can research to enhance other players along the way). They fill their hand up to six cards at the beginning of the timed phase, and from there they start assigning research when told to. The nuanced part of this job is watching the board to see who might really need the most help. Everybody needs more, but the Chief Scientist is really the only one with the ability to influence the dice. Many of his technologies offer rerolls, automatic successes, money, and more to the other players. Towards the end of the game, the importance of this role starts to diminish as players have what they (hopefully) need to beat the game, and he'll find his research becoming a low priority as focus is shifted elsewhere. It feels right given the theme, but the scientist becomes a more passive role late in the game with less to offer.

Finally, the Squad Leader. This player is responsible for base defense (hence preventing one way of losing the game, the other being two countries falling into panic) and for conducting missions. Along with the final mission, which is the team's only way to win. He plays a game of quickly matching symbols associated with different classes of Soldier to symbols marked on mission cards and enemy cards. The symbols on the card dictate how many Soldiers can try to accomplish the task or fight the enemy, and what kind are capable of it. Good matches generate extra dice, and the Commander can help by taking out an extra Soldier for training the Officer Training School, giving that Soldier an extra die against all tasks. If things go wrong for the Squad Leader, losing the game won't be far behind.

Taken together, all of these roles make for a pretty engaging game. I'm withholding one star because the aggregate effect of some of the minor issues I outlined above can start to wear on your nerves. The Commander needs just two or three more seconds to do his job. The Chief Scientist is boring at the end of the game. The Commander isn't REALLY in charge (in fact, the Central Officer has more ability to move pieces off the board and cancel orders).

Even with these minor issues, it's incredible fun, and with a play of about 40 to 50 minutes, you can get several games completed in a night. The app works well. There was an early issue with people losing their game if a call came through on their phone that some reviewers mentioned, but when I had to unexpectedly close the app and leave the house, it asked me if I wanted to resume when I started it back up. It started me at the beginning of the resolutions phase, but it was easy to pick up from there. A good design choice. I worry a little about the future of a game that depends on an application to play. If I take good care of it, I'll still be able to play Agricola 30 years from now. The app has added boundless possibilities to this game, but if support is ever dropped then this board game will become an oversize paperweight.

I highly recommend this game for any number of players. Four players is absolutely the best, but it remains fun even down to one player. In fact, at one player there's no one to blame for bad decision but yourself. Set up and tear down is fairly easy, and other than getting one or two baggies for the cardboard chits, everything else in the box came pre-bagged and separated. Everything feels high quality, which is typical of Fantasy Flight Games.

Board game enthusiasts really should add this one to their collection, and I'd even say that many players unfamiliar with modern board gaming have a good entry point here. The application will teach you how to play the game. In fact, it's the only way, the rulebook only shows board layout. I lost a good four or five hours of my day when I opened this one up, and I recommend you do the same.",4.0
"I want to love these Edge of the Empire dice, and I do, mostly.

PROS + *****

--Players and GMs will find the symbols easy to understand and fun to interpret. Each roll gives players not only a check for success or failure, but also a narrative consequence for having taken the action requiring the check. These advantages, threats, triumph, and despair don't affect the outcome of the check in terms of success or failure, but they  occur along with the results of the check.  For example, you succeed in blasting the door control, sealing it shut, but you also rolled a despair--and consequently you destroyed the control to extend the bridge over the chasm.

--Not only do the dice propel the game narrative, they also reveal why you succeeded. Was it your innate talent (ability dice)? Was it your training (proficiency dice)? Or was it an external circumstance (boost dice)? The dice also reveal the reason for your failure.  Was it the innate difficulty of the task or superior talent of your opposition (difficulty dice)? Was it the unsurpassable training of your adversary (Challenge dice)? Or did external factors such as environment hinder your progress (setback dice)?

--The Force Dice  also offer players a way to upgrade their dice pools, and give a shot at rolling triumph. Triumph counts as a success and as a separate associated narrative benefit for the player. Beware, however, for each light side destiny point used, that destiny point gets flipped to the dark side, accessible to the GM to upgrade the difficulty of player checks or upgrade the checks of player opponents. Stormies could be rollin' multiple Proficiency dice against you, pitiful smuggler.

--The dice are well constructed heavy, tumbled plastic with easy to read symbols that evoke that Star Wars Feeling (explosions for success, down arrows for failure, wings reminiscent of Rebel Phoenix wings for advantage, TIE fighter windows for threat, Jedi Lightsaber and flare for triumph and a downward arrow with sphere for despair. And light circles for the Light Side of the Force and Black circles for the Dark side of the Force.

CONS -0 *

Not enough Challenge dice (only 1)
Not enough Force dice (only 1)

Show-stopper CON -1*

NO percentile dice come with this set. Percentile dice ARE REQUIRED to play Edge of the Empire. Edge of the Empire uses percentile dice for numerous purposes, including rolling character obligation, character motivation, checking obligation, and checking the effect of critical hits. A Fantasy Flight Games rep stated on the Order 66 Podcast that their decision to exclude percentile dice was based on  a desire to keep the cost lower, and, the opinion, that many RPGers already have percentile dice. I think FFG should have raised the cost of the dice set by a few dollars and included percentile dice. Not EVERY household has extra percentile dice. Not every RPGer has legacy percentile dice available, and newcomers will ask, ""huh, what's a percentile die?"" It's a letdown to not be able to play right out of the box. I'd gladly play a few more dollars to avoid another hunt for more dice.",4.0

"I like this game, but (and there's always a but) I wished there was cards to draw instead of an app. It's an okay app, but there's the deal of either having a laptop or tablet (of which neither I own) or tying up your smartphone.

The components seem to be great quality, board is heavy weight standard cardboard with vibrant colors, the cards and pieces are really great too. all in all It's a great game!",4.0
They are great dice and I enjoy the mechanic for the game. The one problem is that pretty much without the special dice you can't play the game. Maybe if the dice set came with stickers to put on regular dice to supplement so that a whole other set does not need to be purchased when you need just one more of a color.,4.0
"The dice are great, but there are so few in contrast to the price (compared to how many you'd get for a normal set) that if you're playing with any decent sized group you need 2-3 of these to really be well off and even then people are going to have to share them quite often. On the plus side each set came with 4 light/dark side destiny points which I wasn't expecting.",4.0
The dice are good quality - not cheap lightweight plastic or anything.  The only thing I noticed was that while one can easily play with one set they kept the quantity just at that point where you're thinking it might be nice to have two.,4.0
"Initially I was disappointed.  These dice feel lighter (cheaper?) than normal Chessex polyhedral gaming dice, and the destiny tokens are a heavy stock paper (not plastic).  After thinking about it - a 7 piece set of Chessex typically runs between $5 and $15.  This set has 14 dice.  I have to imagine if the dice were heavier and if the tokens were also plastic the set would run about $25, which would really invite complaints.

So I've decided on 4 stars.  The system is innovative and these dice make it run.  You need two sets to really play EotE, however.",4.0
"XCOM: The Board Game is a tabletop adaptation of  recent Firaxis XCOM reboot game. The board game was published by Fantasy Flight Games and supports 1-4 players. The previously mentioned game app is mandatory to play the game and is available for both iOS and Android or for your desktop computer. And if you still don't have those options, you can run the browser-based app.

In the game you need to manage four different roles that are part of the XCOM game. The Commander is responsible for tracking the level of panic in the different continents that support XCOM along with assigning interceptors around the world to fight off alien UFOs. The Central Officer relays updates from the companion app and is also responsible for deploying satellites as part of the orbital defense initiative. The Chief Scientist assigns research-related tasks and allocates scientists to your projects. And the Squad Leader deploys soldiers to missions and handles base defense. Regardless of the number of players involved, someone will need to handle each of the different roles. Thus a 1-player game has the player dealing with all four roles at once.

Most actions in the game are resolved with a varying number of XCOM dice and the Alien Die. XCOM dice are six-sided dice with only two faces that represent successes. The Alien Die is an 8-sided die that interacts with the level of threat for that particular roll. You typically select a number of dice based on the resources involved in the roll (e.g. number of interceptors, number of satellites, number of soldiers). The Alien Die is also rolled and compared to the current threat level. You keep rolling until you attain the needed number of successes or the Alien Die is equal to or less than the current threat level. You are allowed to re-roll your dice as many times as you want per task, but every re-roll causes the threat level of go up by one to a maximum of five.

The dice aspect sounds simple enough since you'll be rolling an average of 2-3 dice for more aggressive roles together with the Alien Die. But That's still a 33% chance of success per die with increasingly difficult odds related to the Alien Die. At times the low success rate gets pretty frustrating, but in hindsight it nicely reflects the level of difficulty often experienced in the game.

The board game is an amazing translation of the original computer game. The added nuance of dividing the resource management challenge across the different roles was a great idea and it forces players to communicate more openly all with the added pressure of the companion app counting down per action step. And it's hard to think about the team budget as the Commander when you see everyone allocating resources as they see fit since pretty much every piece on the board costs money. A scientist can quickly drain your funds early in the round just be maxing out all research projects, thus leaving you with insufficient funds for troops to send on the mission or satellites to place in orbit.

And the app also plays more subtle roles in terms of randomizing the initial mix of aliens or determining your budget per round. Success in a mission and a lack of UFOs around the planet really help you while failing to deal with such threats can delay your progress significantly. And should you leave any UFOs in orbit, communications can then get disrupted and the app will start randomizing how it relays information to the Central Officer. Thus you may be forced to allocate interceptors before you know where all of the UFOs will land around the planet. All these little quirks just add to the dynamism of the game.

It's a pretty hard game to master even on the easy level, but you can argue that the same can be said about games like Pandemic and Forbidden Desert. But the game in itself is pretty fun and the challenge is one you really want to defeat. And once you're comfortable with the easy level of difficulty, things just get worse at higher difficulties - and that's just how the game works.

XCOM: The Board Game is tough, but fun and a great game for fans of the original XCOM computer game. I strongly recommend you play with a larger number of players since juggling more than one role can get pretty dizzying at times.",4.0
It's a fun game that keeps the feel of the computer games. The only thing I don't like is you have to download an app on your phone to play. The up side is the app walks through a tutorial and allows each game to be random.,4.0
"The first thing you notice when you open the box is that there is no rulebook to speak of.  Instead, we get a leaflet showing a recommended (partial) set-up and then we're told to download that (free) companion app.  In the app, there is an option for a walk-through which is how you will be learning how to play the game.  Honestly, I really like this way of doing things.  Considering I am, many times, stuck with being the one who reads the rule book and teaches the game, it was pretty cool to have the app walk me (and everyone else at the table) through an entire game.  The app also (now) has a built in compendium and faq section in case any questions should arise.

So why the app?  Well, it serves 2 functions.  First, it's a randomizer for game events.  Second, it's a timer.  And the app creates a super high level of tension throughout each game.  At its core, X Com is a fairly straight forward puzzle game.  Its fairly easy to figure out the best things to do every turn if you just take a moment to look at the current state of the board and the state of your resources.  But now we throw in a timer to give you a less time than you might be comfortable with to solve the puzzle.  Oh, and to mix things up even more, we're going to give each player a different piece of the puzzle.  Now, to really spice things up, we're going to tell you each turn when each player can take his/her turn...but we're going to randomize that a little while sprinkling in a healthy dose of alien activity.  And just to keep you on your toes, we may just add a few more aliens to the board after you've taken your turn, but before the resolution phase where you have to battle to save the world from the e.t. invasion.  So suddenly what you thought was a walk in the park mission turns into a real cluster...bomb.  But that's not all.  After you're done assigning soldiers, dispatching your fleet and telling your scientists what to do, you've now got a push your luck dice rolling element to try to complete all those tasks.

If you really meaty, mentally draining behemoths, then this game probably isn't for you.  This is the mental equivalent of a dexterity game.  Its not all that thought provoking, but by the end of the game, you can't help but let out a deep sigh of relief (in a good way) just to have the game end.  A good analogy might be the classic timer game Concentration where you are rushed by a constantly ticking timer to put all the different shaped pegs into the proper slots.  Now imagine playing that, but now you've got 30 times more pegs and you get 30-45 minutes to minutes.  That's what X Com feels like.

But the important question is: ""Will this game stand up to the test of time?""  I'm...not really sure either way.  The issue is that the problem you are trying to solve, save the world from an alien invasion, is a constant.  The tools you have are constant.  The only things you don't know are the order in which you set-up your tasks and exactly how difficult each task will be in any given round.  ...in the end, I guess it really comes down to how much randomness you can tolerate and your own personal threshhold of how much randomness can be included in a board game and still be able to call it a board game.  If you don't care about not knowing everything when you are required to make your move, and you don't mind push your luck dice rolling, then this game is great.  If you're idea of a fun game night consists of Caverna and/or Powergrid, then this game will probably be too light and end up floating down that stream that leads to obscurity.",4.0
This is a great expansion pack for Arkham Horror... if you already have expansion packs.  This pack adds cards to the packs you already have.  It does not stand alone with Arkham Horror.,4.0
"This one expands the previous expansions of Arkham. If you haven't already purchased a number of the expansions (at least 4) it's probably not worth the money, but if you have almost all the other expansions and are looking for a way for them to all integrate together better...this is a great way to do it.",4.0
"Overall this is a great addition to Arkham Horror and every other expansion set they've ever made.  It's basically just more cards for everything.  I understand that with the big board expansions (Innsmouth, Dunwich & Kingsport) Miskatonic actually increases the odds of drawing an open gate at these boards.  That's good news as the biggest problem with those boards is that you could have potentially finished a whole game without ever visiting those boards.  Um, this comment is for all you veterans.

If you're completely new to Arkham Horror, I DON'T recommend you buying this product.  Why?  Again, pretty much what this box does is expand on all the previous expansions.  So if you don't have any of the old expansions or only half of them, this box is a heavy drop in the wallet for you.  Buy this expansion last out of all of them and you'll feel your money's better earned.  Or after you've purchased all three of aforementioned board expansion sets.

The box also includes some quick reference cards that tell you your limits based on # of players like monster limit on board, outskirt limit, # of open gates until the AO awakens.  These cards are surprisingly useful.  When I first looked at these I thought they'd be useless as you just remember this stuff anyways but with the cards it's a great quick reference for everyone at the table to glance at.  So we use them all the time.

The last thing the box introduces are institutions.  These are similar to Guardians except they're man-made and man-run organizations like the Miskatonic Univeristy, the Crime Organization and the FBI Bureau.  Since we've played a few games with all of them, my players (and most everyone on the net) think these cards weren't thoroughly play-tested.  All of them could have been tweaked just a bit.  And this may be the most disappointing thing as I read the previews on these organizations I was pretty excited about seeing a semi-new mechanic being introduced but now, it's a shame that they just weren't play-tested enough.

Actually, my biggest disappointment was that they really didn't fix the Lurker herald.  Sigh.  They just added more reckoning cards and some of them are pretty deadly.  But what they really needed to do was to fix and reprint the Lurker Herald card.  Oh well, maybe next time.

Overall a great buy if you're a vet and have every expansion set but if you're a newbie, hold off on this one.",4.0

"The game is a ton of fun, but brutal as can be.  One mistake from any player and you spend the rest of the game attempting to recover.  The game is a fantastic break from traditional board games and does a great job of capturing the feel of the XCOM franchise.  The game is good and worth a play; especially by fans of the video games.",4.0
"This is a great interactive, engaging strategy game. It came with all of the pieces and we had no trouble getting the corresponding phone application to play. It takes a while to get the hang of it, so more comprehensive directions would be nice, but it ended up being hours of fun! My brother and his friends played as well, and it was nice to see them having so much fun with something that didn't require a television and console. The reason I gave this four stars is because I intended to give it to my brother as a birthday gift, and the box arrived pretty badly damaged. The package itself looked fine, but when we opened it up one of the sides of the board game box was almost entirely separated. It was a little disappointing to give as a present, but none of the contents were damaged and we fixed the box with some tape.",4.0

"This is a wonderful game, I want to give it 5 stars, but it is not exactly accessible to a wide audience like its video game counterpart is.

"This game which uses the popular video game license is part of the recent crop of board games that uses an integrated mobile app.  I have seen both good and bad examples of this.  I adore Alchemists and think it works wonderfully with its app but think Golem Arcana is a video game with superfluous physical components.

Fans of the video game may be expecting turn/grid-based combat but this game focuses more on the management aspects of the game.  Each player takes on one of the 4 roles in the game and each role is associated with a set of actions that player has to do from managing the budget to assigning troops to accomplish missions.  This is a timed cooperative game much like Space Alert and one of the roles is responsible for reading the information from the app to the other players which dictates how the game is played during the timed phase.  The different actions during the timed phase happen in a different order each time and aspects of those actions change each round as well, such as how much money the Commander role gets in the budget.

I love how the app works with the game.  It mixes things up each round and keeps the tension level high and players on their toes so they can never really plan too much ahead of time.  This also does a lot to eliminate the ""alpha gamer"" problem some players experience in cooperative games.  With just a short amount of time to take each of your actions in the timed phase players can only really worry about what their role is responsible for.

This game is tough, we actually lost the tutorial mission, and spectacularly at that.  By definition isn't a tutorial mission supposed to be a free win?  The game seems to be all about making the right sacrifices.  We tried to do too much the first game and ended up spending too much money and going broke pretty fast.  Meanwhile UFOs were blowing up our planes and we were left with no defense and no money to buy more.

Finally, the tutorial itself is a great way to learn the game as long as you enter it with the right mindset.  It introduces concepts while playing and only a little bit at a time so we had players, especially experienced gamers, wondering what everything did right away but the tutorial wasn't telling us that yet.  If you don't look at it as specifically a learning game where you don't get all the information up front then it can be frustrating.  But if you do it was a smooth process that got me completely up to speed while actually doing it and I think I would have no problem teaching this game to others now.

The components are also very good and there seems to be an okay amount of variety in the different missions, tech cards, etc.  All in all a very solid game and one that uses the integrated app ""gimmick"" very well.",4.0

"Game Master's Kit might be a stretch.

The produce consists of a game master four board screen and a thirty page, starter adventure.

"The board is high quality and is very simple to use. It also comes with a free campaign, which is always nice.

My only critique would be the lack of text about being a good GM in this particular system. The main book has a lot of information, and a few general pointers that apply no matter the system. I was hoping this kit might have some tips and information on running this particular system more effectively for those not as familiar with it, but who have experience GM'ing.",4.0
"I'm a big fan of X-wing and the new pilots and alternate painted ships included in this Package are great, but unfortunately I'm a little disappointed in what's NOT included in this package. The first issue is that I feel like there are not enough ship tokens if you wanted to use some of the Y-wings and Z-95s that you already had for the Rebels, or if you already had more than 1 Firespray or HWK.  The package only includes:

2 Firespray tokens: Unique PS 8/Unique PS 6 and Unique PS 7/Generic PS5
2 HWK-290 tokens: U7/U3 and U5/G1
3 Z-95 tokens: U7/G3, U5/G1, and G3/G1
3 Y-Wing tokens: U7/G4, U5/G2, and G4/G2

You can't run more than two of the Firesprays or HWKs and even if you run two your combinations are limited. You also can't run more than three of the Zs or Ys and if you run more than two your combinations are again, limited. This may or may not be an issue for people but I feel like they could have added just a little more cardboard to such an expensive expansion. Yes, you are getting three new ship models but for most of us they are ships we already had several of.  The important thing in this expansion was the new cardboard to convert what you already had and I feel like they just could have added a little more for the price. Ideally they could have even added some extra rebel tokens and cards (for the Zs and Ys) to bolster those fleets as well since we were getting the extra ships.

Another component that is missing is Bombs.  The Bomb Load-out upgrade for The Y-Wing is one of the things I was most anticipating with this expansion.  You get two copies of the card which is nice (3 would have been nicer) but you don't get any bomb cards or tokens at all, so I hope you already had some from a TIE Bomber or Slave I expansion.  It would have been super cool if there were a new bomb type to go along with the Bomb Load-out and the new Andrasta title for the Firespray, but at the very least they should have included some of the existing bombs, especially the proximity mine that is too large to include in a standard small ship expansion's packaging.

The other HUGE disappointment is that there are no missions included with this expansion.  I've grown accustomed to all of the large box expansions including at least one new mission in the instructions and I was excited to see what cool new mission they might have for this new faction, but instead all you get is one single sheet with assembly instructions and the maneuver charts. That's it.  To be fair I have yet to actually play any of the missions included with the game, but I like reading over them and the brief narratives they add to the game. Several missions detailing the  exploits of Black Sun or the Hutt Cartels wold have been cool.

Overall, I like all the new Pilots and the Upgrades, and the new faction adds some more excitement to the game. The new paint jobs on the models are cool.  I just feel like the largest expansion yet (besides the epic ships) which is introducing a whole new faction should of had more content with some missions and more components to let the people who have already invested a ton into this game take full advantage of it.",4.0
"Most Wanted is one of the four Wave 6 expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game. With this expansion pack for Scum and Villainy, you get 2 z95 Headhunters and a Y-wing, all in a darker color scheme. The maneuver dials and base stats for each the ships are the same as in the prior released models. The z95s have 4 pilot cards with 2 duplicates. Missile upgrade, illicit, and elite upgrades are available. The Y-WING has 4 pilot cards with 2 duplicates as well. 2 title cards for the y-wing, 8 droid cards, hot shot blaster card, 2 bomb loadout cards, 2 autoblaster turret cards, Greedo, outlaw tech and a k4 security droid. Also included are 4 ship cards and a movement dial to run a HWK-290 for the Scum and Villainy.

And if that's not enough, 4 new pilot cards with special rules for Boba Fetts Slave 1, movement dial and a title card Andrasta, which allows you to carry 2 additional bombs. This pilot special rule is crazy. Emon Azzameen bounty hunter pilot for the Slave 1 can release bombs using the movement turn 3 or straight 3 template, instead of using the straight 1 movement template.

The only con is that we wish there were a couple more devious measures for vehicle upgrades though. That is the only reason it is not getting a 5 star rating.",4.0
A much needed third faction for an already incredible game. Repaints of old ships plus tons of faction specific cards. This will really get you started.,4.0

"While it's heavily reliant on models that are not included (the HWK-290 and Slave-1 expansion packs), this is still an essential expansion for anyone wanting to begin using the third faction. At $40, it provides good value against individual Z95 and Y-Wing expansion packs, and provides some terrific upgrades for both of those ships. While the other S&V expansions provide the aces for your fleet, this set provides the cannon fodder.

Plus, it provides cards and tokens to enable a true monster of a Boba Fett. The Firespray becomes a true menace with this expansion. Well recommended.",4.0
"Just getting into the game, but they paint jobs on the models are some of the best I've seen on pre-painted miniatures.",4.0
"The X-Wing expansion is a nice addition to a fun game. As noted in my other reviews from this line, you can play a few simple and worthwhile games with the core set, but if you want to get the most variety out of the game you'll need some expansions. Because the X-Wing also comes in the core set (which is required to play), it is not 100% necessary to get this expansion set to get the most out of the game. But, there are a few additions, so I'd say it is probably worth getting one of this expansion set for most people (if then, if you want more X-Wings or TIE Fighters I'd just buy extra starter sets to get more bang for your buck).

That said, the X-Wing expansion adds two unique pilots that are NOT included in the core set. Pilots include Wedge Antillies (unique) and Garven Dreis (unique). It also includes two generic pilots that come with the core set.

Wedge alone makes this expansion worth getting in my opinion, as he is the highest ranked (Level 9) Rebel pilot in the game, with an awesome offensive special ability, ""When attacking, reduce the defender's agility value by 1 (to a minimum of `0').""

Garven is a level 6 pilot that also has a very nice special ability, ""After spending a focus token, you may place that token on any other friendly ship at Range 1-2 (instead of discarding it)."" Based on the FAQ that was recently released by FFG, it is possible for him to give a focus token to a ship that already has a focus token (which definitely adds to his value).

It also includes several upgrade cards (many, but not all, of which are also available in the starter or other expansions). The expansion includes two astromech droids (R5 Astromech, and R5-K6), Expert Handling, and Proton Torpedoes.

The expansion also includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game.

As noted in all of my reviews of FFG X-Wing products, all the ships look great. However, the X-Wing seems particular fragile because of its thin guns. I've played about a dozen games and haven't had any problems with any ship breaking so far. I am not rough with the ships, but I am not overly careful with them either (except perhaps when storing them).",4.0
"Short version (this is what you NEED to know about this blister before buying)
The game has moved on in the years since it/this was released. Primarily know, yes 1 pack of this is still useful for a Rebel player however, if you want to play it (even semi competitively), you'll probably need a card or two from other packs these days to make the most of it (really, to make it even decent).

Full review (as of late '16)
As the game has shifted in the last few years, the classic t65 X Wing (this one, ""A New Hope"" era) has gradually phased out of use in most games. You just don't see the old girl in the tournament scene now for valid reasons, mainly the t70 X Wing (""Force Awakens""), B Wing, Arc 170, and K Wing have all come along to steal most it's thunder. FFG is aware of this and in recent expansions seems to be adding stuff that can reverse help the ship that killed the Death Star, no one wants this classic staple of Star Wars to be so maligned, but where does it stand for the buyer now?

How many of this expansion blister should I buy?
One will suffice generally. If you're just a collector that's all you'll probably want. If you're a Rebel player, if you use one it's likely an ace and, given its current issues, it's rare to see more than two at once (and one comes in the red base game box, if you need a second get that for Luke not a 2nd of this).

What do I get in this expansion pack I will use?
Wedge as a pilot (who only comes in this pack), thanks to his ability and PS, still sees the table. Of all the original X Wing's, he is the one that almost unarguably is still useful. Best Part Of This Pack. (The fact he's appearing now in SW: Rebels, so a new generation of youngsters is being introduced to him, just makes it all the better).
Expert Handling, an EPT card that this is the only Rebel ship with, and the R5 astromech card, only in this expansion period, are also still usable.
Those three mean this pack is still a solid buy, even if no longer the first thing you should get after the base game.

What will I need to get to make this as good as it can be in the current game?
Because of it's age, it's literally tied for the games oldest ship, there are a few things you'll want to (need to) consider picking up if you want to use it so it can stay competitive against the newer ships it faces.
Primarily, one of the following three cards, in a general order of usefulness.
Choice 1) Integrated Astromech is your default one if you can't decide, from the t70 expansion or the new Heroes of Resistance box set. It's almost a must. If you buy this, and you didn't also buy a t70 expansion blister, get that new x wing individual pack as well since Integrated Astromech is usable on both and is basically a 0pt cost (yes, zero) extra hull/shield point.
Choice 2) Vectored Thrusters, from the Arc 170 expansion, is another card that really helps Wedge, and Luke from the core set (and Wes, if you splurge on the Transport), as it lets high PS turn into some arc dodging antics many foes still don't factor in from a '65. It gives the ship a 3rd action, a Barrel Roll, for a handful of points (again, on aces with high PS that's golden, even more so with cards like Predator thrown on), while not eating up the valuable astromech slot.
Choice 3) Guidance Chip, at a distant 3rd, from the Inquistors TIE or Punishing One expansions (yes, both from other factions) is another possibility since it's probably the best card (an X Wing can take) to enhances torpedoes reliability. If you go this route, you may also want to consider ships that provide Flechette or Plasma Torpedoes to give you more options than just Protons.
NOTE: All three take up the 'Modification' slot, so you can only use one at time. If you buy and get one, you don't need to get the others unless you want to.

Now none of this is going to make your old school X Wing dominant, the 'patches' FFG has done through newer cards that can work on her just haven't reached that point, they will however allow you to use it and not have it be a liability.

Now go have some fun and may the Force be with you.",4.0

"This game is very fun, and the miniatures have great detail, but they are a bit too fragile IMO. My x-wing had one of its lasers on the wing fall off after about two weeks of use, and it just came off as I lifted it out of the plastic packaging that you use to store it in. Not a big deal, the laser didn't ""break"" off necessarily, it was more that the post of the laser mount came out of the hole in the wing, so with a little superglue the thing is now better than new.

Again, these miniatures have some incredible detail (especially the Falcon), but they plastic, and not of the same build quality that you might see from die cast figurines that companies were producing 20-30 years ago. You will need to be very careful with the smaller fighters.",4.0

"I picked this game up at Gen Con Indy 2014 based solely on the highly colorful and stylish artwork.  I grabbed the last copy they had at the booth as it sold out during the four days there.  After playing it several times with my group here are my impressions:

Overall:
The game was a nice find.  The art is gorgeous, the game is short and fun and feels like it is simple enough to master, but varied enough and complex enough to see a lot of replay.  Definitely a game I'd recommend and an excellent game if you're looking for something around the 30min mark (after several playthroughs with a full 5 player group I can say this does lengthen the game to closer to the 45-60 min range depending on how fast your players make choices).

Rules:
  The rules could have been slightly clearer, but overall didn't take much to understand.  The index of cards in the back was a nice touch to explain the more challenging cards.  The game is a simple concept and should be easy enough for even casual gamers, but has enough depth to also keep more avid gamers like myself thoroughly engaged because a lot of the complexity comes from reacting to your opponents rather than the complexity of the game itself.

Gameplay:
Short and sweet is the best way to describe it.  The 3 quick rounds leaves you finished when the game is still fun and wanting to play another match.  Each round 3 random assassination targets are dealt on the table and each player secretly chooses two of them to either guard or assassinate, both with a reward.  You can choose to guard both, assassinate both, or one of each, and you won't know what the opponents have chosen until the end of each round.  Each player drafts various character cards such as ninjas, guards, and specialists with the intent of playing them face down on the various targets on the table.  At the end of the round all cards are revealed and, based on the strength of the cards played, each target is assassinated or successfully guarded respectively.  Player collect their rewards for succeeding at their chosen tasks and two players may end up sharing rewards with other players who chose the same objective, or denying rewards to players who opposed them.  After 3 rounds the player with the most gold earned from their objectives wins.
Gameplay really focuses on two elements in my opinion: playing the cards in your hand in the most efficient way possible, and choosing your targets well based on what you expect the rest of the table to choose so you get the most points to yourself and the least opposition to your goals each round.",4.0
"So, nothing really special here, just more dice for your Star Wars: Imperial Assault adventures.  While these extra dice are not necessary for the game, it is really nice to have them, especially when playing the campaign game when there is up to five players.

"This starter box for the Game of Thrones is sufficient to allow you to play the basic card game with up to 3 friends, but the experience will be somewhat limited.  I will explain the basic gameplay and product contents, and then offer a cheap way to expand the game in a way that would allow you to play stronger decks with people outside your immediate play group.

Gameplay:

The game consists of three basic elements.  Each round begins with all players secretly selecting a ""plot card"" that will affect the amount of resources available to the player (i.e. how many powerful cards he can play that turn) and may also destroy some of the opponent's resources or limit the way players are allowed to interact with each other during the turn.  The cards are revealed simultaneously, so this part of the game has an element of thinking one step ahead of your opponents, which is very faithful to the spirit of the books.  You then use your available resources to either add cards to the board, provide resource boosts to later turns, or preserve those resources for various tricks you can employ to gain a surprise advantage during the last part of the round.

The final part of the round is where the meat of the game is.  Similar to other fantasy card games, you will have the chance to use your characters to initiate attacks against other players.  However, as an added layer of complexity, you can initiate three different types of attacks.  Most characters have at least one type of attack in which they are useless -- as you would expect, children and invalids are rarely useful in military fights but may hold useful political power, while Stark characters are often oblivious to the sort of spying that is the Lannisters' strong suit.  Each attack provides a different type of reward, the value of which varies with the plot card you selected, and the relative worth of which is highly dependent on how deep into the game you've proceeded.  The decisions during this ""challenges phase"" are more difficult to get right than in any other fantasy card game I have played.  That isn't meant to scare you away, because of course if all the players are at a similar skill level then everyone will have the chance to prey on opposing mistakes.  But if one player is much better at unraveling this sort of puzzle, he or she will likely develop a huge skill advantage as you play it more often.

Using this Product:

This core set of the card game includes about 20 cards for each of 8 different ""factions"" representing the families and armies of the Game of Thrones novels and television show.  It also includes dozens of ""neutral"" cards that can be added to any of the factions to supplement their faction's primary strategies.  There are enough cards to build 4 different 40-card decks, by splitting up the 8 factions, but the gameplay in a four-player match using those decks would be rather clunky.  That is because, while you are allowed to use up to 3 copies of a particular card in your deck, this core set only provides single copies of most cards.  The upside is that you get copies of many different popular characters, making it likely that you can play with your favorites.  The downside is that your decks will lack the synergy and strategic focus they would have if you owned multiple copies of each card.  You get to see about 10-12 random cards before play even begins, then draw two per turn, so if you had 3 copies of a particular character you would draw it a reasonable percentage of your games and could make it a lynchpin to your strategy.  Being able to craft a coherent strategy from the available cards is part of the fun in playing customizable card games, and you won't get much of that with just this box.  Additionally, if you want to play outside of your own kitchen-table group of friends, you will probably be expected to abide by ""tournament rules"" of deck construction at most hobby stores with game space.  Tournament rules require larger 60-card decks, and it will not be possible to construct more than 1 tournament-legal deck from this box.

Some very serious players will suggest purchasing three copies of this same core set if you want to get the full experience, however you might find that a bit extreme if you aren't playing competitively at local tournaments or haven't had experience with many customizable card games before.  My alternative suggestion is to purchase one core set plus one of the premium expansion boxes, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Game-of-Thrones-LCG-2nd-Edition-Wolves-of-the-North-Deluxe-Expansion-Card-Game/dp/B0193MPJGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Game of Thrones LCG 2nd Edition: Wolves of the North Deluxe Expansion Card Game</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Game-of-Thrones-LCG-2nd-Edition-Lions-of-Casterly-Rock-Game/dp/B01GPELA6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Game of Thrones LCG 2nd Edition: Lions of Casterly Rock Game</a>.  The deluxe expansion boxes come with dozens of new unique cards, and unlike the core set they include three copies of each card.  Each box contains suggestions on how to build strong decks centered around that expansion's theme while using only the cards from a single core set plus that particular expansion.  For example, Wolves of the North contains many new Stark family cards, and provides you with pre-made lists to build two very different Stark-focused decks -- for example, you are instructed how to build a deck using the family's direwolf companions as a central part of your game strategy.  Over time, the game designers will be making a deluxe expansion for each faction, so depending on when you read this more may be available.  All cards contained in deluxe expansions are ""tournament legal"" indefinitely, so you can play them not only with your friends but at local game shops for years to come.

Product Quality & Accessories:

The quality of the cardstock appeared durable, but many players use protective sleeves.  The cards are ""standard size"" for purposes of buying sleeves from Ultra Pro, KMC, DragonShield or any of those excellent gaming supply providers.  The game also comes with cardboard tokens to represent the scoring mechanisms and to use as ""gold"" spent on putting characters into play from your hand.  These are not particularly fancy, but they are not flimsy either.  You can use anything you like for tokens, if you don't have enough ""gold"" for a four player game just use pennies.  If you want to get fancy, there are gaming accessory stores that sell really nice tokens, including some with Game of Thrones themes, such as these coins featuring Aegon Targaryen on the back!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/15-Aegon-V-Targaryen-Half-Pennies-Game-of-Thrones-Gaming-Coins/dp/B01D3UYH2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">15 Aegon V Targaryen Half-Pennies - Game of Thrones Gaming Coins</a>&nbsp;Accessories like these might be a neat idea to throw in if you're giving this as a gift to a board gamer who is a big fan of these stories.

The card art does a fine job of representing the game setting.  It isn't particularly diverse, it's fairly conventional fantasy art with no art styles radically departing from the norm, but it never detracts from the game.  Note that this game uses fantasy art based on the novels, and does NOT use any stills or images from the television show, presumably because of either licensing cost or because the original edition of the game predated the TV show by several years.  The art is faithful to the descriptions of these people and places, and I think you'll find you have no trouble recognizing these memorable characters, but they aren't going to look exactly like the actors portraying the character on the screen.

Summary:

I believe that you will get a 5-star experience from this game if you are BOTH a huge fan of Game of Thrones AND a huge fan of fantasy card games with a lot of ""combat math"" puzzles (such as the ""draft"" format for Magic the Gathering.)  If you just like the setting, and are not very strong at those sorts of game, I think you will still enjoy the game a lot, provided you find a way to balance the relative skill levels of the people you are playing with.",4.0
"I've played dozens of LCGs/CCGs (yes, dozens) and AGOT is among the best mechanics-wise. I didn't have much invested in first edition cards so don't feel shafted by Fantasy Flight suddenly making my collection worthless.  This is a 'gamer's' game. It's very tactical. Casual gamers and just fans of GoT aren't likely to take to it. Mostly they'll be overwhelmed by the number of choices you have to make each turn. This ain't Monopoly.

If you have the brain power and inclination to take on a complex game AGOT is highly recommended.

However, this so called starter set is rather 'meh.'  The card mix is so unfocused that you can't make even one competitive deck from what you get in the box. Be prepared to shell out another $75-$100 dollars if you want to make a functioning deck. That's not just my opinion. In the game they have you making non legal 40-card decks so you can play a semblance of the game. This ain't really the game, more like a rules tutorial. But if you're going to get into a CCG/LCG you have to be prepared to spend $100s to get the full experience.",4.0
"As a fan of games like Arkham Horror and Magic: The Gathering as well as HBO's popular series, I was delighted to receive this game for review. The portrayal of characters and themes is true to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire/dp/0553381687/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>&nbsp;with all original artwork (no scenes from the show); gameplay is typical Fantasy Flight, meaning you'll need three or four play sessions and a few friendly arguments to settle on the rules. All in all, a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours... and you don't even have to kick the kids out of the room first.",4.0

"Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! How do you win this game?  You must call upon such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, and many others.  You are challenged to balance your allies, and out maneuver your challengers.

This game takes between 1 to 2 hours to play.  Each player has two desk a draw deck and plot deck.  The draw deck contains the warring elements of your struggle that includes characters, locations, and events you will go through to win the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire.

This game has had some modifications from the first version, elements were dropped, and some additional character cards were added.  This is a fun game that is easy to pick up and to play.",4.0
Good fun. Very cutthroat. Mechanics mirror source well. Games run a bit longer than is fun sometimes.,4.0
"There's a lot of different cards/play-styles in the box. It's a bit difficult to learn if you're unfamiliar with similar games. But, if you like games with plenty of complexity and choices, it may be for you. In the few games of 2-player ""joust"" I've played, it seems like once one player gets an advantage, it's very difficult for the other player to recover. This might just be because I haven't enough experience to learn how to recover, not sure. Either way, it's fun. And new cards to be released may fix this if it's indeed an issue.",4.0
"This game feels somewhat interchangeable with other recent games and somewhat superfluous as a result, however the gameplay will be familiar to those fans of fantasy card/strategy games and will be especially fun for big time GOT fans. As fans of RPG/fantasy/strategy card games and GOT ourselves, we are happy to add it to our collection, despite the fact that I don't think it will win any awards.",4.0
"Fun game, nicely put together. The art is excellent, gameplay is simple, but with lots of room for strategic play. Lots of fun.",4.0
"With the holidays coming I've been trying to find a great gift for a couple that the hubs and I are friends with. As it happens we are all MTG players and GoT fans so I was hoping having the opp to review this would help me decide if I wanted to purchase this for them. The gameplay seems to be in the same realm as MTG but I love that this game doesn't become a money pit in the same manner. The cards are gorgeous, making this lovely from the collector side. All in all, I like it a lot and I think it's exactly the thing I was looking to purchase for my friends.",4.0
"I picked this game to play because my husband and I are fans of the television show. I have not read the books yet. So I wanted to see how this game was. I read others thoughts on this game. I do have to agree that if you have never played a living card game before than it will take a lot of patience to learn all of the rules. You will probably have to refer to them many times through out the play of the game to remember what step is next. Or you could go watch this video by the makers of this game on Youtube titled ""A Game of Thrones: The Card Game Second Edition Tutorial"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1s54Wlgfyo

This video as mentioned by another reviewer is very helpful in understanding the rules of the game. You may even be able to just watch the video and not have to read the rule book.

Again, if you have never played a living card game than I would suggest you play the tutorial game that is suggested in the rule book. It is a shorter version but it will really help you get the concept of the game down. Suggested for 2 players. Which is the best as once you have mastered the tutorial game than you can bring in more players to see who can conquer for world dominion.",4.0
"An intense and engrossing game that requires a bit of dedication to absorb.  Like GOT, this game is all about conquest and treachery.  If you're a veteran of dynamic card games, this game will prove a challenge.  All of the materials are very well deigned with original artwork.  It doesn't use anything from the show and is more based on the books by George R R Martin, as it should be.  All materials are high quality.  It can be easy to damage playing cards like these.  They have rounded edges and are coated to help make them a little resistant to moisture.

There's a 16 page ""Learn to Play"" booklet and a 32 page ""Rules Reference"" booklet.  It will take time and effort to get accustomed to the rules and the intended game flow.  Best suited for those who like and excel at complicated games.",4.0
"Ok, I'm not a Game of Thrones fan. Tried the show a couple times, but just could not get into it. However, I feel that you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this game. I found the game to be interesting and fun, but I will have to say that it seems to be a bit more complex than I care for in my games. The cards are beautiful and easy to understand. Fantasy Flight always does a fine job with a game's presentation. I did read the rules and had quite a number of questions once I had read them. Thankfully, I have a friend that had played the first edition of this game and with his help, we were able to get in a few games of it with his help. Btw, I had never played the first edition. After our third game (we only played 2 player) I felt I was finally getting the hang of the game. We did have to keep referring to the rules and those are fairly clear and doesn't take long to look things up.
 If you're into meaty card games or Game of Thrones, then this game is simply an no brainer.",4.0
My husband and I really love GOT card game. We just got confused at first on how to use it.,4.0
"First off, the game is beautiful. The artwork on the cards is top notch. There's a pretty steep learning curve. It's a pretty complicated game that has a lot of phases and rules. The first time playing is pretty rough, but after everything is established, it's a pretty fun game. Recommended for fans of strategic, competitive games and the Game of Thrones books or TV show.",4.0
"My husband and I love the television show and I have devoured the books so it made sense for us to add this card game to our collection.  While setting up the game, we had no problem but then became a little confused when we started to play.  Not a crisis.  There are videos available on youtube with clear tutorials so we were able to figure out what we needed to do.

After playing the game one time, we agreed that it seems like it may be fun but we want to give it another go.  I do like that the game rules allow two people to figure out how to play the game, to get a feel for the various steps of the game, how to earn power (the goal is to gain 15 power tokens to win the game), and what to do in each phase.  There is a recommendation to begin using two particular houses:  Stark and Lannister.  Anyone who is a fan of the books and/or television show will appreciate why these two are a perfect choice for starting.

However, the first time we played, we kept referring to the rules and that slowed things down.  This is why we both agree that we not only want to play it again just the two of us but also play it with a third or fourth person so we can get a better feel for the game.  I would like to see if we can find someone who is unfamiliar with the books/show to play with us because I have a feeling that a non-fan may not find the game as much fun.  Then again, I could be wrong. So I am going to give this game 4 stars because my husband and I definitely enjoyed it and I can say with some confidence that our confusion is not indicative of how well explained the game play is.  (We just confuse a bit easily because one of us tends to overthink everything.)  Should we find a non-fan to play with us and that person enjoys the game as much as we do Ill joyfully update this review and give the game 5 stars.

I cant wait to play this game again!  Neither can my husband! Nuff said.",4.0
"We really like this-first let it be known it is not a simple and quick game. Made that much harder if your not familiar with these type of card games. By the way you will most likely need more cards That being said with some time and patience you will/could love and enjoy this game. Game play is fun, hardcore GOT fans will thoroughly enjoy this!",4.0
"This is a pretty complex game and not something you can just pick up and start playing.  Expect to read the rules thoroughly and then still have a bit of confusion about how things are.  This is definitely a game for the hardcore gamer, not the casual one.  If you are a GoT fan you has never really been into gaming, this game may be a little overwhelming for you.

However, for the dedicated gamers who are GoT fans, this is definitely a fun experience as you build power to take the throne.  The cards are really nice looking.  I've always found Fantasy Flight Games to make nice games, and this one is no exception.

This games is suitable for teenagers and adults so it is not a family game to play with younger children.  Play time takes a while, especially in the earlier games where you are pausing to clarify rules, so make sure to set aside a couple of hours.

Overall, this is a really nice game for gamers, especially those who are GoT fans.  I would  not recommend this for casual gamers however.",4.0
"I am a big Game of Thrones Fan, so I was excited to receive this card game.

This is not a simple card game, in fact it's quite challenging to learn. If you're not used to these types of games expect to play a few times through just to learn the rules. Better yet, get with someone who understands card games well or who has played this.

It is a beautiful game, and knowledge of GoT is really helpful. It seems very well constructed. My only complaint is that it could use more cards.

Not something I'll play with the wife and kids, but with my hardcore gamer friends.",4.0
"My husband and I had played the original Game of Thrones LCG extensively and although I welcome a new edition, he was a bit upset and felt that this wastes all the money we spent into buying cards for the first edition. Compared to the first edition, the mechanics seem slightly simpler although this game is by no means easy to pick up. Even having played the first edition, it took us two ""demo"" games to really get in the groove. The instructions give a step-by-step demo game with decks to use for this (it's a 2 person duel, not a melee). This was helpful although the decks given are quite small and it's easy to run out of cards.

Speaking of decks, the game doesn't come with enough cards to put together a proper one. It comes with many different factions (there are a lot more factions than in the first edition base game) but there are not enough of these and the neutral cards to put together a tournament deck. I AM enjoying this so I plan to buy another base game or some additional packs.

The tokens and cards are high quality although my husband missed some things from the first edition (the game board and the little statues for the different roles). These things were not a big deal for me and I actually think the artwork on the cards is improved since the first version. The rules reference seems thorough and we didn't run into any situations YET that the rules did not clarify.

Overall, this is a fun game with a steep learning curve that may take hours to play (and at times is incredibly frustrating). It's hard to keep track of all the cards on the table, mechanics in play, number of power everyone has, etc. It is very fun though to play as a faction from the books/show that you like (or don't) and the faction options are great (night's watch is a welcome addition here). I really do wish I could put together a bigger deck with this base game and that is probably my biggest complaint.",4.0
"So a couple of things to note about this game that others might find useful. Yes, I am  GoT fan, but I  also enjoying some of these living card / deck building games that are not genre or fan specific like Dominion. I think someone who enjoys games can find this game worthwhile even if they are not a fan of the series, book or movie.

Now in the way of components, the game has a lot to offer. The tokens are quality cardboard, not super thin and I had no issues popping them out without tears or ripping. I wish they had a baggie or something to store them in instead of just an open space in the box, but that can be remedied easily enough. Now the cards contain really nice artwork to the point where after time, your eye is going to easily recognized the cards since they're so unique, well themed and reflect a scene that the actions and text of the card refer to. I mean I really enjoy these. They do seem a little on the large side, but it's been so long since I've used just regular play cards maybe I am just used to the small ones now.

Anyway, as far as gameplay goes, what I really like about this game is you are playing a faction, or as fans might call them, a House (except the Nigh Watch which might be the reason for the faction statement. This isn't just a color or a visual difference. The cards you play are going to change based on this faction and therefore how you play might adjust itself as well. Since Jon Snow and Cersei have different strengths, you're probably going to wind up playing to the strengths of the best cards you have available. Although this is a deck-building game, there are nice suggestions on what cards to start with in a deck, and I always find that is the best approach to take until everyone is comfortable enough with the cards to choose a playing style.

Now I haven't played a lot of Fantasy Flight Games, odd I know as a person who really enjoys physical games. I don't know if they normally do this or not, but i was a little disappointed that the tutorial is 2 player based for a game that advertises 2-4 players. In most cases, I am always going to have 3 or more people learning a new game with me as most the games I play start with a minimum of 3 anyway. The Joust rules are clear,  shows examples, and well everything a tutorial should be. The Melee Rules , the rules for 3 to 6 players (6 with expansions) and covered on 2 pages compared to the 8 for the tutorial. This isn't to say the tutorial isn't useful for 3... I just wish  they had focused on 3 instead of two. With the tutorial and the melee rules, the game proved a little challenging to pick up but not impossible. I am sure it will flow naturally after a few more play throughs.

Now about the second book, the Rules Reference. I feel like companies are often trying to design their games so you don't have to reference additional sources while playing, which is great... however, many of them fail in this effort, so I really appreciate having physical reference should a question come up like the word Cannot is absolute cannot be countermanded by other abilities. This is the kind of granular questions either new players need to clear things up or seasoned players need to reference to settle disagreement.

Overall, the game flows nicely, gives a nice nod to fans of the series and is in a relatively small and quality box to remain on the active and ready to play shelf of my collection. it's also small enough to carry around too. I would say the play is closer to 2 hours then 1 when you have any new players at all (they won't know the symbols and have to look them up a lot. They're all over the cards). I am not yet compelled to run out and buy more of the game, but you never know, it has the potential to be a favorite.

I will definitely not think twice about buying more FFG games in the future as well. This is quality stuff although they could work on their box storage a bit. I know there's a company out there making quality inserts to remedy this problem, but I would prefer to just get good storage options for the box, well out of the box.",4.0
"To start, I've not played the first edition of this game, so will not be using it as a frame of reference for this review and cannot speak to the specific changes. The artwork on the cards, done by various artists, is beautiful and vibrant. The print quality is excellent as art the materials.

Getting to the gameplay--it's complicated. I'd recommend watching the YouTube tutorial provided by the makers, then reading the instruction manual once through (there is even a separate booklet with the rules). There are a lot of moving parts, so to speak, and it's easy to make a mistake or three in the beginning.

The first game--a two player joust following the walk-through set up provided in the first book--took nearly three hours since neither of us felt entirely comfortable with the game mechanics. After the first few games, the game play became a lot easier to breeze through (and by breeze through, I mean play in roughly two hours instead of three). That said, once you get the hang of it, this game is rather addictive especially if you enjoy strategy games.

Overall, this is a great game to kill a few hours. You needn't have read the books or watched the series to play either. It only asks that you use some critical thinking and pre-planning, and it's a fun way to pass a few hours.",4.0

If its touched or the stand is moved its pretty much a given the model is going to fall off of the stand. Major fail on Eaglemoss's  end for a toy that retails for 35 to 50 dollars in the US.

Instead I found these to be valuable to show how white light (say sunlight) passing through these sheets will become colored.
